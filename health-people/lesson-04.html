        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Public Health in Medieval Towns</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Medieval towns were unhealthy and unpleasant. Rapid growth, no scientific knowledge, and weak local governments meant most towns faced serious <dfn class="term" data-def="The health of the population as a whole, and the measures taken by authorities to protect it &mdash; including clean water, waste disposal, and disease prevention.">public health</dfn> problems. These conditions set the stage for the Black Death in 1348.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n3">The Key Problems</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Most medieval towns faced the same problems:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n5">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Public Health Problems in Towns</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Waste:</strong> There were no proper sewer systems. Household rubbish and human waste were thrown into the streets or dumped into rivers. <dfn class="term" data-def="Pits dug near houses to collect human waste. They frequently overflowed and contaminated nearby water sources, contributing to the spread of disease.">Cesspits</dfn> overflowed regularly and contaminated the surrounding area.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Wells and rivers were often contaminated by nearby cesspits and industrial waste from butchers, tanners, and dyers. There was no understanding that dirty water could spread disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Overcrowding:</strong> Cramped, smoky houses packed closely together helped spread diseases like <dfn class="term" data-def="A highly infectious bacterial disease that attacks the lungs, spread through airborne droplets. Overcrowded medieval housing created ideal conditions for its spread.">tuberculosis</dfn>. Families often shared single rooms, and ventilation was poor.</li>
            <li><strong>Animals:</strong> Livestock were kept within town walls and animal waste added to the filth. Butchers slaughtered animals in the streets and dumped offal in open areas.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">The main reasons were <strong>no scientific knowledge</strong> and <strong>weak local governments</strong>. People did not know about germs. They believed bad smells &mdash; <dfn class="term" data-def="The theory that disease was caused by &lsquo;bad air&rsquo; or foul-smelling vapours rising from rotting matter, swamps, or sewage. This theory was widely believed from ancient times until the acceptance of germ theory in the late 19th century.">miasma</dfn> &mdash; caused disease. Town councils had limited power and money to enforce public health rules.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">Attempts at Improvement</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">Medieval towns were not completely lawless. Town councils did try to manage the filth, even if their efforts were often small-scale and inconsistent:</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>What did town councils try to do?</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n9"><strong>Fines:</strong> Councils fined people for dumping waste in the street. But enforcement was patchy and fines were often too small to stop it.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n10"><strong>Muck-rakers:</strong> Some towns hired <dfn class="term" data-def="Workers hired by medieval town councils to clear the worst rubbish and waste from the streets. Their work was limited in scope and could not keep up with the volume of waste produced.">muck-rakers</dfn> to clear the worst rubbish. Their work was limited and could not keep up with the constant dumping.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n11"><strong>Gong farmers:</strong> <dfn class="term" data-def="Workers paid to empty cesspits and privies (outdoor toilets), usually working at night due to the unpleasant nature of the job. They were an early form of waste management in medieval towns.">Gong farmers</dfn> were paid to empty cesspits and privies, usually at night &mdash; one of the worst jobs in medieval society.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n12"><strong>Water supply:</strong> Some towns provided clean water through <dfn class="term" data-def="Channels or pipes used to carry clean water from springs or rivers into a town. Some medieval towns invested in conduits to improve their water supply.">conduits</dfn> and maintained public wells. London&rsquo;s Great Conduit (1236) carried fresh water from springs outside the city.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n13"><strong>Public bathhouses:</strong> Available in some towns, though they declined over time due to fears about spreading disease and immorality.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Specific Public Health Laws</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1298:</strong> King Edward I ordered public toilets to be built in York because conditions were too unhygienic for his soldiers.</li>
            <li><strong>1330:</strong> Glamorgan council banned butchers from throwing waste onto streets.</li>
            <li><strong>1371:</strong> London banned the killing of large animals within the city.</li>
            <li><strong>1388:</strong> Parliament passed a law fining people &pound;20 (equivalent to roughly &pound;15,000 today) for throwing waste into rivers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These laws show that authorities <strong>were</strong> aware of the problems and tried to act &mdash; but enforcement was difficult and the measures were rarely enough to make a significant difference.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n14">Monasteries: The Exception</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">Unlike filthy towns, <dfn class="term" data-def="Religious communities where monks lived according to strict rules. Monasteries had the wealth, knowledge, and discipline to maintain excellent public health standards, including clean water supplies and proper waste disposal.">monasteries</dfn> were often the cleanest and healthiest places in medieval Britain. Monks had the resources and discipline to create public health systems far ahead of anything in towns.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n16">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why Were Monasteries So Clean?</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wealth and knowledge:</strong> Monasteries had the money and education to build advanced water and sanitation systems. They could afford to plan and maintain infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Excellent sanitation:</strong> They built latrines (toilets) that carried waste away through drainage channels, keeping it separate from their water supply.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh water:</strong> Many monasteries had piped water supplies, using lead or wooden pipes to bring clean water from springs directly into the monastery grounds.</li>
            <li><strong>Routine and hygiene:</strong> The monastic rule required regular washing, clean clothing, and organised daily routines. This discipline helped maintain high standards of cleanliness.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare facilities:</strong> Monasteries had infirmaries for sick monks, herb gardens for growing medicinal plants, and access to medical texts preserved in their libraries.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">This contrast shows that the <strong>knowledge and resources existed</strong> to create better public health &mdash; but most towns lacked the money, authority, and organisation to do it.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n18">The Black Death (1348&ndash;1350)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">The <dfn class="term" data-def="A devastating pandemic that reached England in 1348. It killed between one-third and one-half of the population and had profound short-term and long-term consequences for public health, medicine, and society.">Black Death</dfn> was the most catastrophic event in medieval history. It arrived in England in summer 1348 and swept across the country at terrifying speed. By 1350, it had killed <strong>one-third to one-half of England&rsquo;s population</strong> &mdash; an estimated 1.5 to 2.5 million people. We now know it was caused by the bacterium <dfn class="term" data-def="The bacterium responsible for plague. It is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, which live on rats. Medieval people had no knowledge of bacteria and could not have identified the true cause.">Yersinia pestis</dfn>, carried by fleas on rats &mdash; but medieval people had no knowledge of this.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n20">How Did It Arrive?</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">The Black Death started in Central Asia and spread west along trade routes. It reached Europe on merchant ships carrying infected rats and fleas. The disease arrived at Melcombe Regis (now Weymouth) in Dorset in June 1348 and spread rapidly through England over the next two years.</p>

        <p>Europe was already weakened before the plague arrived. <strong>Poor harvests in the five years before 1348</strong> had left much of the population malnourished and vulnerable. When the plague struck, weakened immune systems meant people had even less ability to fight it off.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n22">Types and Symptoms</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">The Black Death took two main forms:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n24">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Two Forms of Plague</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="The most common form of plague, spread by flea bites. Symptoms included swollen lymph nodes (buboes), fever, headaches, and vomiting. It killed around 60&ndash;70% of those infected within a week.">Bubonic plague</dfn>:</strong> Spread by flea bites from infected rats. Symptoms included painful swollen lumps in the groin, armpits, or neck (called <dfn class="term" data-def="Large, painful swellings of the lymph nodes caused by bubonic plague, typically appearing in the groin, armpits, or neck. They could grow as large as an egg or apple.">buboes</dfn>), high fever, headaches, vomiting, and a rash of dark blotches on the skin. Around 60&ndash;70% of those infected died, usually within a week.</li>
            <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A more deadly form of plague that attacked the lungs. It was spread through coughing and sneezing, making it highly contagious. It was almost always fatal, often killing within 24&ndash;48 hours.">Pneumonic plague</dfn>:</strong> Attacked the lungs and was spread through coughing and sneezing. This form was even more contagious and almost always fatal, often killing within 24&ndash;48 hours. Victims coughed up blood and struggled to breathe.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n25">What Did People Believe Caused It?</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n26">Without knowledge of germs, people desperately searched for explanations:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n27">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Believed Causes of the Black Death</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>God&rsquo;s punishment:</strong> The most common explanation. People believed God was punishing humanity for its sins. This led to extreme religious responses including flagellation.</li>
            <li><strong>Miasma (bad air):</strong> Many believed the plague was caused by foul-smelling air from rotting matter, swamps, or earthquakes releasing poisonous gases from underground.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment of the planets:</strong> In 1348, the medical faculty at the University of Paris declared that a conjunction of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars had corrupted the air and caused the plague.</li>
            <li><strong>Jewish communities:</strong> In some parts of Europe, Jewish people were falsely blamed for poisoning wells, leading to horrific persecution and massacres.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n28">Attempted Treatments and Prevention</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n29">People tried many methods to prevent or cure the plague, all based on their mistaken beliefs about its causes:</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">

The movement was eventually condemned by the Pope.">flagellants</dfn> travelled town to town, publicly whipping themselves to beg God to end the plague. The Pope eventually condemned the movement.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n31"><strong>Carrying posies and herbs:</strong> People carried flowers, herbs, and spices to ward off &ldquo;bad air.&rdquo; Some held vinegar-soaked cloths over their noses.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n32"><strong>Bloodletting and purging:</strong> Physicians applied standard humoral treatments &mdash; bleeding patients and prescribing laxatives. These were completely useless against plague.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n33"><strong>Quarantine:</strong> Some towns tried <dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of isolating sick people or restricting movement to prevent the spread of disease. During the Black Death, some towns boarded up infected houses or refused entry to travellers from affected areas.">quarantine</dfn>, boarding up infected houses or refusing entry to travellers from affected areas. This was one of the few measures that actually worked.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n34"><strong>Prayer and processions:</strong> Churches held special services and masses to beg God for mercy. Many people made pilgrimages to holy shrines.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n35"><strong>Fires and bells:</strong> Some believed smoke or vibrations from church bells could drive off the miasma.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n36">The Impact of the Black Death</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n37">The Black Death had consequences far beyond the death toll itself:</p>

          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">1348&ndash;1350</div>
            <h4>The Black Death kills between one-third and one-half of England&rsquo;s population</h4>
            <p>An estimated 1.5&ndash;2.5 million people died. Some villages were completely wiped out. Labour became desperately scarce.</p>

            <div class="timeline-date">1349 onwards</div>
            <h4>Labour shortage transforms society</h4>
            <p>With so many dead, surviving peasants could demand higher wages and better conditions. Some left their manors to find better-paid work elsewhere, weakening the feudal system.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">1351</div>
            <h4>Statute of Labourers</h4>
            <p>The government attempted to freeze wages at pre-plague levels and prevent peasants from leaving their manors. This caused widespread resentment and was largely unenforceable.</p>

            <h4>Plague returns repeatedly</h4>
            <p>The Black Death was not a one-off event. It returned in waves throughout the 14th century and beyond, continuing to disrupt society and reinforce the belief that disease was God&rsquo;s punishment.</p>

Some practical steps were taken: quarantine, mass plague pits, street cleaning. But the scale of death overwhelmed any organised response.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n40"><strong>Long-term:</strong> The plague forced people to question why traditional remedies and prayer had failed. It did not change medical theory overnight, but it planted seeds of doubt. The huge labour shortage shifted power from landowners to peasants, and some towns began taking public health more seriously. Repeated outbreaks also led to <strong>quarantine</strong> developing as a public health measure.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n41"><strong>Impact on the Church:</strong> Prayer had failed to stop the plague, weakening the Church&rsquo;s authority. Many priests died, leaving parishes without leadership. Some people began questioning whether the Church had all the answers &mdash; though this shift was gradual and would not fully develop until the Renaissance and Reformation.</p>

              <p>When plague returned to London in 1665 &mdash; over <strong>300 years</strong> later &mdash; people <strong>still did not know the real cause</strong>. The responses were very similar to 1348, showing how little understanding had changed.</p>
              <p>London authorities issued <strong>&ldquo;Plague Orders&rdquo;</strong> that included a range of measures:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Quarantine of infected houses:</strong> Homes where plague was found were locked shut for 40 days, with a red cross painted on the door and a watchman posted outside to prevent anyone leaving.</li>
                <li><strong>Killing stray dogs and cats:</strong> Authorities ordered the slaughter of stray animals, ironically removing some of the very creatures that killed the rats carrying the disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Banning large gatherings:</strong> Public events and meetings were restricted to limit the spread of infection.</li>
                <li><strong>Burning infected clothes and bedding:</strong> Belongings of plague victims were destroyed in an attempt to stop the disease spreading.</li>
                <li><strong>Women &ldquo;searchers&rdquo;:</strong> Women were paid to examine the sick and the dead, identifying plague cases so that households could be quarantined.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The Great Plague of 1665 killed about <strong>100,000 people in London</strong> &mdash; roughly a quarter of the city. Three centuries apart, the two outbreaks show a striking pattern: without understanding <dfn class="term" data-def="The bacterium responsible for plague.

        <p>Don&rsquo;t describe medieval towns as completely filthy with no rules. For top marks, show <strong>nuance</strong>: acknowledge the serious problems, but give specific examples of attempts to improve &mdash; gong farmers, fines, conduits. When writing about the Black Death, don&rsquo;t just list the horrors &mdash; explain <em>why</em> people responded the way they did, linking responses to their beliefs about what caused disease.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Medieval towns were unhealthy due to contaminated water, street waste, and overcrowding &mdash; but not completely lawless. Efforts like muck-rakers and fines show people did try. Monasteries proved better public health was possible with resources and organisation. The Black Death of 1348 was a turning point &mdash; its catastrophic death toll exposed the limits of existing medical knowledge and began to weaken trust in traditional remedies and Church authority.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Medieval towns had serious public health problems:</strong> Contaminated water, street waste, overcrowding, and miasma theory all contributed. But councils did try to improve conditions &mdash; showing this balance matters for top marks.</li>
          <li><strong>The Black Death killed one-third to one-half of England&rsquo;s population:</strong> Arriving in 1348, people blamed God, miasma, planets, and minority groups. Only quarantine had any real effect.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term consequences were significant:</strong> The plague weakened the feudal system, damaged Church authority, and encouraged people to question traditional medicine &mdash; laying groundwork for the Renaissance.</li>
        </ul>
