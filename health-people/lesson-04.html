        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Public Health in Medieval Towns</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Medieval towns were unhealthy and unpleasant. Rapid growth, no scientific knowledge, and weak local governments meant most towns faced serious <dfn class="term" data-def="The health of the population as a whole, and the measures taken by authorities to protect it &mdash; including clean water, waste disposal, and disease prevention.">public health</dfn> problems. These conditions set the stage for the Black Death in 1348.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n3">The Key Problems</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Most medieval towns faced the same problems:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n5">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Public Health Problems in Towns</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Waste:</strong> There were no proper sewer systems. Household rubbish and human waste were thrown into the streets or dumped into rivers. <dfn class="term" data-def="Pits dug near houses to collect human waste.">Cesspits</dfn> overflowed regularly and contaminated the surrounding area.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Wells and rivers were often contaminated by nearby cesspits and industrial waste from butchers, tanners, and dyers. There was no understanding that dirty water could spread disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Overcrowding:</strong> Cramped, smoky houses packed closely together helped spread diseases like <dfn class="term" data-def="A highly infectious bacterial disease that attacks the lungs, spread through airborne droplets.">tuberculosis</dfn>. Families often shared single rooms, and ventilation was poor.</li>
            <li><strong>Animals:</strong> Livestock were kept within town walls and animal waste added to the filth. Butchers slaughtered animals in the streets and dumped offal in open areas.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">The main reasons were <strong>no scientific knowledge</strong> and <strong>weak local governments</strong>. People did not know about germs. They believed bad smells &mdash; <dfn class="term" data-def="The theory that disease was caused by &lsquo;bad air&rsquo; or foul-smelling vapours rising from rotting matter, swamps, or sewage.">miasma</dfn> &mdash; caused disease. Town councils had limited power and money to enforce public health rules.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">Attempts at Improvement</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">Medieval towns were not completely lawless. Town councils did try to manage the filth, even if their efforts were often small-scale and inconsistent:</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>What did town councils try to do?</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n9"><strong>Fines:</strong> Councils fined people for dumping waste in the street. But enforcement was patchy and fines were often too small to stop it.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n10"><strong>Muck-rakers:</strong> Some towns hired <dfn class="term" data-def="Workers hired by medieval town councils to clear the worst rubbish and waste from the streets.">muck-rakers</dfn> to clear the worst rubbish. Their work was limited and could not keep up with the constant dumping.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n11"><strong>Gong farmers:</strong> <dfn class="term" data-def="Workers paid to empty cesspits and privies (outdoor toilets), usually working at night due to the unpleasant nature of the job.">Gong farmers</dfn> were paid to empty cesspits and privies, usually at night &mdash; one of the worst jobs in medieval society.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n12"><strong>Water supply:</strong> Some towns provided clean water through <dfn class="term" data-def="Channels or pipes used to carry clean water from springs or rivers into a town.">conduits</dfn> and maintained public wells. London&rsquo;s Great Conduit (1236) carried fresh water from springs outside the city.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n13"><strong>Public bathhouses:</strong> Available in some towns, though they declined over time due to fears about spreading disease and immorality.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Specific Public Health Laws</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1298:</strong> King Edward I ordered public toilets to be built in York because conditions were too unhygienic for his soldiers.</li>
            <li><strong>1330:</strong> Glamorgan council banned butchers from throwing waste onto streets.</li>
            <li><strong>1371:</strong> London banned the killing of large animals within the city.</li>
            <li><strong>1388:</strong> Parliament passed a law fining people &pound;20 (equivalent to roughly &pound;15,000 today) for throwing waste into rivers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These laws show that authorities <strong>were</strong> aware of the problems and tried to act &mdash; but enforcement was difficult and the measures were rarely enough to make a significant difference.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n14">Monasteries: The Exception</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">Unlike filthy towns, <dfn class="term" data-def="Religious communities where monks lived according to strict rules.">monasteries</dfn> were often the cleanest and healthiest places in medieval Britain. Monks had the resources and discipline to create public health systems far ahead of anything in towns.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n16">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why Were Monasteries So Clean?</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wealth and knowledge:</strong> Monasteries had the money and education to build advanced water and sanitation systems. They could afford to plan and maintain infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Excellent sanitation:</strong> They built latrines (toilets) that carried waste away through drainage channels, keeping it separate from their water supply.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh water:</strong> Many monasteries had piped water supplies, using lead or wooden pipes to bring clean water from springs directly into the monastery grounds.</li>
            <li><strong>Routine and hygiene:</strong> The monastic rule required regular washing, clean clothing, and organised daily routines. This discipline helped maintain high standards of cleanliness.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare facilities:</strong> Monasteries had infirmaries for sick monks, herb gardens for growing medicinal plants, and access to medical texts preserved in their libraries.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">This contrast shows that the <strong>knowledge and resources existed</strong> to create better public health &mdash; but most towns lacked the money, authority, and organisation to do it.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n18">The Black Death (1348&ndash;1350)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">The <dfn class="term" data-def="A devastating pandemic that reached England in 1348.">Black Death</dfn> was the most catastrophic event in medieval history. It arrived in England in summer 1348 and swept across the country at terrifying speed. By 1350, it had killed <strong>one-third to one-half of England&rsquo;s population</strong> &mdash; an estimated 1.5 to 2.5 million people. We now know it was caused by the bacterium <dfn class="term" data-def="The bacterium responsible for plague.">Yersinia pestis</dfn>, carried by fleas on rats &mdash; but medieval people had no knowledge of this.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n20">How Did It Arrive?</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">The Black Death started in Central Asia and spread west along trade routes. It reached Europe on merchant ships carrying infected rats and fleas. The disease arrived at Melcombe Regis (now Weymouth) in Dorset in June 1348 and spread rapidly through England over the next two years.</p>

        <p>Europe was already weakened before the plague arrived. <strong>Poor harvests in the five years before 1348</strong> had left much of the population malnourished and vulnerable. When the plague struck, weakened immune systems meant people had even less ability to fight it off.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n22">Types and Symptoms</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">The Black Death took two main forms:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n24">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Two Forms of Plague</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="The most common form of plague, spread by flea bites.">Bubonic plague</dfn>:</strong> Spread by flea bites from infected rats. Symptoms included painful swollen lumps in the groin, armpits, or neck (called <dfn class="term" data-def="Large, painful swellings of the lymph nodes caused by bubonic plague, typically appearing in the groin, armpits, or neck.">buboes</dfn>), high fever, headaches, vomiting, and a rash of dark blotches on the skin. Around 60&ndash;70% of those infected died, usually within a week.</li>
            <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A more deadly form of plague that attacked the lungs.">Pneumonic plague</dfn>:</strong> Attacked the lungs and was spread through coughing and sneezing. This form was even more contagious and almost always fatal, often killing within 24&ndash;48 hours. Victims coughed up blood and struggled to breathe.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n25">What Did People Believe Caused It?</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n26">Without knowledge of germs, people desperately searched for explanations:</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_black_death_causes.png" alt="Four things medieval people believed caused the Black Death — God's punishment, miasma (bad air), alignment of planets, and false blame on Jewish communities. The real cause (Yersinia pestis carried by fleas on rats) was unknown until the 1890s.">
        </figure>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n28">Attempted Treatments and Prevention</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n29">People tried many methods to prevent or cure the plague, all based on their mistaken beliefs about its causes:</p>

            <p>An estimated 1.5&ndash;2.5 million people died. Some villages were completely wiped out. Labour became desperately scarce.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n40"><strong>Long-term:</strong> The plague forced people to question why traditional remedies and prayer had failed.

              <p>When plague returned to London in 1665 &mdash; over <strong>300 years</strong> later &mdash; people <strong>still did not know the real cause</strong>. The responses were very similar to 1348, showing how little understanding had changed.</p>
              <p>London authorities issued <strong>&ldquo;Plague Orders&rdquo;</strong> that included a range of measures:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Quarantine of infected houses:</strong> Homes where plague was found were locked shut for 40 days, with a red cross painted on the door and a watchman posted outside to prevent anyone leaving.</li>
                <li><strong>Killing stray dogs and cats:</strong> Authorities ordered the slaughter of stray animals, ironically removing some of the very creatures that killed the rats carrying the disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Banning large gatherings:</strong> Public events and meetings were restricted to limit the spread of infection.</li>
                <li><strong>Burning infected clothes and bedding:</strong> Belongings of plague victims were destroyed in an attempt to stop the disease spreading.</li>
                <li><strong>Women &ldquo;searchers&rdquo;:</strong> Women were paid to examine the sick and the dead, identifying plague cases so that households could be quarantined.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The Great Plague of 1665 killed about <strong>100,000 people in London</strong> &mdash; roughly a quarter of the city. Three centuries apart, the two outbreaks show a striking pattern: without understanding <dfn class="term" data-def="The bacterium responsible for plague.">Yersinia pestis</dfn> and how it spread, people relied on the same measures &mdash; quarantine, prayer, and trying to purify the air.</p>

        <p>Don&rsquo;t describe medieval towns as completely filthy with no rules. For top marks, show <strong>nuance</strong>: acknowledge the serious problems, but give specific examples of attempts to improve &mdash; gong farmers, fines, conduits. When writing about the Black Death, don&rsquo;t just list the horrors &mdash; explain <em>why</em> people responded the way they did, linking responses to their beliefs about what caused disease.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n43">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Medieval towns were unhealthy due to contaminated water, street waste, and overcrowding &mdash; but not completely lawless. Efforts like muck-rakers and fines show people did try. Monasteries proved better public health was possible with resources and organisation. The Black Death of 1348 was a turning point &mdash; its catastrophic death toll exposed the limits of existing medical knowledge and began to weaken trust in traditional remedies and Church authority.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Medieval towns had serious public health problems:</strong> Contaminated water, street waste, overcrowding, and miasma theory all contributed. But councils did try to improve conditions &mdash; showing this balance matters for top marks.</li>
          <li><strong>The Black Death killed one-third to one-half of England&rsquo;s population:</strong> Arriving in 1348, people blamed God, miasma, planets, and minority groups. Only quarantine had any real effect.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term consequences were significant:</strong> The plague weakened the feudal system, damaged Church authority, and encouraged people to question traditional medicine &mdash; laying groundwork for the Renaissance.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of aspects of significance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining the relationship between aspects of significance, for example over time.\nExample: The Black Death was significant both in its immediate impact and its long-term consequences for medicine. In the short term, it killed between one-third and one-half of England\u2019s population (1348\u20131350), overwhelming all existing medical responses. Treatments based on the Four Humours (bloodletting, purging) were completely useless, and religious responses like flagellation and prayer also failed. Over time, this was highly significant because the failure of both rational and supernatural medicine planted seeds of doubt. The Church\u2019s authority weakened when prayer failed to stop the plague, contributing to a gradual shift towards questioning traditional ideas. The development of quarantine during plague outbreaks was one of the first practical public health measures and became a lasting approach to epidemic control. The Black Death was therefore a turning point that began \u2014 very slowly \u2014 to undermine medieval medical orthodoxy.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of aspects of significance. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more aspects of significance.\nExample: The Black Death was significant because it exposed the limits of medieval medicine. Treatments based on the Four Humours, such as bloodletting and purging, were completely ineffective against plague. It was also significant for the Church\u2019s authority: people had relied on prayer and pilgrimage, but these failed to stop the plague, weakening trust in religious explanations of disease.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of significance. Students progress from basic explanation by simple reasoning of one identified aspect.\nExample: The Black Death was significant because it killed so many people that it created a labour shortage. Surviving peasants could demand higher wages, weakening the feudal system.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of significance. Students identify aspect(s) relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The Black Death was significant because it killed a lot of people in 1348.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of similarities. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining complexities of similarities arising from the broader historical context.\nExample: Both the Black Death (1348) and cholera epidemics (1831 onwards) overwhelmed existing medical knowledge and prompted similar types of response, even though they were separated by 500 years. In both cases, people did not understand the true cause of the disease and blamed miasma (\u2018bad air\u2019) \u2014 medieval people carried posies and herbs, while 19th-century authorities tried to clean up foul-smelling areas. Both also triggered government action on public health: the Black Death led to early quarantine measures and the Statute of Labourers (1351), while cholera led to the Public Health Acts of 1848 and 1875 and Bazalgette\u2019s London sewer system. This similarity shows that epidemic disease has repeatedly been the catalyst for public health reform \u2014 governments only act decisively when death tolls force their hand.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of similarities. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more identified similarities.\nExample: Both plagues caused panic and blame. During the Black Death, people blamed God, miasma, and Jewish communities. During cholera epidemics, people blamed miasma and poor moral character. Both also prompted quarantine measures: in 1348 some towns boarded up infected houses, and in the 19th century cholera patients were isolated and infected areas were restricted.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one similarity. Students progress from basic explanation by reasoning supported with factual knowledge.\nExample: Both the Black Death and cholera epidemics were blamed on miasma (\u2018bad air\u2019). During the Black Death, people carried posies and herbs. During cholera outbreaks, authorities tried to clean up smells, not realising the real cause was contaminated water.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of similarity/similarities. Students identify similarity/similarities relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Both diseases killed lots of people and nobody knew what really caused them.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of similarities. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining complexities of similarities arising from the broader historical context.\nExample: Both the Black Death and cholera caused mass panic and triggered similar responses despite being separated by five centuries, revealing how slowly understanding of epidemic disease changed. In both cases, people believed miasma caused the disease: medieval people carried herbs and posies, while 19th-century reformers like Edwin Chadwick focused on removing foul smells rather than targeting the true cause. In both cases, governments were forced to take unprecedented public health action. The Black Death led to quarantine measures (boarding up infected houses) and the 1388 law fining people \u00a320 for dumping waste in rivers. Cholera led to the Public Health Acts (1848, 1875) and John Snow\u2019s discovery that contaminated water spread the disease (1854). Both epidemics were therefore significant catalysts for public health reform, even when the science was wrong.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of similarities. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more identified similarities.\nExample: Both the Black Death and cholera led to government action on public health. During the Black Death, some towns quarantined infected houses and parliament passed laws about waste disposal. During cholera, the government passed the Public Health Acts and built new sewer systems. Both also saw people blaming miasma \u2014 bad smells \u2014 for the disease, rather than understanding the real cause.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one similarity.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Government was not the main factor in the medieval period \u2014 town councils tried measures like fines, muck-rakers, and gong farmers, but they lacked the power and money to make a significant difference. King Edward I ordered public toilets in York (1298) and parliament banned dumping waste in rivers (1388), but enforcement was weak. However, from the 19th century onwards, government became the dominant factor. The 1848 Public Health Act (after Chadwick\u2019s report) was the first national attempt to improve sanitation, and the 1875 Public Health Act made clean water, sewage systems, and rubbish collection compulsory. Bazalgette\u2019s London sewer system was government-funded. In the 20th century, the Liberal welfare reforms (1906\u20131914) and the creation of the NHS (1948) showed government taking full responsibility for public health. However, government action often depended on other factors: epidemics like the Black Death and cholera forced action, and scientific discoveries like germ theory gave governments the knowledge to act effectively.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Government became more important over time. In the medieval period, councils tried fines and muck-rakers but had limited power. By the 19th century, the government passed the Public Health Acts (1848, 1875) making clean water and sewage compulsory. The NHS (1948) provided free healthcare for everyone.\nExample (other factor): Epidemic disease also drove change. The Black Death killed one-third to one-half of the population, forcing quarantine measures. Cholera epidemics in the 19th century led directly to the Public Health Acts. Without these crises, governments might not have acted.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Government was important because medieval town councils tried to improve public health by hiring muck-rakers and fining people for dumping waste. But they did not have enough power to make a big difference.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: The government passed laws to try to improve public health.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."

Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Religion had a mixed impact on public health in the medieval period but became less important over time. Monasteries had the best public health in medieval Britain \u2014 piped water, latrines, and separation of clean water from waste \u2014 showing that religious discipline and resources could achieve excellent sanitation. However, the Church\u2019s teaching that disease was God\u2019s punishment discouraged practical public health measures in towns. The Black Death (1348) weakened the Church\u2019s authority when prayer failed to stop the plague, beginning a slow shift towards secular solutions. By the 19th century, religion was no longer the main factor. Chadwick\u2019s 1842 report, John Snow\u2019s cholera investigation (1854), and Bazalgette\u2019s sewer system were driven by science and government action, not religion. The NHS (1948) and modern public health are entirely secular. Religion was influential in one period but was superseded by science and government as the main factors.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Religion influenced medieval public health. Monasteries had excellent sanitation with piped water and latrines, far ahead of towns. But the Church also taught that disease was God\u2019s punishment, meaning people relied on prayer rather than practical public health measures. During the Black Death, flagellants whipped themselves to beg God\u2019s mercy.\nExample (other factor): Science and technology became more important later. Pasteur\u2019s germ theory (1861) explained how disease actually spread. This enabled John Snow\u2019s work on cholera and led to the Public Health Acts. Modern public health depends entirely on scientific understanding, not religious belief.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Religion affected public health because monasteries had the best sanitation in medieval Britain. Monks had piped water, latrines, and clean living conditions because their religious rules required regular washing and hygiene.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Religion was important because the Church ran monasteries which were very clean.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.

Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Science and technology was not the main factor in medieval public health because the necessary scientific knowledge simply did not exist. Without germ theory, people believed miasma caused disease and could not target the real causes. Town councils tried practical measures (muck-rakers, gong farmers, fines, conduits like London\u2019s Great Conduit of 1236), but these were based on wrong ideas about disease. However, from the 19th century onwards, science became the dominant factor. Pasteur\u2019s germ theory (1861) transformed understanding of how disease spread. This enabled John Snow\u2019s cholera investigation, Bazalgette\u2019s sewer system, and the compulsory Public Health Act of 1875. In the modern period, scientific understanding drives vaccination programmes, water treatment, and food safety regulations. Yet science alone was not enough: it required government action to implement public health measures and epidemic crises (the Black Death, cholera) to force change. Science provided the knowledge, but government provided the power and epidemics provided the motivation.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Science and technology became crucial from the 19th century. Pasteur\u2019s germ theory (1861) showed that microorganisms caused disease. This led to clean water campaigns, new sewage systems, and the Public Health Act of 1875. Modern public health relies entirely on scientific understanding for vaccination, water treatment, and disease prevention.\nExample (other factor): Government was also essential. Even after germ theory was proven, it took government action to implement changes. The 1875 Public Health Act made clean water and sewage disposal compulsory. The NHS (1948) made healthcare free and universal. Without government enforcement, scientific knowledge alone would not have improved public health.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Science and technology was not the main factor in the medieval period because people did not understand germs. They believed bad smells (miasma) caused disease, so they carried herbs and flowers rather than tackling the real causes.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Science helped public health because germ theory showed what caused disease.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.
