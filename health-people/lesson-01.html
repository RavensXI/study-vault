        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Introduction: How Did People Explain Disease?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">For most of history, nobody understood what caused disease. Without microscopes or modern science, doctors relied on observation, philosophy, and religion to explain illness. The ideas they came up with &mdash; from the <dfn class="term" data-def="A theory developed by Hippocrates suggesting that the body contained four key fluids (blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm) that needed to remain balanced for good health.">Four Humours</dfn> to supernatural explanations &mdash; dominated medicine for over a thousand years.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">This lesson covers the key ideas about disease in the ancient and medieval periods: the work of <strong>Hippocrates</strong> and <strong>Galen</strong>, <strong>supernatural beliefs</strong>, and the role of <strong>astrology</strong> in diagnosis.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Hippocrates &amp; the Theory of the Four Humours</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5"><dfn class="term" data-def="An Ancient Greek physician (c.460&ndash;370 BC) known as the &lsquo;Father of Medicine.&rsquo; He rejected supernatural explanations for disease, promoted clinical observation, and developed the Theory of the Four Humours.">Hippocrates</dfn> (c.460&ndash;370 BC) was an Ancient Greek physician often called the &ldquo;Father of Medicine.&rdquo; Before him, most Greeks believed illness was a punishment from the gods. Hippocrates argued that disease had <strong>natural causes</strong> and looked for physical explanations instead.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n6">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Four Humours</div>
          <p>Hippocrates believed the body contained four main fluids, or &ldquo;humours&rdquo;:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Blood</strong> &mdash; linked to spring, air, and a hot &amp; wet nature</li>
            <li><strong>Yellow Bile</strong> &mdash; linked to summer, fire, and a hot &amp; dry nature</li>
            <li><strong>Black Bile</strong> &mdash; linked to autumn, earth, and a cold &amp; dry nature</li>
            <li><strong>Phlegm</strong> &mdash; linked to winter, water, and a cold &amp; wet nature</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If these humours were <strong>perfectly balanced</strong>, the person was healthy. If one became too dominant, they fell ill.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">Hippocrates&rsquo; Approach: Clinical Observation</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">Hippocrates also promoted <dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of carefully watching and recording a patient&rsquo;s symptoms over time to identify patterns and predict the course of an illness.">clinical observation</dfn> &mdash; carefully watching patients, recording symptoms, and tracking how illness progressed. This pushed doctors towards evidence and reason rather than prayers or rituals.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">He compiled medical texts known as the <dfn class="term" data-def="A collection of around 60 medical texts written by Hippocrates and his followers.">Hippocratic Corpus</dfn>, covering diagnosis, treatment, surgery, and the role of diet and exercise. These texts were studied for centuries and became the foundation of Western medical training.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n10">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Hippocratic Oath</div>
          <p>The <dfn class="term" data-def="An ethical oath traditionally taken by doctors, attributed to Hippocrates.">Hippocratic Oath</dfn> is a set of ethical rules for doctors attributed to Hippocrates. It included promises to treat patients to the best of one&rsquo;s ability, do no harm, and keep patient information private. Versions of this oath are still used by doctors today.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n11">Galen &amp; the Theory of Opposites</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n12"><dfn class="term" data-def="A Roman physician of Greek origin (c.129&ndash;216 AD) who built on Hippocrates&rsquo; work.">Galen</dfn> (c.129&ndash;216 AD) was a Roman physician of Greek origin. He studied anatomy in Egypt by examining dead bodies and bones, then spent <strong>15 years as a doctor at a gladiator school</strong> &mdash; giving him rare hands-on experience of injuries and wound treatment. He built on Hippocrates&rsquo; ideas by developing the <dfn class="term" data-def="Galen&rsquo;s idea that illnesses caused by an excess of one humour could be treated by giving the patient the &lsquo;opposite&rsquo; quality.">Theory of Opposites</dfn>: if a patient had too much of one humour, treat them with the &ldquo;opposite&rdquo; quality to restore balance.</p>

        <p>Galen also proved that the <strong>brain, not the heart, controlled the body</strong> by cutting a pig&rsquo;s spinal cord at different points. However, because he dissected animals rather than humans, many of his anatomical observations contained errors that went unchallenged for centuries.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n13">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Theory of Opposites in Practice</div>
          <p>A fever (too much blood &mdash; hot &amp; wet) would be treated with something cold or dry. A cold (too much phlegm &mdash; cold &amp; wet) would be treated with pepper or hot spices. This gave doctors a logical system for choosing treatments, even though the theory itself was wrong.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Treating Each Humour</div>
          <p>Each humour had a specific treatment designed to remove or reduce it when in excess:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Too much blood</strong> &rarr; <dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of deliberately removing blood from a patient, either by cutting a vein (venesection), applying leeches, or using heated cups (cupping).">bleeding</dfn> (using cups or leeches to draw blood out)</li>
            <li><strong>Too much yellow bile</strong> &rarr; vomiting, induced by giving the patient <dfn class="term" data-def="Substances that induce vomiting, used by doctors to remove excess humours from the body.">emetics</dfn></li>
            <li><strong>Too much black bile</strong> &rarr; purging, using <dfn class="term" data-def="Substances that stimulate bowel movements, used by doctors to purge excess humours from the body.">laxatives</dfn> to empty the bowels</li>
            <li><strong>Too much phlegm</strong> &rarr; warming and sweating the patient to dry out the excess moisture</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n14">Why Did Galen&rsquo;s Ideas Last So Long?</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">Galen&rsquo;s ideas dominated European medicine for over <strong>1,500 years</strong>. Why did they last so long?</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n16"><strong>Volume of writing:</strong> Galen produced over <strong>350 books</strong> on anatomy, disease, and treatment. His work became the standard reference across Europe and the Islamic world.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n17"><strong>Church support:</strong> Galen believed the body was perfectly designed, which fitted the Christian belief that God created humans. The Church promoted his work &mdash; challenging Galen meant challenging the Church.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n18"><strong>No way to check:</strong> The Church banned human dissection for much of the medieval period, so nobody could test whether Galen&rsquo;s descriptions were correct. Many were based on animal dissections and contained serious errors.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n19"><strong>Collapse of the Roman Empire:</strong> After Rome fell in <strong>410 AD</strong>, much knowledge was lost.

        <h2 data-narration-id="n20">Supernatural Beliefs About Disease</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">Although Hippocrates and Galen promoted natural explanations, <strong>supernatural beliefs</strong> remained very common throughout the medieval period. For most ordinary people &mdash; and for the Church &mdash; disease was linked to religion.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n22">God&rsquo;s Punishment</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">The most common supernatural explanation was that disease was a <strong>punishment from God</strong> for sinful behaviour. The Bible described God sending plagues to punish the wicked, and medieval people took this literally. If someone fell ill, it was often assumed they had angered God.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">If disease came from God, the logical cure was a <strong>religious one</strong>: prayer, repentance, fasting, <dfn class="term" data-def="A journey to a holy place, such as a church, shrine, or religious site, undertaken as an act of devotion or to seek healing.">pilgrimage</dfn>, or donating to the Church. Sick people visited holy shrines, prayed to healing saints, or touched sacred <dfn class="term" data-def="Physical remains of a saint (such as bones or clothing) that medieval people believed had miraculous healing powers.">relics</dfn> hoping to be cured.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n25">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Because people believed God sent disease, the Church played a central role in healthcare. Priests were often consulted before doctors, and prayer and pilgrimage were among the most common &ldquo;treatments.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n26">The Role of Astrology in Diagnosis</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n27"><dfn class="term" data-def="The study of the positions and movements of stars and planets, which medieval people believed could influence human health, personality, and the success of medical treatments.">Astrology</dfn> played a major role in medieval medicine. Physicians consulted <dfn class="term" data-def="Charts showing the positions of stars and planets at a particular time, used by medieval doctors to decide when to perform treatments such as bloodletting.">zodiac charts</dfn> to diagnose illness and decide when to treat patients, believing the stars and planets could affect the balance of humours.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n28">Different <dfn class="term" data-def="The twelve divisions of the celestial sphere used in astrology, each associated with different parts of the body.">zodiac signs</dfn> were linked to different body parts &mdash; Aries to the head, Pisces to the feet.

        <p>When writing about the Four Humours, link it to bigger themes: <strong>observation vs. religion</strong>, why ideas stayed the same for so long (Church support, no technology, respect for ancients), and how the <strong>Renaissance</strong> later challenged them. Examiners reward answers that show <em>continuity and change</em>.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Four Humours was one of the earliest attempts to explain how the body works. Although it was wrong, it was a key shift towards natural &mdash; rather than supernatural &mdash; explanations for disease. Yet supernatural beliefs stayed central to everyday medicine throughout the medieval period.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hippocrates introduced natural explanations:</strong> The Four Humours said illness came from imbalanced bodily fluids, not the gods. His focus on clinical observation laid the groundwork for evidence-based medicine.</li>
          <li><strong>Galen dominated for 1,500+ years:</strong> Church support, dissection bans, and the sheer volume of his writing made his ideas almost impossible to challenge &mdash; even the errors.</li>
          <li><strong>Supernatural beliefs coexisted with rational medicine:</strong> Even educated doctors used astrology alongside the Four Humours. For most people, prayer and pilgrimage came first. This mix of rational and supernatural thinking is key for the exam.</li>

Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining the relationship between aspects of significance, for example over time.\nExample: Medieval treatments such as bloodletting, purging, and herbal remedies were significant because they were all based on the Theory of the Four Humours. This meant that for over 1,000 years, the approach to treating illness did not fundamentally change \u2014 doctors continued to try to rebalance the humours rather than targeting the actual cause of disease. The significance extends over time because Galen\u2019s Theory of Opposites gave these treatments a logical framework that the Church endorsed, making them almost impossible to challenge until the Renaissance.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of aspects of significance. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more aspects of significance.\nExample: Bloodletting was significant because it was the most common treatment for nearly every condition, using methods like venesection, leeches, and cupping. Herbal remedies were also significant because some, like willow bark (containing salicin, related to aspirin) and honey (a natural antiseptic), had genuine medical value \u2014 showing that medieval medicine was not entirely useless.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of significance. Students progress from basic explanation by simple reasoning of one identified aspect.\nExample: Bloodletting was significant because it was based on the idea that excess blood caused illness. Doctors used leeches or cut veins to remove blood and try to restore the balance of humours.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of significance.

Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining the relationship between aspects of significance, for example over time.\nExample: Hippocrates was significant both in his own time and over the long term. His Theory of the Four Humours was the first attempt to explain disease through natural causes rather than supernatural ones, marking a fundamental shift from divine punishment to physical imbalance. Over time, this was significant because it became the basis of all Western medicine for over 1,500 years. His promotion of clinical observation \u2014 carefully watching and recording symptoms \u2014 laid the groundwork for evidence-based medicine, an approach still central to medical practice today. The Hippocratic Oath set ethical standards that doctors still follow.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of aspects of significance. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more aspects of significance.\nExample: Hippocrates was significant because he rejected the idea that the gods caused disease, instead arguing illness had natural causes linked to the four humours (blood, yellow bile, black bile, phlegm). He also promoted clinical observation, recording symptoms to track how illness progressed, which was a scientific approach for its time.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of significance. Students progress from basic explanation by simple reasoning of one identified aspect.\nExample: Hippocrates was significant because he developed the Theory of the Four Humours, which said illness was caused by an imbalance in the body\u2019s fluids rather than by the gods.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of significance.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of similarities. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining complexities of similarities arising from the broader historical context.\nExample: Both periods relied on the Theory of the Four Humours as the main natural explanation for disease, and both also used supernatural explanations alongside it. This continuity existed because Galen\u2019s writings (building on Hippocrates) were promoted by the Christian Church, which controlled education and banned challenges to accepted ideas. The lack of technology such as microscopes meant neither period could identify the real causes of disease, so the same theories persisted for over 1,500 years.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of similarities. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more identified similarities.\nExample: In both periods, the Theory of the Four Humours was the main explanation for disease. Ancient Greek physicians like Hippocrates argued that illness was caused by an imbalance in blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm, and medieval doctors still used the same theory over 1,000 years later, diagnosing patients using urine charts. Both periods also relied on supernatural explanations: the Greeks blamed the gods, while medieval people believed God sent disease as punishment for sin.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one similarity. Students progress from basic explanation by reasoning supported with factual knowledge.\nExample: Both periods believed in the Theory of the Four Humours. In Ancient Greece, Hippocrates said disease was caused by an imbalance of the four fluids, and medieval doctors still used this idea to diagnose illness.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of similarity/similarities. Students identify similarity/similarities relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Both periods believed illness was caused by the four humours.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        text: "Has religion been the main factor in the development of medicine in Britain since Medieval times? Explain your answer with reference to religion and other factors. Use a range of examples from across your study of Health and the people: c1000 to the present day.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Religion was the most important factor in the medieval period because the Church controlled education, promoted Galen\u2019s ideas as they fitted the belief that God designed the body, and banned dissection. This prevented progress for centuries. However, over the full time period, science and technology became the dominant factor. Pasteur\u2019s germ theory (1861) only became possible through microscope technology, and modern breakthroughs like DNA sequencing and keyhole surgery depend entirely on technology. Religion\u2019s role shifted from hindrance to irrelevance as science took over. The Islamic world shows religion could also help \u2014 the Quran encouraged seeking cures, funding hospitals and scholars like Ibn Sina.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Religion hindered medieval medicine because the Church promoted Galen and banned dissection. People believed disease was God\u2019s punishment, so they prayed and went on pilgrimages rather than seeking scientific cures. Roger Bacon was imprisoned for suggesting doctors should experiment.\nExample (other factor): Science and technology became more important from the Renaissance onwards. Vesalius used dissection to prove Galen wrong in over 300 places (1543), Harvey proved blood circulated (1628), and Pasteur\u2019s germ theory (1861) finally explained the true cause of disease. The printing press helped spread these ideas across Europe.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Religion hindered medicine because the Church said disease was God\u2019s punishment and promoted prayer instead of scientific treatments. They supported Galen\u2019s ideas and banned dissection.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: The Church was important because it ran hospitals and told people to pray when they were ill.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."

Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Science and technology has been the most important factor overall because every major breakthrough depended on it. Without microscopes, Pasteur could not have developed germ theory (1861). Without the printing press, Vesalius\u2019s corrections of Galen (1543) could not have spread across Europe. Without X-rays and blood transfusion technology, WWI surgery would not have advanced. However, technology alone was not enough \u2014 it required individuals with the courage to challenge accepted ideas (Vesalius, Harvey) and sometimes chance played a role (Par\u00e9 running out of oil, Fleming discovering penicillin). In the medieval period, the lack of technology (no microscopes) was the main reason the Four Humours persisted for over 1,500 years.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Science and technology drove major breakthroughs. The microscope allowed Pasteur to see microorganisms and develop germ theory. The printing press allowed Vesalius\u2019s anatomy book to spread across Europe. Modern technology like MRI scanners and robotic surgery have transformed diagnosis and treatment.\nExample (other factor): Individuals were also important. Hippocrates developed the Theory of the Four Humours through clinical observation. Galen wrote over 350 books that dominated medicine for 1,500 years. Harvey used experiments to prove blood circulation in 1628. Without these individuals pushing boundaries, technology alone would not have advanced medicine.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Science and technology was important because the microscope allowed scientists to see germs for the first time, which led to Pasteur\u2019s germ theory and eventually to vaccines and antibiotics.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Technology like microscopes helped doctors understand disease better.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.

Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Individuals were crucial at every stage, but they could only succeed when other factors aligned. Hippocrates developed the Four Humours through clinical observation, and Galen\u2019s 350+ books dominated medicine for 1,500 years because the Church promoted them. In the Renaissance, Vesalius corrected over 300 of Galen\u2019s errors through human dissection (1543), but his impact depended on the printing press to spread his work. Harvey proved circulation (1628) through experiments, but practical benefits only came centuries later when blood transfusion technology existed. Pasteur\u2019s germ theory (1861) needed the microscope, and Fleming\u2019s penicillin discovery (1928) needed government funding during WWII for mass production. So individuals were essential, but they operated within a web of enabling factors.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Individuals drove key breakthroughs across all periods. Hippocrates developed the Four Humours and clinical observation. Galen built on this with the Theory of Opposites and wrote over 350 books. Vesalius proved Galen wrong through dissection. Harvey proved blood circulates. Each individual moved understanding forward.\nExample (other factor): However, religion slowed progress for centuries. The Church promoted Galen, banned dissection, and taught that disease was God\u2019s punishment. Even brilliant individuals like Roger Bacon were imprisoned for challenging Church teaching. Without the Church\u2019s grip loosening during the Renaissance, individuals could not have made their breakthroughs.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Individuals were important because Hippocrates developed the Theory of the Four Humours, which explained disease as a natural imbalance rather than a punishment from the gods. This was a major step forward in how people understood illness.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors.
