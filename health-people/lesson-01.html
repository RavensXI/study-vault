        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Introduction: How Did People Explain Disease?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">For most of history, nobody understood what caused disease. Without microscopes or modern science, doctors relied on observation, philosophy, and religion to explain illness. The ideas they came up with &mdash; from the <dfn class="term" data-def="A theory developed by Hippocrates suggesting that the body contained four key fluids (blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm) that needed to remain balanced for good health.">Four Humours</dfn> to supernatural explanations &mdash; dominated medicine for over a thousand years.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">This lesson covers the key ideas about disease in the ancient and medieval periods: the work of <strong>Hippocrates</strong> and <strong>Galen</strong>, <strong>supernatural beliefs</strong>, and the role of <strong>astrology</strong> in diagnosis.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Hippocrates &amp; the Theory of the Four Humours</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5"><dfn class="term" data-def="An Ancient Greek physician (c.460&ndash;370 BC) known as the &lsquo;Father of Medicine.&rsquo; He rejected supernatural explanations for disease, promoted clinical observation, and developed the Theory of the Four Humours.">Hippocrates</dfn> (c.460&ndash;370 BC) was an Ancient Greek physician often called the &ldquo;Father of Medicine.&rdquo; Before him, most Greeks believed illness was a punishment from the gods. Hippocrates argued that disease had <strong>natural causes</strong> and looked for physical explanations instead.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n6">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Four Humours</div>
          <p>Hippocrates believed the body contained four main fluids, or &ldquo;humours&rdquo;:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Blood</strong> &mdash; linked to spring, air, and a hot &amp; wet nature</li>
            <li><strong>Yellow Bile</strong> &mdash; linked to summer, fire, and a hot &amp; dry nature</li>
            <li><strong>Black Bile</strong> &mdash; linked to autumn, earth, and a cold &amp; dry nature</li>
            <li><strong>Phlegm</strong> &mdash; linked to winter, water, and a cold &amp; wet nature</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If these humours were <strong>perfectly balanced</strong>, the person was healthy. If one became too dominant, they fell ill.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">Hippocrates&rsquo; Approach: Clinical Observation</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">Hippocrates also promoted <dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of carefully watching and recording a patient&rsquo;s symptoms over time to identify patterns and predict the course of an illness. Hippocrates pioneered this method.">clinical observation</dfn> &mdash; carefully watching patients, recording symptoms, and tracking how illness progressed. This pushed doctors towards evidence and reason rather than prayers or rituals.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">He compiled medical texts known as the <dfn class="term" data-def="A collection of around 60 medical texts written by Hippocrates and his followers. They covered topics including diagnosis, treatment, surgery, and the importance of diet and exercise.">Hippocratic Corpus</dfn>, covering diagnosis, treatment, surgery, and the role of diet and exercise. These texts were studied for centuries and became the foundation of Western medical training.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n10">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Hippocratic Oath</div>
          <p>The <dfn class="term" data-def="An ethical oath traditionally taken by doctors, attributed to Hippocrates. It set out rules of conduct including treating patients to the best of one&rsquo;s ability and keeping patient information confidential.">Hippocratic Oath</dfn> is a set of ethical rules for doctors attributed to Hippocrates. It included promises to treat patients to the best of one&rsquo;s ability, do no harm, and keep patient information private. Versions of this oath are still used by doctors today.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n11">Galen &amp; the Theory of Opposites</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n12"><dfn class="term" data-def="A Roman physician of Greek origin (c.129&ndash;216 AD) who built on Hippocrates&rsquo; work. He developed the Theory of Opposites, promoted the use of dissection, and wrote extensively about anatomy and medicine. His ideas dominated European medicine for over 1,500 years.">Galen</dfn> (c.129&ndash;216 AD) was a Roman physician of Greek origin. He studied anatomy in Egypt by examining dead bodies and bones, then spent <strong>15 years as a doctor at a gladiator school</strong> &mdash; giving him rare hands-on experience of injuries and wound treatment. He built on Hippocrates&rsquo; ideas by developing the <dfn class="term" data-def="Galen&rsquo;s idea that illnesses caused by an excess of one humour could be treated by giving the patient the &lsquo;opposite&rsquo; quality. For example, a fever (too much blood, hot &amp; wet) would be treated with something cold or dry, such as a cucumber.">Theory of Opposites</dfn>: if a patient had too much of one humour, treat them with the &ldquo;opposite&rdquo; quality to restore balance.</p>

        <p>Galen also proved that the <strong>brain, not the heart, controlled the body</strong> by cutting a pig&rsquo;s spinal cord at different points. However, because he dissected animals rather than humans, many of his anatomical observations contained errors that went unchallenged for centuries.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n13">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Theory of Opposites in Practice</div>
          <p>A fever (too much blood &mdash; hot &amp; wet) would be treated with something cold or dry. A cold (too much phlegm &mdash; cold &amp; wet) would be treated with pepper or hot spices. This gave doctors a logical system for choosing treatments, even though the theory itself was wrong.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Treating Each Humour</div>
          <p>Each humour had a specific treatment designed to remove or reduce it when in excess:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Too much blood</strong> &rarr; <dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of deliberately removing blood from a patient, either by cutting a vein (venesection), applying leeches, or using heated cups (cupping). It was the most common medieval treatment, believed to remove excess blood and restore the balance of humours.">bleeding</dfn> (using cups or leeches to draw blood out)</li>
            <li><strong>Too much yellow bile</strong> &rarr; vomiting, induced by giving the patient <dfn class="term" data-def="Substances that induce vomiting, used by doctors to remove excess humours from the body.">emetics</dfn></li>
            <li><strong>Too much black bile</strong> &rarr; purging, using <dfn class="term" data-def="Substances that stimulate bowel movements, used by doctors to purge excess humours from the body.">laxatives</dfn> to empty the bowels</li>
            <li><strong>Too much phlegm</strong> &rarr; warming and sweating the patient to dry out the excess moisture</li>
          </ul>

              <p data-narration-id="n18"><strong>No way to check:</strong> The Church banned human dissection for much of the medieval period, so nobody could test whether Galen&rsquo;s descriptions were correct. Many were based on animal dissections and contained serious errors.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n19"><strong>Collapse of the Roman Empire:</strong> After Rome fell in <strong>410 AD</strong>, much knowledge was lost.

        <h2 data-narration-id="n20">Supernatural Beliefs About Disease</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">Although Hippocrates and Galen promoted natural explanations, <strong>supernatural beliefs</strong> remained very common throughout the medieval period. For most ordinary people &mdash; and for the Church &mdash; disease was linked to religion.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n22">God&rsquo;s Punishment</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">The most common supernatural explanation was that disease was a <strong>punishment from God</strong> for sinful behaviour. The Bible described God sending plagues to punish the wicked, and medieval people took this literally. If someone fell ill, it was often assumed they had angered God.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">If disease came from God, the logical cure was a <strong>religious one</strong>: prayer, repentance, fasting, <dfn class="term" data-def="A journey to a holy place, such as a church, shrine, or religious site, undertaken as an act of devotion or to seek healing. Medieval people believed that visiting sacred relics could cure illness.">pilgrimage</dfn>, or donating to the Church. Sick people visited holy shrines, prayed to healing saints, or touched sacred <dfn class="term" data-def="Physical remains of a saint (such as bones or clothing) that medieval people believed had miraculous healing powers.">relics</dfn> hoping to be cured.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n25">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Because people believed God sent disease, the Church played a central role in healthcare. Priests were often consulted before doctors, and prayer and pilgrimage were among the most common &ldquo;treatments.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n26">The Role of Astrology in Diagnosis</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n27"><dfn class="term" data-def="The study of the positions and movements of stars and planets, which medieval people believed could influence human health, personality, and the success of medical treatments.">Astrology</dfn> played a major role in medieval medicine. Physicians consulted <dfn class="term" data-def="Charts showing the positions of stars and planets at a particular time, used by medieval doctors to decide when to perform treatments such as bloodletting.">zodiac charts</dfn> to diagnose illness and decide when to treat patients, believing the stars and planets could affect the balance of humours.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n28">Different <dfn class="term" data-def="The twelve divisions of the celestial sphere used in astrology, each associated with different parts of the body. Medieval doctors believed the position of the sun, moon, and planets in these signs affected health.">zodiac signs</dfn> were linked to different body parts &mdash; Aries to the head, Pisces to the feet. A doctor might refuse to perform <dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of deliberately cutting a vein or applying leeches to remove blood from a patient, believed to rebalance the humours. It was one of the most common medical treatments for over 2,000 years.">bloodletting</dfn> if the stars were not in a favourable position.

        <p>When writing about the Four Humours, link it to bigger themes: <strong>observation vs. religion</strong>, why ideas stayed the same for so long (Church support, no technology, respect for ancients), and how the <strong>Renaissance</strong> later challenged them.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Four Humours was one of the earliest attempts to explain how the body works. Although it was wrong, it was a key shift towards natural &mdash; rather than supernatural &mdash; explanations for disease. Yet supernatural beliefs stayed central to everyday medicine throughout the medieval period.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hippocrates introduced natural explanations:</strong> The Four Humours said illness came from imbalanced bodily fluids, not the gods. His focus on clinical observation laid the groundwork for evidence-based medicine.</li>
          <li><strong>Galen dominated for 1,500+ years:</strong> Church support, dissection bans, and the sheer volume of his writing made his ideas almost impossible to challenge &mdash; even the errors.</li>
          <li><strong>Supernatural beliefs coexisted with rational medicine:</strong> Even educated doctors used astrology alongside the Four Humours. For most people, prayer and pilgrimage came first. This mix of rational and supernatural thinking is key for the exam.</li>
