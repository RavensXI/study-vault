        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Introduction: A Time of Transition</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The 18th century was a fascinating period for medicine in Britain. While Vesalius, Par&eacute;, and Harvey had made important breakthroughs, many of the old ideas about disease and treatment <strong>stubbornly persisted</strong> alongside the new. This lesson examines what stayed the same (<dfn class="term" data-def="Things that stay the same over time. In medicine, continuity refers to old ideas, practices, or beliefs that persisted even as new discoveries were being made.">continuity</dfn>) and what was genuinely new (<dfn class="term" data-def="New developments, ideas, or practices that represent a break from the past. In medicine, change refers to new scientific approaches, institutions, or treatments that replaced older methods.">change</dfn>) in how people understood and treated disease.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">What Stayed the Same (Continuity)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Even though science was becoming more important, many old ideas about what caused disease were still very popular among ordinary people. Understanding these continuities is just as important as understanding the changes.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n5">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Persistent Old Beliefs</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="The theory that disease was caused by 'bad air' or foul-smelling vapours rising from rotting matter, swamps, or sewage. This was widely believed from ancient times until the acceptance of Germ Theory in the late 19th century.">Miasma</dfn></strong> &mdash; the belief that &ldquo;bad air&rdquo; or foul smells caused illness &mdash; was still widely accepted.</li>
            <li>The ancient Greek idea of the <dfn class="term" data-def="An ancient Greek medical theory, developed by Hippocrates and Galen, which claimed the body contained four liquids (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile) that needed to be in balance for good health. Illness was thought to be caused by an imbalance.">Four Humours</dfn> had not disappeared entirely.</li>
            <li>Many people still believed that illness was a <strong>punishment from God</strong>.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">For most ordinary people, treatment was a mixture of traditional, herbal remedies passed down through families. They might visit an <dfn class="term" data-def="A person who prepared and sold medicines and herbal remedies. Apothecaries were the forerunners of modern pharmacists and were often the only medical help available to poorer people.">apothecary</dfn> for potions or even a &ldquo;wise woman&rdquo; for a charm or herbal cure.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">This was also a time of widespread <dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of unqualified or fraudulent people selling fake medicines and promising miracle cures. Quack doctors often had no medical training and their 'treatments' were useless or even dangerous.">quackery</dfn>, where untrained people sold fake medicines, promising miracle cures for everything. There was no regulation to stop them, and desperate people were easy targets for these fraudsters.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n8">What Was New (Change)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">The 18th century was part of the <dfn class="term" data-def="An intellectual movement of the 17th and 18th centuries that emphasised reason, science, and individual rights over tradition and superstition. Thinkers believed that human progress could be achieved through rational enquiry.">Enlightenment</dfn>, a period when science, reason, and new ideas were becoming very important. This spirit of enquiry began to influence medicine in several significant ways.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Key Changes in the 18th Century</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The growth of hospitals:</strong> Before, hospitals were mostly places of &ldquo;care&rdquo; run by the Church. New hospitals were now built with the aim of <strong>curing</strong> patients.</li>
            <li><strong>Doctors trained in hospitals:</strong> Physicians began observing patients in wards, learning through direct experience rather than only from books.</li>
            <li><strong>Free dispensaries:</strong> Set up for the poor, these provided medicine and advice without requiring payment for a doctor&rsquo;s visit.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n11">Case Study: John Hunter (1728&ndash;1793)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n12"><strong>John Hunter</strong> is a key figure who demonstrates the new scientific approach to medicine. Often called the <dfn class="term" data-def="A title given to John Hunter in recognition of his pioneering approach to surgery based on scientific observation, experimentation, and anatomical knowledge rather than tradition.">&ldquo;Father of Scientific Surgery&rdquo;</dfn>, he encouraged a fundamentally new way of thinking about medical practice.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">Instead of just accepting old ideas from books, Hunter taught that surgeons must learn through <strong>observation and experiment</strong>. He was a skilled <dfn class="term" data-def="A scientist who studies the structure of the human body, including its organs, bones, muscles, and other internal parts.">anatomist</dfn> and carried out many dissections to better understand how the human body worked.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n15">He experimented on himself and on animals, studying how diseases progressed and how the body healed. He improved techniques for treating wounds and aneurysms, and his insistence on scientific method helped turn surgery from a simple craft performed by barber-surgeons into a more <strong>respected science</strong>.</p>

        <p>For questions about this period, remember to discuss <strong>both continuity and change</strong>. Examiners want to see that you understand progress was not straightforward &mdash; old beliefs like miasma and the Four Humours persisted even as new scientific ideas were emerging. A balanced answer that covers both sides will score higher marks.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 18th century was a time of transition for medicine in Britain. While new scientific thinking was beginning to take hold &mdash; especially through figures like John Hunter &mdash; the majority of people still relied on old beliefs and traditional remedies. Real, widespread change would not come until the discoveries of the 19th century.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Old beliefs persisted:</strong> Miasma, the Four Humours, and supernatural explanations for disease remained common, alongside quackery and traditional herbal remedies.</li>
          <li><strong>New institutions and ideas emerged:</strong> Hospitals shifted from places of care to places of cure, doctors began training through observation, and free dispensaries helped the poor access medicine.</li>
          <li><strong>John Hunter bridged old and new:</strong> As the &ldquo;Father of Scientific Surgery,&rdquo; Hunter championed observation and experimentation, helping to transform surgery into a respected, evidence-based profession.</li>
