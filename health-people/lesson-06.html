        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Introduction: A Time of Transition</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The 18th century was a time of transition for medicine in Britain. Vesalius, Par&eacute;, and Harvey had made important breakthroughs, but many old ideas about disease and treatment <strong>stubbornly persisted</strong>. This lesson looks at what stayed the same (<dfn class="term" data-def="Things that stay the same over time. In medicine, continuity refers to old ideas, practices, or beliefs that persisted even as new discoveries were being made.">continuity</dfn>) and what was genuinely new (<dfn class="term" data-def="New developments, ideas, or practices that represent a break from the past. In medicine, change refers to new scientific approaches, institutions, or treatments that replaced older methods.">change</dfn>) in how people understood and treated disease.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">What Stayed the Same (Continuity)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Even though science was becoming more important, many old ideas about disease were still popular among ordinary people.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n5">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Persistent Old Beliefs</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="The theory that disease was caused by 'bad air' or foul-smelling vapours rising from rotting matter, swamps, or sewage. This was widely believed from ancient times until the acceptance of Germ Theory in the late 19th century.">Miasma</dfn></strong> &mdash; the belief that &ldquo;bad air&rdquo; or foul smells caused illness &mdash; was still widely accepted.</li>
            <li>The ancient Greek idea of the <dfn class="term" data-def="An ancient Greek medical theory, developed by Hippocrates and Galen, which claimed the body contained four liquids (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile) that needed to be in balance for good health. Illness was thought to be caused by an imbalance.">Four Humours</dfn> had not disappeared entirely.</li>
            <li>Many people still believed that illness was a <strong>punishment from God</strong>.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Medical &ldquo;Marketplace&rdquo;</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">For most people, healthcare in the 1600s&ndash;1700s was like a <strong>marketplace</strong> &mdash; they could choose between different practitioners, none of whom were reliably effective:</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Who Could You Visit for Medical Help?</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="Practitioners who combined haircutting with minor surgery such as tooth-pulling, bloodletting, and treating wounds. They had limited training and were lower in status than physicians.">Barber-surgeons</dfn>:</strong> Poorly trained practitioners who gave haircuts <em>and</em> performed minor operations like tooth-pulling and bloodletting. Surgery was seen as a low-status craft.</li>
            <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A person who prepared and sold medicines and herbal remedies. Apothecaries were the forerunners of modern pharmacists and were often the only medical help available to poorer people.">Apothecaries</dfn>:</strong> Sold medicines and potions, often with little formal training. They were the forerunners of modern pharmacists and often the only medical help for poorer people.</li>
            <li><strong>Wise women:</strong> Used traditional knowledge of herbs and plants, sometimes mixed with superstition. Often the first point of contact for rural communities.</li>
            <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of unqualified or fraudulent people selling fake medicines and promising miracle cures. Quack doctors often had no medical training and their 'treatments' were useless or even dangerous.">Quack doctors</dfn>:</strong> Travelling salesmen who sold fake &ldquo;cure-all&rdquo; medicines. There was no regulation to stop them, and desperate people were easy targets.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">The lack of regulation meant medical treatment was very inconsistent. Wealthy patients could afford physicians, but even physicians often relied on outdated ideas like bloodletting and purging.</p>

        <h3>New Treatments from Overseas</h3>

        <p>As European exploration expanded in the 16th and 17th centuries, new treatments arrived from abroad:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A substance derived from the bark of the cinchona tree in South America. It was effective in treating malaria and was one of the first genuinely useful medicines brought to Europe through overseas exploration.">Quinine</dfn></strong> from South American tree bark was used to treat <dfn class="term" data-def="A dangerous disease spread by mosquito bites, causing recurring fever, chills, and sometimes death. Quinine from cinchona bark proved effective in treating it.">malaria</dfn> and was one of the first genuinely effective imported medicines.</li>
          <li><strong>Opium</strong> was used as a powerful painkiller, though it caused serious addiction.</li>
          <li><strong>Tobacco</strong> was believed to be a cure-all for almost every illness &mdash; a claim since disproved.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supernatural Beliefs Persisted</h3>

        <p>Even as new scientific ideas spread, supernatural beliefs remained widespread. Many people believed in the <dfn class="term" data-def="The belief that the touch of a reigning monarch could cure scrofula (a form of tuberculosis affecting the lymph nodes in the neck). English and French monarchs practised this ceremony for centuries, demonstrating the persistence of supernatural beliefs in medicine.">King&rsquo;s Touch</dfn> &mdash; the idea that the monarch&rsquo;s touch could cure <dfn class="term" data-def="A form of tuberculosis that affects the lymph nodes in the neck, causing swelling. It was also known as the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Evil&rsquo; because of the belief that a royal touch could cure it.">scrofula</dfn> (a form of tuberculosis known as the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Evil&rdquo;). Thousands attended royal ceremonies hoping to be healed. This shows how slowly scientific thinking replaced superstition.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n8">What Was New (Change)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">The 18th century was part of the <dfn class="term" data-def="An intellectual movement of the 17th and 18th centuries that emphasised reason, science, and individual rights over tradition and superstition. Thinkers believed that human progress could be achieved through rational enquiry.">Enlightenment</dfn>, when science and reason were becoming very important. This spirit of enquiry began to influence medicine.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n10">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Key Changes in the 18th Century</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The growth of hospitals:</strong> Before, hospitals were mostly places of &ldquo;care&rdquo; run by the Church. New hospitals were now built with the aim of <strong>curing</strong> patients.</li>
            <li><strong>Doctors trained in hospitals:</strong> Physicians began observing patients in wards, learning through direct experience rather than only from books.</li>
            <li><strong>Free dispensaries:</strong> Set up for the poor, these provided medicine and advice without requiring payment for a doctor&rsquo;s visit.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n11">Case Study: John Hunter (1728&ndash;1793)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n12"><strong>John Hunter</strong> shows the new scientific approach to medicine. Often called the <dfn class="term" data-def="A title given to John Hunter in recognition of his pioneering approach to surgery based on scientific observation, experimentation, and anatomical knowledge rather than tradition.">&ldquo;Father of Scientific Surgery&rdquo;</dfn>, he pushed a new way of thinking about medical practice.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">Instead of accepting old ideas from books, Hunter taught that surgeons must learn through <strong>observation and experiment</strong>. He was a skilled <dfn class="term" data-def="A scientist who studies the structure of the human body, including its organs, bones, muscles, and other internal parts.">anatomist</dfn> who carried out many dissections to understand how the body worked.</p>

        <h3>Hunter&rsquo;s Surgical Innovations</h3>

        <p>One of Hunter&rsquo;s most celebrated achievements was treating a <dfn class="term" data-def="A dangerous swelling of a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the vessel wall. If an aneurysm bursts, it can cause life-threatening internal bleeding. Hunter pioneered a new surgical technique for treating aneurysms behind the knee.">popliteal aneurysm</dfn> &mdash; a dangerously swollen artery behind the knee. The standard treatment was <strong>amputation</strong>, which was brutal and often fatal. Hunter tied off the artery higher up the leg, allowing other blood vessels to expand and keep the leg alive. This showed his approach in action: <strong>observe the problem, hypothesise a solution, test it</strong>.</p>

            <span>Body-snatching and the problem of dissection</span>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p>Getting bodies for dissection was a major problem. Henry VIII had granted surgeons just <strong>4 hanged criminals per year</strong> for anatomical study. As demand grew, this was hopelessly inadequate.</p>
              <p>The result was a grim trade in stolen corpses. <dfn class="term" data-def="People who illegally dug up freshly buried corpses from graveyards and sold them to surgeons and medical schools for dissection. Also known as &lsquo;body-snatchers,&rsquo; they operated widely in the 18th and early 19th centuries.">&ldquo;Resurrection men&rdquo;</dfn> stole fresh bodies from graves and sold them to surgeons and medical schools.

              <p>Hunter was so dedicated that he deliberately <strong>infected himself with a sexually transmitted disease</strong> to study its effects. This was an extreme and dangerous example of his belief that direct observation was the only way to truly understand disease.</p>
              <p>He also ran a large medical practice, trained <strong>hundreds of students</strong>, and wrote influential books on dentistry, gunshot wounds, and venereal diseases. His teaching shaped a generation of surgeons who spread his evidence-based methods.</p>

        <h3>Hunter and the Professionalisation of Surgery</h3>

        <p>Hunter argued that surgeons and barbers should be <strong>separated</strong> and that surgery should become a respected profession, not a trade practised by people who also cut hair. His campaigning helped establish the <dfn class="term" data-def="The professional body that oversees the practice of surgery in England. It was formally established in 1800, building on John Hunter&rsquo;s efforts to separate surgery from barbering and turn it into a respected, evidence-based profession.">Royal College of Surgeons</dfn> in 1800, which still oversees surgery in England today.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n17">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; John Hunter</div>
          <p>John Hunter promoted <strong>observation and experiment</strong> over reliance on old textbooks. He collected thousands of anatomical specimens to teach students, pioneered new surgical techniques (including tying off aneurysms instead of amputating), and helped establish surgery as a respected profession through the Royal College of Surgeons. His methods helped transform surgery into a respected, evidence-based science.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 18th century was a time of transition. New scientific thinking was taking hold &mdash; especially through figures like John Hunter &mdash; but most people still relied on old beliefs and traditional remedies. Real, widespread change would not come until the 19th century.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Old beliefs persisted:</strong> Miasma, the Four Humours, and supernatural explanations remained common, alongside quackery and herbal remedies.</li>
          <li><strong>New institutions emerged:</strong> Hospitals shifted from care to cure, doctors trained through observation, and free dispensaries helped the poor.</li>
          <li><strong>John Hunter bridged old and new:</strong> He championed observation and experimentation, helping transform surgery into a respected, evidence-based profession.</li>
