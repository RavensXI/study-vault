        <h3 data-narration-id="n5">Charles Booth&rsquo;s London Survey (1889&ndash;1903)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n6"><strong>Charles Booth</strong> was a wealthy Liverpool businessman who set out to disprove claims that poverty was widespread in London. Instead, his survey &mdash; begun in <strong>1886</strong>, published as <em>&ldquo;Life and Labour of the People in London&rdquo;</em> from <strong>1889</strong>, and continued until <strong>1903</strong> &mdash; proved the opposite. Booth found that about <strong>30% of Londoners</strong> lived in poverty so extreme they could not afford food or housing. He showed that poverty was caused by factors <strong>beyond individual control</strong> &mdash; low wages, illness, old age, and unemployment &mdash; not by laziness as many Victorians believed.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n9"><strong>Seebohm Rowntree</strong> conducted a similar study in <strong>York</strong> in <strong>1901</strong>, testing whether Booth&rsquo;s London findings applied to a smaller, more typical city. His results were strikingly similar: about <strong>28% of York&rsquo;s population</strong> lived in extreme poverty. Rowntree went further by creating the concept of a <dfn class="term" data-def="The minimum income needed to afford the basic necessities of life &mdash; food, clothing, shelter, and fuel.

            <p>Local councils were allowed (and from 1914, required) to provide <strong>free school meals</strong> for the poorest children. By 1914, over 150,000 children were receiving free meals daily. This tackled childhood malnutrition directly.</p>

            <p>All children were to receive <strong>medical inspections</strong> at school. However, initially there was no provision for treatment &mdash; children were told what was wrong with them but given no help to fix it. Free treatment was not available until 1912.</p>

        <p>Show how <strong>each step led to the next</strong>. Booth and Rowntree proved the problem. The Boer War made it a national emergency. The Liberal Reforms showed government could act but revealed the limits of partial measures. World War Two created the demand and opportunity. Beveridge provided the blueprint. The strongest answers show this as a <strong>chain of causation</strong>, not just a list of events.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The NHS in 1948 was the end of a long road &mdash; from Booth and Rowntree exposing poverty, through the Liberal Reforms&rsquo; first attempts at welfare, to Beveridge&rsquo;s wartime vision meeting post-war determination for a better Britain.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Evidence changed attitudes:</strong> Booth and Rowntree&rsquo;s statistical proof that poverty was structural, not personal, overcame the Victorian belief in self-help and laissez-faire.</li>
          <li><strong>War exposed the problem and demanded solutions:</strong> The Boer War revealed the physical cost of poverty (40% of volunteers unfit). World War Two created the mood and political will for comprehensive reform.</li>
          <li><strong>The NHS completed a long journey:</strong> From the limited Liberal Reforms to Beveridge&rsquo;s &ldquo;cradle to grave&rdquo; vision, each step built on the last. The NHS was not a sudden invention but the final piece in fifty years of change.</li>
        </ul>
