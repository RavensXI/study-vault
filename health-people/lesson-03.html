        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Diagnosis in the Medieval Period</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Medieval <dfn class="term" data-def="University-trained doctors who diagnosed illness and prescribed treatments. They studied ancient texts by Hippocrates and Galen but rarely performed surgery, which was considered a lower craft.">physicians</dfn> believed illness was caused by an imbalance in the <dfn class="term" data-def="The four bodily fluids (blood, yellow bile, black bile, phlegm) that ancient and medieval doctors believed needed to stay in balance for good health.">Four Humours</dfn>. To work out which humour was off balance, they used two main tools: a <dfn class="term" data-def="A visual guide used by medieval physicians to examine the colour, smell, and consistency of a patient&rsquo;s urine in order to diagnose which humour was out of balance.">urine chart</dfn> and a <dfn class="term" data-def="A chart showing the positions of stars and planets, consulted by medieval physicians to determine the best time to carry out treatments such as bloodletting.">zodiac chart</dfn>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">The physician examined the patient&rsquo;s urine &mdash; checking its colour, smell, and even taste &mdash; and compared it to the chart to spot the imbalance. They then checked the zodiac chart to find the best time to treat, based on the stars and planets. This mix of humoral theory and astrology was standard medical practice.</p>

          <img src="diagram_urine_chart.png" alt="A medieval urine chart showing different colours of urine and the conditions they were believed to indicate">
        </figure>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Common Medieval Treatments</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">Since physicians believed illness came from a humoral imbalance, treatments aimed to <strong>restore that balance</strong>. Some seem extreme today, but they were logical within humoral medicine.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n6">Bloodletting</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n7"><dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of deliberately removing blood from a patient, either by cutting a vein (venesection), applying leeches, or using heated cups (cupping). It was the most common medieval treatment, believed to remove excess blood and restore the balance of humours.">Bloodletting</dfn> was the most common treatment for nearly every condition. It aimed to remove excess blood &mdash; the humour most often blamed for illness. There were three main methods:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n8">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Methods of Bloodletting</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Venesection:</strong> Cutting open a vein with a sharp blade and draining blood into a bowl. The physician would use the zodiac chart to decide which vein to cut and when.</li>
            <li><strong>Leeches:</strong> Placing blood-sucking <dfn class="term" data-def="Parasitic worms that feed on blood. Medieval doctors placed them on patients&rsquo; skin to draw out blood, believing this would rebalance the humours.">leeches</dfn> on the patient&rsquo;s skin to draw out blood more slowly and with less risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Cupping:</strong> Placing heated glass cups on the skin. As the air inside cooled, it created suction that drew blood to the surface.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">Purging</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">To remove excess humours other than blood, patients were forced to empty their bodies. <dfn class="term" data-def="Substances that induce vomiting, used by medieval doctors to remove excess humours from the body.">Emetics</dfn> made patients vomit, while <dfn class="term" data-def="Substances that stimulate bowel movements, used by medieval doctors to purge excess humours from the body.">laxatives</dfn> emptied the bowels. The aim was always the same: physically remove the humour thought to be causing illness.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n11">Herbal Remedies</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">Local <dfn class="term" data-def="A person who prepared and sold herbal medicines and remedies. The medieval equivalent of a pharmacist, often running a shop where patients could buy treatments.">apothecaries</dfn> or &ldquo;<dfn class="term" data-def="Women in medieval communities who had knowledge of herbal remedies and traditional cures. They were often the first point of contact for sick people who could not afford a physician.">wise women</dfn>&rdquo; created remedies from plants and minerals. Many were based on the Theory of Opposites &mdash; using a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; herb to treat a &ldquo;cold&rdquo; illness, for example. Some had real value (honey as an antiseptic, willow bark for pain &mdash; which contains a chemical related to aspirin), but many were useless or even harmful.</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Did any medieval remedies actually work?</span>

              <p data-narration-id="n13">Some remedies worked, even though people did not understand why. Honey has natural antibacterial properties. Willow bark contains salicin, which the body converts into salicylic acid &mdash; the active ingredient in aspirin. Mint helped digestion, and garlic has proven antimicrobial properties.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n14">But many other remedies were useless or dangerous &mdash; using ground-up gems, animal dung, or mercury. Without scientific testing, there was no way to tell effective remedies from harmful ones.</p>

          <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
          <p>Always explain <strong>why</strong> a treatment was used. Don&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;they performed bloodletting.&rdquo; Say &ldquo;they performed bloodletting because they believed excess blood was causing illness, and removing it would restore the balance of the Four Humours.&rdquo; Linking treatments to the ideas behind them earns higher marks.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n16">Medieval Surgery</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">Surgery was a separate craft from medicine and a <strong>last resort</strong>. It was not done by university-trained physicians but by <dfn class="term" data-def="Tradesmen who combined haircutting and shaving with basic surgical procedures such as pulling teeth, setting broken bones, and amputating limbs. They were not university-trained and learned their skills through apprenticeships.">barber surgeons</dfn> &mdash; tradesmen who also cut hair and pulled teeth. Surgery was seen as lower-status: a manual craft, not an intellectual one.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n18">The Three Problems of Surgery</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">Medieval surgeons faced three huge problems that made any operation very dangerous:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n20">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Three Problems</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pain:</strong> There were no effective <dfn class="term" data-def="Substances used to reduce or eliminate pain during surgery. Medieval surgeons had no reliable anaesthetics, relying instead on alcohol, opium-soaked sponges, or simply knocking patients unconscious.">anaesthetics</dfn>. Patients were sometimes given alcohol or a sponge soaked in opium to dull the pain, but these were unreliable. Many patients went into shock or moved during surgery, making precise work impossible.</li>
            <li><strong>Infection:</strong> With no understanding of <dfn class="term" data-def="Microscopic organisms such as bacteria that can cause disease. Medieval people had no knowledge of germs, which were not discovered until the 19th century.">germs</dfn>, surgical instruments were not sterilised and surgeons did not wash their hands. Wounds frequently became infected after operations, and many patients died from infection rather than the original injury.</li>
            <li><strong>Bleeding:</strong> Surgeons had no reliable way to stop heavy bleeding during or after operations. Without the ability to transfuse blood or effectively seal blood vessels, patients could easily bleed to death during even minor procedures.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <img src="diagram_three_problems_surgery.png" alt="Diagram showing the three key problems of medieval surgery: pain, infection, and bleeding, and why each was so difficult to overcome">
        </figure>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n21">&ldquo;Laudable Pus&rdquo;</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n22">Many surgeons believed that pus forming in a wound was a <strong>good sign</strong> &mdash; proof the body was healing by expelling harmful humours. They called this <dfn class="term" data-def="The medieval belief that the formation of pus in a wound was a positive sign of healing. In reality, pus indicates infection, but without knowledge of germs, surgeons misinterpreted it as the body expelling harmful humours.">&ldquo;laudable pus&rdquo;</dfn>. In reality, pus is a clear sign of <strong>infection</strong>. This meant surgeons often took no steps to prevent infection &mdash; and sometimes encouraged it, with fatal results.</p>

        <h3>Key Named Surgeons</h3>

        <p>Although surgery was seen as a lower craft, several individuals pushed surgical knowledge forward:</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Abulcasis (Albucasis, c.936&ndash;1013)</div>
          <p><dfn class="term" data-def="An Islamic surgeon (c.936&ndash;1013) from Cordoba in Muslim Spain, known as the &lsquo;Father of Modern Surgery.&rsquo; He wrote Al Tasrif, a 30-volume medical encyclopaedia, and invented 26 new surgical instruments.">Abulcasis</dfn> was an Islamic surgeon from Cordoba in Muslim Spain, often called the &ldquo;Father of Modern Surgery.&rdquo; He wrote <em>Al Tasrif</em>, a <strong>30-volume medical encyclopaedia</strong> that included detailed descriptions of surgical procedures and illustrations of instruments. He invented <strong>26 new surgical instruments</strong> and popularised the use of <dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of burning a wound with a red-hot iron or caustic substance to seal it, stop bleeding, and prevent infection. Abulcasis was a major advocate of this technique.">cauterisation</dfn> to seal wounds and stop bleeding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Hugh &amp; Theodoric of Lucca (13th century)</div>
          <p><strong>Hugh of Lucca</strong> and his son <strong>Theodoric</strong> worked at the University of Bologna. Crucially, they criticised the widespread belief in <dfn class="term" data-def="The medieval belief that the formation of pus in a wound was a positive sign of healing. In reality, pus indicates infection, but without knowledge of germs, surgeons misinterpreted it as the body expelling harmful humours.">&ldquo;laudable pus&rdquo;</dfn> and argued that pus was harmful, not helpful. They used <strong>wine to clean wounds</strong> and reduce infection &mdash; an idea that went against accepted medical teaching but was far closer to modern antiseptic practice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; John of Arderne (c.1307&ndash;1392)</div>
          <p><dfn class="term" data-def="An English surgeon (c.1307&ndash;1392) who wrote Practica with detailed illustrations. He used opium for pain relief and developed a treatment for anal fistula. He campaigned to separate surgeons from barbers professionally.">John of Arderne</dfn> was an English surgeon who wrote <em>Practica</em>, a surgical text with detailed illustrations of operations and instruments. He used <strong>opium as a pain reliever</strong> during surgery and developed a successful treatment for <dfn class="term" data-def="An abnormal connection or tunnel between the anal canal and the skin near the anus. John of Arderne developed a surgical treatment for this painful condition in the 14th century.">anal fistula</dfn> &mdash; a painful condition common among knights who spent long hours on horseback. Arderne also campaigned to raise the status of surgery by separating surgeons from barbers, helping to establish the <strong>Guild of Surgeons</strong>.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n23">What Procedures Could Be Performed?</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">Despite these limits, barber surgeons did carry out a range of procedures &mdash; mostly surface-level operations or emergencies where the patient would die without intervention:</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>War as a Driver of Surgical Progress</h3>

        <p>Warfare drove surgical improvement. Most barber surgeons gained experience on the battlefield, treating sword and arrow wounds. The <strong>Wars of the Roses</strong> (1455&ndash;1487) gave over 30 years of surgical practice and pushed innovation in treating battlefield injuries. War created constant demand for practitioners who could amputate limbs, extract arrows, and cauterise wounds quickly.</p>

        <h3>Anatomy &amp; Dissection</h3>

        <p>In <strong>1315</strong>, public dissection was first allowed at the University of Bologna. <dfn class="term" data-def="An Italian physician and anatomist (c.1270&ndash;1326) who wrote Anathomia, the first modern anatomical text based on human dissection. It was used as a dissection manual in universities for over 200 years.">Mondino de Luzzi</dfn> wrote <em>Anathomia</em>, the standard dissection manual for over <strong>200 years</strong>. But dissection was mainly used to <strong>confirm Galen&rsquo;s ideas</strong>, not challenge them. The professor read from Galen while an assistant cut the body. Any differences were blamed on the body, not on Galen. It took until the Renaissance for anatomists like Vesalius to use dissection to overturn Galen&rsquo;s mistakes.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n30">Who Provided Medical Care?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n31">Different types of practitioners provided different levels of care. Access to treatment depended heavily on wealth and social class:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n32">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Types of Medical Practitioners</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Physicians:</strong> University-trained doctors who studied ancient texts. They diagnosed illness and prescribed treatments but rarely got their hands dirty. Only the wealthy could afford to consult a physician.</li>
            <li><strong>Barber surgeons:</strong> Tradesmen who performed surgery, pulled teeth, and cut hair. They learned through apprenticeships, not university training. Attempts were made to professionalise surgery and raise its status, including the formation of the <strong>Guild of Surgeons</strong>, which sought to separate trained surgeons from ordinary barbers.</li>
            <li><strong>Apothecaries:</strong> Prepared and sold herbal remedies and medicines. Similar to a modern pharmacist but without scientific training.</li>
            <li><strong>Wise women:</strong> Women in local communities who had knowledge of herbal remedies passed down through generations. Often the first point of contact for the poor.</li>
            <li><strong>The Church:</strong> Priests offered spiritual healing through prayer, and monasteries provided hospital care focused on rest and religious devotion.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>Don&rsquo;t present medieval people as &ldquo;stupid.&rdquo; Their treatments were <strong>logical within their understanding</strong> of the Four Humours.

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n34">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Medieval treatments put the Theory of the Four Humours into practice, leading to bloodletting and purging. Surgery was a separate, brutal craft &mdash; barber surgeons struggled with pain, infection, and bleeding. Some herbal remedies had real value, but without scientific understanding, treatments were often useless or dangerous.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Treatments were based on humoral theory:</strong> Bloodletting, purging, and herbal remedies all aimed to restore the balance of the Four Humours. Always link treatments to the ideas behind them in your answers.</li>
          <li><strong>Surgery was dangerous and a last resort:</strong> Barber surgeons faced pain, infection, and bleeding. &ldquo;Laudable pus&rdquo; shows how the lack of germ theory made outcomes worse.</li>
          <li><strong>Access to care depended on wealth:</strong> Physicians served the rich; the poor relied on wise women, apothecaries, or the Church.</li>
