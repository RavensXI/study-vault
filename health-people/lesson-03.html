        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Diagnosis in the Medieval Period</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Medieval <dfn class="term" data-def="University-trained doctors who diagnosed illness and prescribed treatments.">physicians</dfn> believed illness was caused by an imbalance in the <dfn class="term" data-def="The four bodily fluids (blood, yellow bile, black bile, phlegm) that ancient and medieval doctors believed needed to stay in balance for good health.">Four Humours</dfn>. To work out which humour was off balance, they used two main tools: a <dfn class="term" data-def="A visual guide used by medieval physicians to examine the colour, smell, and consistency of a patient&rsquo;s urine in order to diagnose which humour was out of balance.">urine chart</dfn> and a <dfn class="term" data-def="A chart showing the positions of stars and planets, consulted by medieval physicians to determine the best time to carry out treatments such as bloodletting.">zodiac chart</dfn>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">The physician examined the patient&rsquo;s urine &mdash; checking its colour, smell, and even taste &mdash; and compared it to the chart to spot the imbalance. They then checked the zodiac chart to find the best time to treat, based on the stars and planets. This mix of humoral theory and astrology was standard medical practice.</p>

          <img src="diagram_urine_chart.png" alt="A medieval urine chart showing different colours of urine and the conditions they were believed to indicate">
        </figure>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Common Medieval Treatments</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">Since physicians believed illness came from a humoral imbalance, treatments aimed to <strong>restore that balance</strong>. Some seem extreme today, but they were logical within humoral medicine.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n6">Bloodletting</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n7"><dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of deliberately removing blood from a patient, either by cutting a vein (venesection), applying leeches, or using heated cups (cupping).">Bloodletting</dfn> was the most common treatment for nearly every condition. It aimed to remove excess blood &mdash; the humour most often blamed for illness. There were three main methods:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n8">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Methods of Bloodletting</div>
          <ul data-narration-id="n35">
            <li><strong>Venesection:</strong> Cutting open a vein with a sharp blade and draining blood into a bowl. The physician would use the zodiac chart to decide which vein to cut and when.</li>
            <li><strong>Leeches:</strong> Placing blood-sucking <dfn class="term" data-def="Parasitic worms that feed on blood.">leeches</dfn> on the patient&rsquo;s skin to draw out blood more slowly and with less risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Cupping:</strong> Placing heated glass cups on the skin. As the air inside cooled, it created suction that drew blood to the surface.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">Purging</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">To remove excess humours other than blood, patients were forced to empty their bodies. <dfn class="term" data-def="Substances that induce vomiting, used by medieval doctors to remove excess humours from the body.">Emetics</dfn> made patients vomit, while <dfn class="term" data-def="Substances that stimulate bowel movements, used by medieval doctors to purge excess humours from the body.">laxatives</dfn> emptied the bowels. The aim was always the same: physically remove the humour thought to be causing illness.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n11">Herbal Remedies</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">Local <dfn class="term" data-def="A person who prepared and sold herbal medicines and remedies.">apothecaries</dfn> or &ldquo;<dfn class="term" data-def="Women in medieval communities who had knowledge of herbal remedies and traditional cures.">wise women</dfn>&rdquo; created remedies from plants and minerals. Many were based on the Theory of Opposites &mdash; using a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; herb to treat a &ldquo;cold&rdquo; illness, for example. Some had real value (honey as an antiseptic, willow bark for pain &mdash; which contains a chemical related to aspirin), but many were useless or even harmful.</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Did any medieval remedies actually work?</span>

              <p data-narration-id="n13">Some remedies worked, even though people did not understand why. Honey has natural antibacterial properties. Willow bark contains salicin, which the body converts into salicylic acid &mdash; the active ingredient in aspirin. Mint helped digestion, and garlic has proven antimicrobial properties.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n14">But many other remedies were useless or dangerous &mdash; using ground-up gems, animal dung, or mercury. Without scientific testing, there was no way to tell effective remedies from harmful ones.</p>

          <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
          <p>Always explain <strong>why</strong> a treatment was used. Don&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;they performed bloodletting.&rdquo; Say &ldquo;they performed bloodletting because they believed excess blood was causing illness, and removing it would restore the balance of the Four Humours.&rdquo; Linking treatments to the ideas behind them earns higher marks.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n16">Medieval Surgery</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">Surgery was a separate craft from medicine and a <strong>last resort</strong>. It was not done by university-trained physicians but by <dfn class="term" data-def="Tradesmen who combined haircutting and shaving with basic surgical procedures such as pulling teeth, setting broken bones, and amputating limbs.">barber surgeons</dfn> &mdash; tradesmen who also cut hair and pulled teeth. Surgery was seen as lower-status: a manual craft, not an intellectual one.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n18">The Three Problems of Surgery</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">Medieval surgeons faced three huge problems that made any operation very dangerous:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n20">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Three Problems</div>
          <ul data-narration-id="n36">
            <li><strong>Pain:</strong> There were no effective <dfn class="term" data-def="Substances used to reduce or eliminate pain during surgery.">anaesthetics</dfn>. Patients were sometimes given alcohol or a sponge soaked in opium to dull the pain, but these were unreliable. Many patients went into shock or moved during surgery, making precise work impossible.</li>
            <li><strong>Infection:</strong> With no understanding of <dfn class="term" data-def="Microscopic organisms such as bacteria that can cause disease.">germs</dfn>, surgical instruments were not sterilised and surgeons did not wash their hands. Wounds frequently became infected after operations, and many patients died from infection rather than the original injury.</li>
            <li><strong>Bleeding:</strong> Surgeons had no reliable way to stop heavy bleeding during or after operations. Without the ability to transfuse blood or effectively seal blood vessels, patients could easily bleed to death during even minor procedures.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_three_problems_surgery.png" alt="Diagram showing the three key problems of medieval surgery: pain, infection, and bleeding, and why each was so difficult to overcome">
        </figure>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n21">&ldquo;Laudable Pus&rdquo;</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n22">Many surgeons believed that pus forming in a wound was a <strong>good sign</strong> &mdash; proof the body was healing by expelling harmful humours. They called this <dfn class="term" data-def="The medieval belief that the formation of pus in a wound was a positive sign of healing.">&ldquo;laudable pus&rdquo;</dfn>. In reality, pus is a clear sign of <strong>infection</strong>. This meant surgeons often took no steps to prevent infection &mdash; and sometimes encouraged it, with fatal results.</p>

        <h3>Key Named Surgeons</h3>

        <p>Although surgery was seen as a lower craft, several individuals pushed surgical knowledge forward:</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Abulcasis (Albucasis, c.936&ndash;1013)</div>
          <p><dfn class="term" data-def="An Islamic surgeon (c.936&ndash;1013) from Cordoba in Muslim Spain, known as the &lsquo;Father of Modern Surgery.&rsquo; He wrote Al Tasrif, a 30-volume medical encyclopaedia, and invented 26 new surgical instruments.">Abulcasis</dfn> was an Islamic surgeon from Cordoba in Muslim Spain, often called the &ldquo;Father of Modern Surgery.&rdquo; He wrote <em>Al Tasrif</em>, a <strong>30-volume medical encyclopaedia</strong> that included detailed descriptions of surgical procedures and illustrations of instruments. He invented <strong>26 new surgical instruments</strong> and popularised the use of <dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of burning a wound with a red-hot iron or caustic substance to seal it, stop bleeding, and prevent infection.">cauterisation</dfn> to seal wounds and stop bleeding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Hugh &amp; Theodoric of Lucca (13th century)</div>
          <p><strong>Hugh of Lucca</strong> and his son <strong>Theodoric</strong> worked at the University of Bologna. Crucially, they criticised the widespread belief in <dfn class="term" data-def="The medieval belief that the formation of pus in a wound was a positive sign of healing.">&ldquo;laudable pus&rdquo;</dfn> and argued that pus was harmful, not helpful. They used <strong>wine to clean wounds</strong> and reduce infection &mdash; an idea that went against accepted medical teaching but was far closer to modern antiseptic practice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; John of Arderne (c.1307&ndash;1392)</div>
          <p><dfn class="term" data-def="An English surgeon (c.1307&ndash;1392) who wrote Practica with detailed illustrations.">John of Arderne</dfn> was an English surgeon who wrote <em>Practica</em>, a surgical text with detailed illustrations of operations and instruments. He used <strong>opium as a pain reliever</strong> during surgery and developed a successful treatment for <dfn class="term" data-def="An abnormal connection or tunnel between the anal canal and the skin near the anus.">anal fistula</dfn> &mdash; a painful condition common among knights who spent long hours on horseback. Arderne also campaigned to raise the status of surgery by separating surgeons from barbers, helping to establish the <strong>Guild of Surgeons</strong>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">Despite these limits, barber surgeons did carry out a range of procedures &mdash; mostly surface-level operations or emergencies where the patient would die without intervention:</p>

        <h3>War as a Driver of Surgical Progress</h3>

        <p>Warfare drove surgical improvement. Most barber surgeons gained experience on the battlefield, treating sword and arrow wounds. The <strong>Wars of the Roses</strong> (1455&ndash;1487) gave over 30 years of surgical practice and pushed innovation in treating battlefield injuries. War created constant demand for practitioners who could amputate limbs, extract arrows, and cauterise wounds quickly.</p>

        <h3>Anatomy &amp; Dissection</h3>

        <p>In <strong>1315</strong>, public dissection was first allowed at the University of Bologna. <dfn class="term" data-def="An Italian physician and anatomist (c.1270&ndash;1326) who wrote Anathomia, the first modern anatomical text based on human dissection.">Mondino de Luzzi</dfn> wrote <em>Anathomia</em>, the standard dissection manual for over <strong>200 years</strong>. But dissection was mainly used to <strong>confirm Galen&rsquo;s ideas</strong>, not challenge them. The professor read from Galen while an assistant cut the body. Any differences were blamed on the body, not on Galen. It took until the Renaissance for anatomists like Vesalius to use dissection to overturn Galen&rsquo;s mistakes.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n30">Who Provided Medical Care?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n31">Different types of practitioners provided different levels of care. Access to treatment depended heavily on wealth and social class:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n32">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Types of Medical Practitioners</div>
          <ul data-narration-id="n37">
            <li><strong>Physicians:</strong> University-trained doctors who studied ancient texts. They diagnosed illness and prescribed treatments but rarely got their hands dirty. Only the wealthy could afford to consult a physician.</li>
            <li><strong>Barber surgeons:</strong> Tradesmen who performed surgery, pulled teeth, and cut hair. They learned through apprenticeships, not university training. Attempts were made to professionalise surgery and raise its status, including the formation of the <strong>Guild of Surgeons</strong>, which sought to separate trained surgeons from ordinary barbers.</li>
            <li><strong>Apothecaries:</strong> Prepared and sold herbal remedies and medicines. Similar to a modern pharmacist but without scientific training.</li>
            <li><strong>Wise women:</strong> Women in local communities who had knowledge of herbal remedies passed down through generations. Often the first point of contact for the poor.</li>
            <li><strong>The Church:</strong> Priests offered spiritual healing through prayer, and monasteries provided hospital care focused on rest and religious devotion.</li>

        <p>Don&rsquo;t present medieval people as &ldquo;stupid.&rdquo; Their treatments were <strong>logical within their understanding</strong> of the Four Humours. The best answers explain the reasoning behind treatments, acknowledge some remedies had real value, and identify the barriers (lack of technology, Church control, respect for ancient authority) that prevented progress.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n34">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Medieval treatments put the Theory of the Four Humours into practice, leading to bloodletting and purging. Surgery was a separate, brutal craft &mdash; barber surgeons struggled with pain, infection, and bleeding. Some herbal remedies had real value, but without scientific understanding, treatments were often useless or dangerous.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n38">
          <li><strong>Treatments were based on humoral theory:</strong> Bloodletting, purging, and herbal remedies all aimed to restore the balance of the Four Humours. Always link treatments to the ideas behind them in your answers.</li>
          <li><strong>Surgery was dangerous and a last resort:</strong> Barber surgeons faced pain, infection, and bleeding. &ldquo;Laudable pus&rdquo; shows how the lack of germ theory made outcomes worse.</li>
          <li><strong>Access to care depended on wealth:</strong> Physicians served the rich; the poor relied on wise women, apothecaries, or the Church.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of aspects of significance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining the relationship between aspects of significance, for example over time.\nExample: Barber surgeons were significant because they were the main providers of surgical care for ordinary people, yet their low status reflected the divide between theoretical and practical medicine that held back progress. Physicians studied ancient texts at university but never performed surgery; barber surgeons learned through apprenticeships and battlefield experience but lacked theoretical knowledge. This separation meant surgical innovation was slow. However, individuals like John of Arderne pushed boundaries \u2014 he used opium for pain relief, developed a treatment for anal fistula, and campaigned to establish the Guild of Surgeons to raise surgery\u2019s status. Over time, the professionalisation of surgery (separating it from barbering) was a crucial step towards the modern medical profession.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of aspects of significance. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more aspects of significance.\nExample: Barber surgeons were significant because they provided the only surgical care available to most people. They performed amputations, set broken bones, pulled teeth, and cauterised wounds. However, they faced three huge problems: pain (no effective anaesthetics), infection (no understanding of germs), and bleeding (no way to stop heavy blood loss). The belief in \u2018laudable pus\u2019 made things worse, as surgeons thought pus was a good sign rather than evidence of infection.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of significance. Students progress from basic explanation by simple reasoning of one identified aspect.\nExample: Barber surgeons were significant because they were the only people who performed surgery in the medieval period. They learned through apprenticeships rather than university training and carried out procedures like amputations and tooth extractions.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of significance. Students identify aspect(s) relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Barber surgeons performed operations like amputations and pulling teeth.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of similarities. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining complexities of similarities arising from the broader historical context.\nExample: Both medieval and 18th-century hospitals focused more on care than on cure, and both were largely funded by charity rather than by the state. Medieval hospitals were run by religious orders and provided food, shelter, warmth, and prayer \u2014 only about 10% actually treated the sick. Similarly, 18th-century hospitals were funded by wealthy patrons and public subscriptions, and while they admitted more sick patients, they still lacked effective treatments because germ theory had not yet been discovered. Both types of hospital also refused to admit patients with infectious diseases to protect other residents. This continuity reflects the fact that without understanding what caused disease, hospitals could not offer real cures in either period.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of similarities. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more identified similarities.\nExample: Both medieval and 18th-century hospitals were charitable institutions rather than state-funded. Medieval hospitals were run by monks and nuns, while 18th-century hospitals were funded by wealthy donors. Both also focused on providing care rather than cure \u2014 medieval hospitals offered food, shelter, and prayer, while 18th-century hospitals still lacked effective treatments for most diseases.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one similarity. Students progress from basic explanation by reasoning supported with factual knowledge.\nExample: Both medieval and 18th-century hospitals were funded by charity, not the government. Medieval hospitals were run by religious orders, while 18th-century hospitals relied on wealthy patrons and public donations.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of similarity/similarities. Students identify similarity/similarities relevant to the question.

Students progress from developed explanation by explaining complexities of similarities arising from the broader historical context.\nExample: Both periods faced the same three fundamental problems of surgery \u2014 pain, infection, and bleeding \u2014 and in both periods, surgery remained a last resort. In the Middle Ages, barber surgeons used alcohol, opium sponges, or simply restrained patients during operations, while in Hunter\u2019s time (18th century), surgeons still relied on speed and crude restraint because effective anaesthetics had not been developed. Infection was a problem in both periods because germ theory was not understood until the 1860s: medieval surgeons believed in \u2018laudable pus\u2019, and 18th-century surgeons still operated in dirty conditions with unwashed instruments. This continuity shows that until the key scientific breakthroughs of the 19th century (anaesthetics in 1846, antiseptic surgery in 1867), surgery remained fundamentally dangerous.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of similarities.

Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: War has been an important factor at several points but was not consistently the main driver across the whole period. In the medieval era, the Wars of the Roses gave barber surgeons decades of practice treating battlefield injuries, driving practical surgical improvement. Par\u00e9\u2019s discovery of a better wound treatment came on the battlefield when he ran out of hot oil. WWI produced major advances including mobile X-ray units, blood transfusion techniques, and the Thomas splint for broken legs. WWII drove the mass production of penicillin when the US government funded Florey and Chain\u2019s work. However, war only accelerated existing discoveries \u2014 it did not create new theoretical understanding. Germ theory, the Four Humours, and vaccination all developed outside wartime. Science and technology was the more consistent factor across the whole period.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): War drove surgical progress. Medieval barber surgeons gained most of their experience treating battlefield wounds. Par\u00e9 discovered his healing balm as a French army surgeon. WWI produced mobile X-ray units, blood transfusions, and the Thomas splint. WWII led to mass production of penicillin.\nExample (other factor): Individuals were also important regardless of war. Vesalius corrected over 300 of Galen\u2019s anatomical errors through human dissection in 1543. Harvey proved blood circulates in 1628. Pasteur developed germ theory in 1861. Jenner pioneered vaccination in 1796. None of these breakthroughs were driven by war.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: War helped surgery improve because barber surgeons gained experience treating wounds on the battlefield. The Wars of the Roses (1455\u20131487) gave over 30 years of practice amputating limbs, extracting arrows, and cauterising wounds.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: War helped because surgeons got more practice treating injured soldiers.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."

Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Individuals were crucial in driving surgical progress at every stage, but they always depended on other factors. In the medieval period, Abulcasis invented 26 surgical instruments and popularised cauterisation, while Hugh and Theodoric of Lucca challenged the belief in \u2018laudable pus\u2019 by cleaning wounds with wine. John of Arderne used opium for pain relief and helped professionalise surgery through the Guild of Surgeons. Par\u00e9 discovered his wound balm by chance and promoted ligatures. In the 19th century, Simpson introduced chloroform anaesthesia (1847), Lister developed antiseptic surgery (1867), and in the 20th century, Barnard performed the first heart transplant (1967). However, these individuals could only succeed because of enabling factors: war gave Par\u00e9 battlefield experience, technology gave Lister carbolic acid, and government funding enabled mass production of penicillin. Individuals were essential but not sufficient alone.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Individuals drove key breakthroughs in surgery. Abulcasis invented 26 new instruments and wrote a 30-volume surgical encyclopaedia. Par\u00e9 replaced cauterisation with a soothing balm and introduced ligatures. Lister developed antiseptic surgery using carbolic acid in 1867, dramatically reducing infection.\nExample (other factor): Science and technology was also vital. Without germ theory (Pasteur, 1861), Lister could not have understood why antiseptics worked. Without anaesthetics (ether 1846, chloroform 1847), complex surgery was impossible. Without blood transfusion technology, patients could not survive major operations.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Individuals were important because Par\u00e9 improved surgery by discovering that a mixture of egg yolk, rose oil, and turpentine healed wounds better than cauterisation with boiling oil. He also introduced ligatures to tie off blood vessels after amputation.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Individuals like Par\u00e9 and Lister made important changes to surgery.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms.

Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Science and technology was not the main factor in the medieval period \u2014 the three problems of surgery (pain, infection, bleeding) persisted because the scientific understanding to solve them did not exist. However, from the 19th century onwards, science became the dominant factor. Anaesthetics (ether 1846, chloroform 1847) solved pain; Pasteur\u2019s germ theory (1861) enabled Lister\u2019s antiseptic surgery (1867) to tackle infection; and blood transfusion technology (blood groups discovered 1901, stored blood from WWI) solved bleeding. In the modern era, technology drives almost all progress: keyhole surgery, robotic surgery, organ transplants, and MRI scanners. However, these advances often depended on individuals (Par\u00e9, Lister, Barnard) and war (WWI and WWII accelerated surgical techniques and penicillin production). Science and technology was the most consistently important factor across the full period.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Science and technology transformed surgery. Anaesthetics (1846) solved the problem of pain. Pasteur\u2019s germ theory led to Lister\u2019s antiseptic surgery, solving infection. Blood transfusion technology solved bleeding. Modern technology like robotic surgery and organ transplants would be impossible without science.\nExample (other factor): War also drove surgical progress. Medieval barber surgeons gained experience on the battlefield. WWI produced mobile X-ray units and blood transfusion techniques. WWII led to mass production of penicillin, which reduced surgical infections dramatically.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Science and technology was important because the three problems of surgery \u2014 pain, infection, and bleeding \u2014 could only be solved by scientific discoveries like anaesthetics and antiseptics.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Science helped surgery because anaesthetics stopped pain during operations.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.
