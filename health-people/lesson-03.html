        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Diagnosis in the Medieval Period</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Medieval <dfn class="term" data-def="University-trained doctors who diagnosed illness and prescribed treatments. They studied ancient texts by Hippocrates and Galen but rarely performed surgery, which was considered a lower craft.">physicians</dfn> believed that illness was caused by an imbalance in the <dfn class="term" data-def="The four bodily fluids (blood, yellow bile, black bile, phlegm) that ancient and medieval doctors believed needed to stay in balance for good health.">Four Humours</dfn>. To work out which humour was out of balance, a physician would use two main diagnostic tools: a <dfn class="term" data-def="A visual guide used by medieval physicians to examine the colour, smell, and consistency of a patient&rsquo;s urine in order to diagnose which humour was out of balance.">urine chart</dfn> and a <dfn class="term" data-def="A chart showing the positions of stars and planets, consulted by medieval physicians to determine the best time to carry out treatments such as bloodletting.">zodiac chart</dfn>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">The physician would examine the patient&rsquo;s urine &mdash; checking its colour, smell, and even taste &mdash; and compare it to the chart to identify the imbalance. They would then consult the zodiac chart to determine when the best time to treat the patient would be, based on the position of the stars and planets. This combination of humoral theory and astrology was considered standard medical practice.</p>

          <img src="diagram_urine_chart.png" alt="A medieval urine chart showing different colours of urine and the conditions they were believed to indicate">
        </figure>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Common Medieval Treatments</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">Since physicians believed illness was caused by an imbalance in the humours, their treatments were designed to <strong>restore that balance</strong>. This led to several common practices, some of which seem extreme by modern standards but were entirely logical within the framework of humoral medicine.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n6">Bloodletting</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n7"><dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of deliberately removing blood from a patient, either by cutting a vein (venesection), applying leeches, or using heated cups (cupping). It was the most common medieval treatment, believed to remove excess blood and restore the balance of humours.">Bloodletting</dfn> was the most common treatment for nearly every condition. It was performed to remove an excess of blood &mdash; the humour most frequently blamed for illness. There were three main methods:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n8">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Methods of Bloodletting</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Venesection:</strong> Cutting open a vein with a sharp blade and draining blood into a bowl. The physician would use the zodiac chart to decide which vein to cut and when.</li>
            <li><strong>Leeches:</strong> Placing blood-sucking <dfn class="term" data-def="Parasitic worms that feed on blood. Medieval doctors placed them on patients&rsquo; skin to draw out blood, believing this would rebalance the humours.">leeches</dfn> on the patient&rsquo;s skin to draw out blood more slowly and with less risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Cupping:</strong> Placing heated glass cups on the skin. As the air inside cooled, it created suction that drew blood to the surface.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">Purging</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">To get rid of excess humours other than blood, patients were given treatments to forcefully empty their bodies. <dfn class="term" data-def="Substances that induce vomiting, used by medieval doctors to remove excess humours from the body.">Emetics</dfn> were given to make patients vomit, while <dfn class="term" data-def="Substances that stimulate bowel movements, used by medieval doctors to purge excess humours from the body.">laxatives</dfn> were used to empty the bowels. The aim was always the same: to physically remove the humour that was believed to be causing the illness.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n11">Herbal Remedies</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">Local <dfn class="term" data-def="A person who prepared and sold herbal medicines and remedies. The medieval equivalent of a pharmacist, often running a shop where patients could buy treatments.">apothecaries</dfn> or &ldquo;<dfn class="term" data-def="Women in medieval communities who had knowledge of herbal remedies and traditional cures. They were often the first point of contact for sick people who could not afford a physician.">wise women</dfn>&rdquo; created remedies from plants and minerals. Many of these herbal remedies were based on the Theory of Opposites &mdash; using a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; herb to treat a &ldquo;cold&rdquo; illness, for example. Some remedies had genuine medicinal value (such as using honey as an antiseptic or willow bark for pain, which contains a chemical related to modern aspirin), but many were ineffective or even harmful.</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Did any medieval remedies actually work?</span>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n13">Some herbal remedies were surprisingly effective, even though the people using them did not understand the science behind them. Honey has natural antibacterial properties and was used to treat wounds. Willow bark contains salicin, which the body converts into salicylic acid &mdash; the active ingredient in aspirin. Mint was used for digestive problems, and garlic has proven antimicrobial properties.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n14">However, many other remedies were completely useless or dangerous. Some recipes involved ingredients like ground-up precious stones, animal dung, or mercury. The key point is that without scientific testing, there was no reliable way to tell effective remedies from harmful ones.</p>

          <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
          <p>In exams, always explain <strong>why</strong> a treatment was used. Don&rsquo;t just say, &ldquo;they performed bloodletting.&rdquo; Instead, explain that &ldquo;they performed bloodletting because they believed the patient&rsquo;s illness was caused by an excess of blood, and removing blood would restore the balance of the Four Humours.&rdquo; Linking treatments to the ideas behind them shows deeper understanding and earns higher marks.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n16">Medieval Surgery</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">Surgery in the medieval period was a completely separate craft from medicine and was considered a <strong>last resort</strong>. It was not performed by university-trained physicians but by <dfn class="term" data-def="Tradesmen who combined haircutting and shaving with basic surgical procedures such as pulling teeth, setting broken bones, and amputating limbs. They were not university-trained and learned their skills through apprenticeships.">barber surgeons</dfn> &mdash; tradesmen who also cut hair and pulled teeth. Surgery was seen as a lower-status occupation, a manual craft rather than an intellectual discipline.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n18">The Three Problems of Surgery</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">Medieval surgeons faced three enormous problems that made any operation extremely dangerous:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n20">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Three Problems</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pain:</strong> There were no effective <dfn class="term" data-def="Substances used to reduce or eliminate pain during surgery. Medieval surgeons had no reliable anaesthetics, relying instead on alcohol, opium-soaked sponges, or simply knocking patients unconscious.">anaesthetics</dfn>. Patients were sometimes given alcohol or a sponge soaked in opium to dull the pain, but these were unreliable. Many patients went into shock or moved during surgery, making precise work impossible.</li>
            <li><strong>Infection:</strong> With no understanding of <dfn class="term" data-def="Microscopic organisms such as bacteria that can cause disease. Medieval people had no knowledge of germs, which were not discovered until the 19th century.">germs</dfn>, surgical instruments were not sterilised and surgeons did not wash their hands. Wounds frequently became infected after operations, and many patients died from infection rather than the original injury.</li>
            <li><strong>Bleeding:</strong> Surgeons had no reliable way to stop heavy bleeding during or after operations. Without the ability to transfuse blood or effectively seal blood vessels, patients could easily bleed to death during even minor procedures.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_three_problems_surgery.png" alt="Diagram showing the three key problems of medieval surgery: pain, infection, and bleeding, and why each was so difficult to overcome">
        </figure>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n21">&ldquo;Laudable Pus&rdquo;</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n22">One of the most telling details about medieval surgery is the concept of <dfn class="term" data-def="The medieval belief that the formation of pus in a wound was a positive sign of healing. In reality, pus indicates infection, but without knowledge of germs, surgeons misinterpreted it as the body expelling harmful humours.">&ldquo;laudable pus&rdquo;</dfn>. Many surgeons believed that the formation of pus in a wound was actually a <strong>good sign</strong> &mdash; evidence that the body was healing properly by expelling harmful humours. In reality, pus is a clear sign of <strong>infection</strong>. This misunderstanding meant that surgeons often took no steps to prevent infection and sometimes even encouraged it, with fatal consequences.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n23">What Procedures Could Be Performed?</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">Despite these enormous limitations, barber surgeons did carry out a range of procedures. These were generally restricted to surface-level operations or emergencies where the patient would die anyway without intervention:</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n25"><strong>Amputation:</strong> Removing a badly injured or gangrenous limb. This was done quickly to minimise pain and bleeding. The wound was then cauterised (sealed with a red-hot iron) to stop the bleeding.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n26"><strong>Trepanning:</strong> Drilling or cutting a hole in the skull, believed to release evil spirits or relieve pressure. Archaeological evidence shows that some patients survived this procedure.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n27"><strong>Setting broken bones:</strong> Barber surgeons could set simple fractures and create splints, though compound fractures (where bone breaks through the skin) were usually fatal due to infection.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n28"><strong>Cauterisation:</strong> Using a red-hot iron to seal wounds and stop bleeding. This was extremely painful but could be effective at preventing blood loss.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n29"><strong>Pulling teeth:</strong> One of the most common procedures performed by barber surgeons, since tooth decay was widespread in the medieval period.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n30">Who Provided Medical Care?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n31">It is important to understand that in the medieval period, different types of practitioners provided different levels of care. Access to treatment depended heavily on wealth and social class:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n32">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Types of Medical Practitioners</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Physicians:</strong> University-trained doctors who studied ancient texts. They diagnosed illness and prescribed treatments but rarely got their hands dirty. Only the wealthy could afford to consult a physician.</li>
            <li><strong>Barber surgeons:</strong> Tradesmen who performed surgery, pulled teeth, and cut hair. They learned through apprenticeships, not university training.</li>
            <li><strong>Apothecaries:</strong> Prepared and sold herbal remedies and medicines. Similar to a modern pharmacist but without scientific training.</li>
            <li><strong>Wise women:</strong> Women in local communities who had knowledge of herbal remedies passed down through generations. Often the first point of contact for the poor.</li>
            <li><strong>The Church:</strong> Priests offered spiritual healing through prayer, and monasteries provided hospital care focused on rest and religious devotion.</li>
          </ul>

      <!-- Exam Tip -->
      <div class="exam-tip" data-narration-id="n33">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When discussing medieval treatments, avoid presenting medieval people as simply &ldquo;stupid.&rdquo; Their treatments were <strong>logical within their understanding</strong> of the Four Humours. The best exam answers explain the reasoning behind treatments, acknowledge that some remedies had genuine value, and identify the key barriers (lack of technology, Church control, respect for ancient authority) that prevented progress.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n34">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Medieval treatments were the practical application of the Theory of the Four Humours, leading to common practices like bloodletting and purging. Surgery was a separate and brutal craft performed by barber surgeons who struggled with the huge problems of pain, infection, and bleeding. While some herbal remedies had genuine medicinal value, the lack of scientific understanding meant that treatments were often ineffective or dangerous.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Treatments were based on humoral theory:</strong> Bloodletting, purging, and herbal remedies were all designed to restore the balance of the Four Humours. Always link treatments back to the ideas that justified them in your exam answers.</li>
          <li><strong>Surgery was dangerous and a last resort:</strong> Barber surgeons faced the three critical problems of pain, infection, and bleeding. The concept of &ldquo;laudable pus&rdquo; shows how the lack of germ theory actively made outcomes worse.</li>
          <li><strong>Access to care depended on wealth:</strong> Physicians served the rich, while the poor relied on wise women, apothecaries, or the Church. Understanding this social dimension adds depth to exam answers.</li>
