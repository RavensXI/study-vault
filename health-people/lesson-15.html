        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The Paradox of Progress</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Modern public health is, in many ways, a victim of its own success. Vaccination, antibiotics, better sanitation, and the NHS have all extended life expectancy. But living longer has created new challenges. The diseases that dominate modern Britain are not the infectious epidemics of the past, but long-term <dfn class="term" data-def="Conditions where the body's cells, tissues, or organs gradually deteriorate over time.">degenerative conditions</dfn> and illnesses linked to the way we live.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>In 1900, average life expectancy in Britain was around <strong>47 years</strong>. By 2020, it had risen to over <strong>81 years</strong>. This extraordinary improvement is the result of centuries of medical progress &mdash; but it means today&rsquo;s biggest health challenges are diseases of old age and lifestyle, not the infectious diseases that once killed millions.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">New Diseases &amp; Lifestyle Challenges</h2>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n5">Long-Term Degenerative Conditions</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">As people live longer, the biggest medical challenges are conditions where the body slowly breaks down over time. These include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n7">
          <li><strong>Cancer</strong> &mdash; abnormal cell growth that can affect almost any part of the body. Risk increases significantly with age.</li>
          <li><strong>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease</strong> &mdash; a progressive brain disorder that destroys memory and cognitive function. It is the most common cause of <dfn class="term" data-def="A general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life.">dementia</dfn>.</li>
          <li><strong>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</strong> &mdash; a condition affecting movement, causing tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n8">Lifestyle Diseases</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">Many of today&rsquo;s most common illnesses are linked to modern lifestyles &mdash; poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and heavy drinking. These <dfn class="term" data-def="Diseases caused or worsened by the way people live rather than by infection.">lifestyle diseases</dfn> include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n10">
          <li><strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong> &mdash; strongly linked to obesity and poor diet. Cases have risen dramatically in recent decades.</li>
          <li><strong>Heart disease</strong> &mdash; the leading cause of death in the UK, linked to smoking, high-fat diets, and lack of exercise.</li>
          <li><strong>Some cancers</strong> &mdash; including lung cancer (linked to smoking), liver cancer (linked to alcohol), and bowel cancer (linked to processed meat and low-fibre diets).</li>
        </ul>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_lifestyle_diseases.png" alt="Diagram showing the connection between modern lifestyle factors (poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, alcohol) and the rise of lifestyle diseases (type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers)">
        </figure>

        <h3>Mental Health</h3>

        <p><dfn class="term" data-def="A person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being.">Mental health</dfn> is now one of the biggest public health challenges. Depression, anxiety, and eating disorders affect millions in Britain. Mental health services have always received less funding than physical health, despite affecting a similar number of people. Stigma has also made it harder for people to seek help, though awareness campaigns have begun to change this.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n11">Antibiotic Resistance</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">One of the most serious global health threats today is <dfn class="term" data-def="The ability of bacteria to survive and multiply despite being exposed to antibiotics that would normally kill them.">antibiotic resistance</dfn>. Decades of overusing antibiotics &mdash; in both human medicine and farming &mdash; have created <dfn class="term" data-def="Bacteria that have evolved resistance to multiple antibiotics, making infections extremely difficult to treat.">superbugs</dfn>: bacteria that have evolved to survive the drugs designed to kill them.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n13">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p><dfn class="term" data-def="Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a strain of bacteria resistant to several widely used antibiotics.">MRSA</dfn> is one of the best-known superbugs. If antibiotic resistance continues to grow, routine operations like hip replacements, caesarean sections, and even dental surgery could become life-threatening because doctors would be unable to prevent or treat post-operative infections. The World Health Organization has called antibiotic resistance &ldquo;one of the biggest threats to global health.&rdquo;</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Why has antibiotic resistance become such a problem?</span>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n14">Antibiotics have been overprescribed for decades &mdash; given for viral infections (where they have no effect), not finished by patients (letting partly resistant bacteria survive), and used routinely in farming to promote growth. Each time antibiotics are used wrongly, it gives bacteria a chance to evolve resistance.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n15">At the same time, drug companies have invested less in new antibiotics because they are less profitable than drugs for long-term conditions. The result is a growing gap between resistant infections and the drugs available to treat them.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n16">Challenges for the NHS</h2>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n17">An Ageing Population</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">Britain&rsquo;s population is ageing. Better healthcare and rising life expectancy mean more people are living into their 80s and 90s. This is a triumph of medical progress, but it puts huge pressure on the NHS. Older people are far more likely to have chronic conditions &mdash; heart disease, diabetes, dementia &mdash; that need expensive, ongoing care.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n19">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>People aged 65 and over account for around <strong>40% of NHS spending</strong>, despite making up less than 20% of the population. As the proportion of elderly people grows, the financial pressure on the NHS will only increase &mdash; raising difficult questions about how healthcare is funded and prioritised.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n20">Rising Costs &amp; Expectations</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">Modern medicine can achieve extraordinary things &mdash; but at huge cost. Treatments like <dfn class="term" data-def="The use of powerful drugs to destroy cancer cells.">chemotherapy</dfn>, <dfn class="term" data-def="The use of high-energy radiation to destroy cancer cells.">radiotherapy</dfn>, robotic surgery, and gene therapy are all expensive. The NHS now costs around <strong>&pound;201 billion per year</strong> to run. At the same time, public expectations have risen &mdash; people expect the latest treatments and shorter waiting times. Balancing demand against limited resources is one of the NHS&rsquo;s greatest ongoing challenges.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n22">Government Public Health Campaigns</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">Faced with rising lifestyle diseases, governments have used campaigns and laws to change behaviour and prevent illness. This continues the tradition of government action in public health that stretches back to the <dfn class="term" data-def="Laws passed in the nineteenth century (1848, 1875) to improve sanitation, clean water supply, and housing conditions.">Public Health Acts</dfn> of the nineteenth century.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n25"><strong>Sugar tax:</strong> The 2018 Soft Drinks Industry Levy pushes manufacturers to cut sugar in drinks. It targets childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n26"><strong>Alcohol limits:</strong> Government campaigns promote lower recommended limits (14 units per week) to reduce liver disease, some cancers, and alcohol-related harm.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n27"><strong>COVID-19 response:</strong> The <dfn class="term" data-def="The global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which began in 2019-2020.">COVID-19 pandemic</dfn> (2020&ndash;2021) was the most dramatic government public health action in living memory. National lockdowns, mass testing, and the fastest vaccine rollout in history showed the scale of modern intervention &mdash; but also exposed inequalities in health outcomes based on income, ethnicity, and geography.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n28">The Rise of Alternative Medicine &amp; Skepticism</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n29">Despite huge advances in modern medicine, interest has grown in <dfn class="term" data-def="Medical treatments that fall outside mainstream, evidence-based medicine.">alternative medicine</dfn> &mdash; treatments like acupuncture, aromatherapy, homeopathy, and hypnotherapy that sit outside mainstream evidence-based medicine. Some people turn to these when conventional medicine cannot cure their condition, or because they prefer a more &ldquo;natural&rdquo; approach.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n30">Vaccine Skepticism</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n31">A more dangerous trend is growing vaccine skepticism. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield published a fraudulent study claiming the <dfn class="term" data-def="The combined vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella, given to young children.">MMR vaccine</dfn> caused autism. The study was later <strong>thoroughly discredited</strong> &mdash; Wakefield was struck off the medical register and the paper was retracted &mdash; but the damage was done. Vaccination rates dropped, and measles &mdash; almost eliminated &mdash; began to return.</p>

          <p>The MMR scare is a powerful example of how misinformation can undermine public health. Lower vaccination rates in some areas led to outbreaks of measles &mdash; a preventable disease.

The scandal led to much stricter drug testing and regulation, and is a stark reminder that thorough testing is essential before treatments reach patients.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Think about the &ldquo;paradox of progress&rdquo; &mdash; medical successes creating new problems. Antibiotics saved millions but created superbugs. Living longer means more demand for expensive care. The NHS provides universal healthcare but struggles with costs. This <strong>evaluative thinking</strong> &mdash; showing that progress brings both benefits and new challenges &mdash; is what examiners reward at the highest levels.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip &mdash; Cure vs Prevention</div>
        <p>Modern public health has two broad approaches: <strong>cure</strong> (treating diseases through drugs, surgery, or technology like chemotherapy, transplants, and gene therapy) and <strong>prevention</strong> (stopping diseases before they happen through vaccination, lifestyle campaigns, or laws like the smoking ban and sugar tax). Strong exam answers discuss <em>both</em> and evaluate which has had more impact. This framework shows the analytical thinking that earns top marks.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Modern public health is shaped by the paradox of progress. Past breakthroughs &mdash; vaccination, antibiotics, sanitation, the NHS &mdash; have extended life expectancy, but also created new challenges. Today&rsquo;s biggest threats are lifestyle illnesses, antibiotic resistance from decades of overuse, the financial strain of an ageing population, and the need to harness genetic medicine while keeping it accessible and affordable.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n40">
          <li><strong>The paradox of progress:</strong> Medical success has created new problems &mdash; lifestyle diseases, superbugs, and the rising costs of an ageing population are all consequences of earlier breakthroughs.</li>
          <li><strong>Government intervention continues:</strong> From smoking bans and sugar taxes to the COVID-19 lockdowns, the government remains central to public health &mdash; continuing the tradition that began with the nineteenth-century Public Health Acts.</li>
          <li><strong>Genetic medicine is the new frontier:</strong> The Human Genome Project, gene therapy, and personalised medicine could transform twenty-first century healthcare &mdash; just as vaccination, germ theory, and antibiotics did before.</li>

Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining the relationship between aspects of significance, for example over time.\nExample: The Human Genome Project is significant because it represents a fundamental shift in medicine \u2014 from treating diseases after they appear to understanding and preventing them at the genetic level. By mapping all 20,000\u201325,000 human genes, it laid the foundation for gene therapy (replacing faulty genes to treat inherited conditions), personalised medicine (tailoring treatments to a patient\u2019s genetic profile), and genetic testing (identifying risks like BRCA1 mutations before disease develops, as Angelina Jolie\u2019s case demonstrated in 2013). Its long-term significance may rival the greatest breakthroughs in medical history: just as Pasteur\u2019s Germ Theory (1861) explained what caused infectious disease, the Genome Project explains the genetic basis of conditions from cancer to cystic fibrosis. However, it also raises ethical questions about privacy, cost, and unequal access \u2014 echoing the same debates about who benefits from medical progress that have run through the entire course.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of aspects of significance. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more aspects of significance.\nExample: The Human Genome Project was significant because it mapped the entire human genetic code, identifying approximately 20,000\u201325,000 genes. This has led to gene therapy trials for conditions like inherited blindness and some cancers, and allows personalised medicine where treatments are tailored to a patient\u2019s DNA. It also made genetic testing possible, allowing people to identify their risk of developing certain diseases.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of significance. Students progress from basic explanation by simple reasoning of one identified aspect.\nExample: The Human Genome Project was significant because it mapped all human genes, which has allowed scientists to develop gene therapy \u2014 replacing faulty genes to treat diseases that were previously untreatable.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of significance.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of similarities. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining complexities of similarities arising from the broader historical context.\nExample: In both the nineteenth and twenty-first centuries, governments used legislation to change behaviour and improve public health, often against resistance from those who saw it as interference in personal liberty. The 1875 Public Health Act forced local councils to provide clean water, sewers, and sanitation to combat cholera and other waterborne diseases. Similarly, the 2007 smoking ban in enclosed public places targeted lung cancer and heart disease, and the 2018 sugar tax aimed to reduce childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes. Both periods also saw government action triggered by evidence of a public health crisis: in the nineteenth century, cholera epidemics and the Great Stink (1858) forced action; in the twenty-first century, rising rates of lifestyle diseases and the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the ongoing need for government intervention. In both cases, the tension between individual freedom and collective health shaped the debate.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of similarities. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more identified similarities.\nExample: In both centuries, the government passed laws to improve public health. In the nineteenth century, the 1875 Public Health Act made clean water and proper sewers compulsory. In the twenty-first century, the 2007 smoking ban and 2018 sugar tax aimed to reduce lifestyle diseases. Both also faced opposition \u2014 people in the 1800s saw public health laws as interfering with freedom, just as some oppose the sugar tax today.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one similarity. Students progress from basic explanation by reasoning supported with factual knowledge.\nExample: In both centuries, the government used laws to try to improve health. The 1875 Public Health Act made clean water compulsory, and the 2007 smoking ban stopped people smoking in public places to reduce disease.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of similarity/similarities.

Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining the relationship between aspects of significance, for example over time.\nExample: Antibiotic resistance is significant because it threatens to reverse one of the greatest medical breakthroughs in history. Penicillin and later antibiotics have saved hundreds of millions of lives since the 1940s, but decades of overuse \u2014 in human medicine (prescribing for viral infections, patients not finishing courses) and in farming (routine use to promote animal growth) \u2014 have allowed bacteria to evolve resistance. Superbugs like MRSA are already extremely difficult to treat. The WHO has called antibiotic resistance \u2018one of the biggest threats to global health.\u2019 If resistance continues to grow, routine operations like hip replacements and caesarean sections could become life-threatening because post-operative infections would be untreatable. This represents a \u2018paradox of progress\u2019 \u2014 the very success of antibiotics has created the conditions for their failure, echoing how earlier medical triumphs (like increased life expectancy) created new challenges (lifestyle diseases, ageing population costs).\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of aspects of significance. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more aspects of significance.\nExample: Antibiotic resistance is significant because superbugs like MRSA are very difficult to treat and could make common infections deadly again. It is also significant because it was caused by overuse of antibiotics \u2014 doctors prescribing them for viral infections and patients not finishing courses \u2014 meaning it is a man-made problem that could have been prevented.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of significance. Students progress from basic explanation by simple reasoning of one identified aspect.\nExample: Antibiotic resistance is significant because bacteria like MRSA have evolved to survive antibiotics. This means that infections which were once easy to treat could become deadly again.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of significance. Students identify aspect(s) relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Antibiotic resistance is important because some bacteria cannot be killed by antibiotics any more.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Explain your answer with reference to the role of the individual and other factors. Use a range of examples from across your study of Health and the people: c1000 to the present day.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Individuals have been essential in understanding disease causes, but their success has always depended on wider factors. In the medieval period, Galen\u2019s Theory of the Four Humours dominated for over 1,000 years \u2014 but this was because the Church (religion) enforced his authority and banned dissection. Vesalius (1543) began challenging Galen, but only because the Renaissance allowed questioning. The key breakthroughs came from individuals in the modern period: Pasteur proved Germ Theory (1861), Koch identified specific bacteria causing tuberculosis (1882) and cholera (1883), and Snow traced cholera to contaminated water (1854) before Germ Theory even existed. In the modern era, Watson and Crick discovered DNA\u2019s structure (1953) with Rosalind Franklin\u2019s X-ray work, and the Human Genome Project (1990\u20132003) mapped the genetic basis of disease. However, these individuals depended on science and technology (microscopes for Pasteur, X-ray crystallography for DNA) and government (funding the Genome Project, establishing the NHS to apply new knowledge). The MMR scare shows the fragility of progress \u2014 Wakefield\u2019s fraudulent 1998 study undermined public trust in vaccination, demonstrating that understanding causes of disease only matters if the public accepts and acts on that knowledge.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Individuals have been crucial. Pasteur proved that germs caused disease (1861), overturning the old theory of spontaneous generation. Koch identified specific bacteria causing specific diseases like tuberculosis and cholera. John Snow proved cholera was waterborne in 1854. Watson and Crick discovered DNA\u2019s structure in 1953. Without these individuals, our understanding of disease would be far behind.\nExample (other factor): However, science and technology was essential. Pasteur needed improved microscopes to observe microorganisms. Koch used new staining techniques to identify specific bacteria. The Human Genome Project depended on advanced computing technology to map human DNA. Individuals made the discoveries, but technology gave them the tools.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Individuals were important because Louis Pasteur proved that germs caused disease in 1861. Before this, people believed in spontaneous generation or the miasma theory. Pasteur\u2019s discovery changed how doctors understood and treated illness.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Individuals were important because people like Pasteur discovered what caused disease.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Chance has played a dramatic role at key moments but has never been the most important factor overall. Fleming\u2019s discovery of penicillin (1928) is the most famous example \u2014 mould accidentally landed on his petri dish. But Fleming\u2019s \u2018prepared mind\u2019 (trained under Koch, motivated by WWI experience) meant he recognised its significance. Even then, penicillin needed Florey and Chain\u2019s systematic research (individual), WWII\u2019s urgency (war), and US government investment (government) to become a mass-produced drug. Par\u00e9 discovered his wound salve by accident when he ran out of boiling oil (1537), but he had the surgical expertise to observe the difference. Jenner\u2019s observation of milkmaids and smallpox (1796) was partly chance, but he systematically tested his hypothesis. In the medieval period, chance played almost no role \u2014 progress was blocked by religious authority and a lack of scientific knowledge. In the modern era, developments like the Human Genome Project and gene therapy are entirely deliberate, driven by science, technology, and government funding. Chance opens doors, but only when prepared minds, institutional support, and scientific knowledge are present to walk through them.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Chance has been important at key moments. Fleming discovered penicillin by chance in 1928 when mould landed on his petri dish. Par\u00e9 discovered his wound salve accidentally in 1537. Jenner\u2019s observation of milkmaids and cowpox was a chance observation that led to vaccination.\nExample (other factor): However, science and technology has been more important overall. Pasteur\u2019s Germ Theory (1861) was the result of systematic experiments. Koch deliberately identified specific bacteria. The Human Genome Project (1990\u20132003) was a planned international research programme. These deliberate scientific efforts have had more lasting impact than chance.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Chance was important because Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin by accident in 1928. Mould landed on his petri dish and killed the bacteria around it. Without this lucky accident, penicillin might never have been found.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Chance helped medicine because some important discoveries were accidents.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Government has been the most consistently important factor in public health because only government has the power to enforce nationwide change. In the medieval period, local government\u2019s attempts at quarantine during the Black Death (1348) were ineffective without scientific understanding. The 1848 Public Health Act was a landmark but voluntary. The compulsory 1875 Public Health Act \u2014 requiring clean water, sewers, and sanitation \u2014 was the first effective nationwide measure, but it needed John Snow\u2019s cholera investigation (individual) and the Great Stink (1858) to trigger action. The Liberal Reforms (1906\u20131914) introduced school meals, pensions, and national insurance, driven by Booth and Rowntree\u2019s evidence (individuals/communication) and the Boer War (war). The NHS (1948) was the most significant government intervention, making free healthcare universal. In the modern era, the 2007 smoking ban, 2018 sugar tax, and COVID-19 lockdowns all show government\u2019s continuing central role. However, government has almost always acted in response to pressure from other factors \u2014 epidemics, war, scientific discoveries, or campaigning individuals. Government translates knowledge and public demand into policy; it rarely leads from the front.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Government has been crucial. The 1875 Public Health Act made clean water and sewers compulsory. The Liberal Reforms (1906\u20131914) introduced school meals and pensions. The NHS (1948) provided free healthcare for all. The 2007 smoking ban and 2018 sugar tax target modern lifestyle diseases. The COVID-19 lockdowns showed the scale of modern government intervention.\nExample (other factor): However, science and technology has also been vital. Pasteur\u2019s Germ Theory (1861) gave the scientific basis for understanding how diseases spread. Without this knowledge, government measures like clean water provision would not have been introduced. The Human Genome Project has opened up genetic medicine for the future.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Government has been important because it has passed laws to improve public health. The 1875 Public Health Act required local councils to provide clean water and sewers. The NHS in 1948 gave everyone free healthcare. The smoking ban in 2007 reduced lung cancer.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Government helped public health by creating the NHS and banning smoking in public places.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.
