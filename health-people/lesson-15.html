        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The Paradox of Progress</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Modern public health is, in many ways, a victim of its own success. Vaccination, antibiotics, better sanitation, and the NHS have all extended life expectancy. But living longer has created new challenges. The diseases that dominate modern Britain are not the infectious epidemics of the past, but long-term <dfn class="term" data-def="Conditions where the body's cells, tissues, or organs gradually deteriorate over time. Examples include cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. They are more common in older populations and are a growing challenge as life expectancy increases.">degenerative conditions</dfn> and illnesses linked to the way we live.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>In 1900, average life expectancy in Britain was around <strong>47 years</strong>. By 2020, it had risen to over <strong>81 years</strong>. This extraordinary improvement is the result of centuries of medical progress &mdash; but it means today&rsquo;s biggest health challenges are diseases of old age and lifestyle, not the infectious diseases that once killed millions.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">New Diseases &amp; Lifestyle Challenges</h2>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n5">Long-Term Degenerative Conditions</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">As people live longer, the biggest medical challenges are conditions where the body slowly breaks down over time. These include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n7">
          <li><strong>Cancer</strong> &mdash; abnormal cell growth that can affect almost any part of the body. Risk increases significantly with age.</li>
          <li><strong>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease</strong> &mdash; a progressive brain disorder that destroys memory and cognitive function. It is the most common cause of <dfn class="term" data-def="A general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. It is a growing challenge as populations age.">dementia</dfn>.</li>
          <li><strong>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</strong> &mdash; a condition affecting movement, causing tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n8">Lifestyle Diseases</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">Many of today&rsquo;s most common illnesses are linked to modern lifestyles &mdash; poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and heavy drinking. These <dfn class="term" data-def="Diseases caused or worsened by the way people live rather than by infection. Examples include type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. They are strongly linked to diet, exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption.">lifestyle diseases</dfn> include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n10">
          <li><strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong> &mdash; strongly linked to obesity and poor diet. Cases have risen dramatically in recent decades.</li>
          <li><strong>Heart disease</strong> &mdash; the leading cause of death in the UK, linked to smoking, high-fat diets, and lack of exercise.</li>
          <li><strong>Some cancers</strong> &mdash; including lung cancer (linked to smoking), liver cancer (linked to alcohol), and bowel cancer (linked to processed meat and low-fibre diets).</li>
        </ul>

        <figure class="diagram">

        </figure>

        <h3>Mental Health</h3>

        <p><dfn class="term" data-def="A person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders affect millions of people and are increasingly recognised as a major public health challenge requiring greater funding and support.">Mental health</dfn> is now one of the biggest public health challenges. Depression, anxiety, and eating disorders affect millions in Britain. Mental health services have always received less funding than physical health, despite affecting a similar number of people. Stigma has also made it harder for people to seek help, though awareness campaigns have begun to change this.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n11">Antibiotic Resistance</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">One of the most serious global health threats today is <dfn class="term" data-def="The ability of bacteria to survive and multiply despite being exposed to antibiotics that would normally kill them. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics have allowed resistant 'superbugs' like MRSA to evolve, threatening to make once-treatable infections deadly again.">antibiotic resistance</dfn>. Decades of overusing antibiotics &mdash; in both human medicine and farming &mdash; have created <dfn class="term" data-def="Bacteria that have evolved resistance to multiple antibiotics, making infections extremely difficult to treat. MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is one of the best-known examples.">superbugs</dfn>: bacteria that have evolved to survive the drugs designed to kill them.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n13">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p><dfn class="term" data-def="Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a strain of bacteria resistant to several widely used antibiotics. MRSA infections are particularly dangerous in hospitals and can be life-threatening.">MRSA</dfn> is one of the best-known superbugs. If antibiotic resistance continues to grow, routine operations like hip replacements, caesarean sections, and even dental surgery could become life-threatening because doctors would be unable to prevent or treat post-operative infections. The World Health Organization has called antibiotic resistance &ldquo;one of the biggest threats to global health.&rdquo;</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Why has antibiotic resistance become such a problem?</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n14">Antibiotics have been overprescribed for decades &mdash; given for viral infections (where they have no effect), not finished by patients (letting partly resistant bacteria survive), and used routinely in farming to promote growth. Each time antibiotics are used wrongly, it gives bacteria a chance to evolve resistance.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n15">At the same time, drug companies have invested less in new antibiotics because they are less profitable than drugs for long-term conditions. The result is a growing gap between resistant infections and the drugs available to treat them.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n16">Challenges for the NHS</h2>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n17">An Ageing Population</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">Britain&rsquo;s population is ageing. Better healthcare and rising life expectancy mean more people are living into their 80s and 90s. This is a triumph of medical progress, but it puts huge pressure on the NHS. Older people are far more likely to have chronic conditions &mdash; heart disease, diabetes, dementia &mdash; that need expensive, ongoing care.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n19">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>People aged 65 and over account for around <strong>40% of NHS spending</strong>, despite making up less than 20% of the population. As the proportion of elderly people grows, the financial pressure on the NHS will only increase &mdash; raising difficult questions about how healthcare is funded and prioritised.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n20">Rising Costs &amp; Expectations</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">Modern medicine can achieve extraordinary things &mdash; but at huge cost. Treatments like <dfn class="term" data-def="The use of powerful drugs to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy can be highly effective but often causes severe side effects because it also damages healthy cells. It is one of the three main cancer treatments alongside surgery and radiotherapy.">chemotherapy</dfn>, <dfn class="term" data-def="The use of high-energy radiation to destroy cancer cells. It can be targeted at specific areas of the body and is often used alongside surgery and chemotherapy as part of cancer treatment.">radiotherapy</dfn>, robotic surgery, and gene therapy are all expensive. The NHS now costs around <strong>&pound;201 billion per year</strong> to run. At the same time, public expectations have risen &mdash; people expect the latest treatments and shorter waiting times. Balancing demand against limited resources is one of the NHS&rsquo;s greatest ongoing challenges.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n22">Government Public Health Campaigns</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">Faced with rising lifestyle diseases, governments have used campaigns and laws to change behaviour and prevent illness. This continues the tradition of government action in public health that stretches back to the <dfn class="term" data-def="Laws passed in the nineteenth century (1848, 1875) to improve sanitation, clean water supply, and housing conditions. They marked the beginning of government responsibility for public health.">Public Health Acts</dfn> of the nineteenth century.</p>

The UK government's response included national lockdowns, mass vaccination programmes, and the furlough scheme. It demonstrated both the power and the challenges of modern government public health action.">COVID-19 pandemic</dfn> (2020&ndash;2021) was the most dramatic government public health action in living memory. National lockdowns, mass testing, and the fastest vaccine rollout in history showed the scale of modern intervention &mdash; but also exposed inequalities in health outcomes based on income, ethnicity, and geography.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n28">The Rise of Alternative Medicine &amp; Skepticism</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n29">Despite huge advances in modern medicine, interest has grown in <dfn class="term" data-def="Medical treatments that fall outside mainstream, evidence-based medicine. Examples include acupuncture, aromatherapy, homeopathy, and hypnotherapy. While some people find them helpful, most have limited scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness.">alternative medicine</dfn> &mdash; treatments like acupuncture, aromatherapy, homeopathy, and hypnotherapy that sit outside mainstream evidence-based medicine. Some people turn to these when conventional medicine cannot cure their condition, or because they prefer a more &ldquo;natural&rdquo; approach.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n30">Vaccine Skepticism</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n31">A more dangerous trend is growing vaccine skepticism. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield published a fraudulent study claiming the <dfn class="term" data-def="The combined vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella, given to young children. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield falsely claimed a link between MMR and autism. The study was later found to be fraudulent and was retracted, and Wakefield was struck off the medical register.">MMR vaccine</dfn> caused autism. The study was later <strong>thoroughly discredited</strong> &mdash; Wakefield was struck off the medical register and the paper was retracted &mdash; but the damage was done. Vaccination rates dropped, and measles &mdash; almost eliminated &mdash; began to return.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n32">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The MMR scare is a powerful example of how misinformation can undermine public health. Lower vaccination rates in some areas led to outbreaks of measles &mdash; a preventable disease. It demonstrates that public health progress is never permanent and can be reversed by loss of public trust.</p>

In the late 1950s, thalidomide was prescribed to pregnant women for morning sickness. It caused severe birth defects &mdash; thousands of babies were born with shortened or missing limbs. The scandal led to much stricter drug testing and regulation, and is a stark reminder that thorough testing is essential before treatments reach patients.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n33">Genetic Medicine &amp; DNA</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n34">One of the most exciting areas of modern medicine is <dfn class="term" data-def="A branch of medicine that uses knowledge of a person's genetic makeup (DNA) to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease.

        <p>Think about the &ldquo;paradox of progress&rdquo; &mdash; medical successes creating new problems. Antibiotics saved millions but created superbugs. Living longer means more demand for expensive care. The NHS provides universal healthcare but struggles with costs. This <strong>evaluative thinking</strong> &mdash; showing that progress brings both benefits and new challenges &mdash; is what examiners reward at the highest levels.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip &mdash; Cure vs Prevention</div>
        <p>Modern public health has two broad approaches: <strong>cure</strong> (treating diseases through drugs, surgery, or technology like chemotherapy, transplants, and gene therapy) and <strong>prevention</strong> (stopping diseases before they happen through vaccination, lifestyle campaigns, or laws like the smoking ban and sugar tax). Strong exam answers discuss <em>both</em> and evaluate which has had more impact. This framework shows the analytical thinking that earns top marks.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Modern public health is shaped by the paradox of progress. Past breakthroughs &mdash; vaccination, antibiotics, sanitation, the NHS &mdash; have extended life expectancy, but also created new challenges. Today&rsquo;s biggest threats are lifestyle illnesses, antibiotic resistance from decades of overuse, the financial strain of an ageing population, and the need to harness genetic medicine while keeping it accessible and affordable.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The paradox of progress:</strong> Medical success has created new problems &mdash; lifestyle diseases, superbugs, and the rising costs of an ageing population are all consequences of earlier breakthroughs.</li>
          <li><strong>Government intervention continues:</strong> From smoking bans and sugar taxes to the COVID-19 lockdowns, the government remains central to public health &mdash; continuing the tradition that began with the nineteenth-century Public Health Acts.</li>
          <li><strong>Genetic medicine is the new frontier:</strong> The Human Genome Project, gene therapy, and personalised medicine could transform twenty-first century healthcare &mdash; just as vaccination, germ theory, and antibiotics did before.</li>
        </ul>
