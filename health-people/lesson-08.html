        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Introduction: The Invisible Enemy</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">For centuries, nobody knew what caused disease. People blamed &ldquo;bad air&rdquo; (<dfn class="term" data-def="The theory that disease was caused by 'bad air' or foul-smelling vapours rising from rotting matter, swamps, or sewage. This was widely believed from ancient times until the acceptance of Germ Theory in the late 19th century.">miasma</dfn>), punishment from God, or imbalances in the <dfn class="term" data-def="An ancient Greek medical theory which claimed the body contained four liquids (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile) that needed to be in balance for good health.">Four Humours</dfn>. In the 1860s, two scientists &mdash; one French, one German &mdash; revealed the true cause: tiny, invisible organisms called <dfn class="term" data-def="Microscopic organisms such as bacteria and viruses that can cause disease. Also called microbes. Their role in causing disease was not understood until Pasteur's Germ Theory in 1861.">germs</dfn>.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">Louis Pasteur and the Germ Theory (1861)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4"><strong>Louis Pasteur</strong> was a French <strong>chemist</strong>, not a doctor. He was asked to investigate why <strong>beer and wine</strong> were going sour in the barrel &mdash; a serious problem for France&rsquo;s wine industry. This practical, industrial problem &mdash; not a medical question &mdash; led to one of the biggest discoveries in medicine.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">Pasteur discovered that tiny living organisms &mdash; <dfn class="term" data-def="Tiny living organisms, also called germs, that are too small to see with the naked eye. Pasteur discovered that microbes floating in the air caused decay in liquids like beer and broth, and proposed that they could also cause disease in humans.">microbes</dfn> or &ldquo;germs&rdquo; &mdash; were floating in the air and causing the beer to spoil. This was revolutionary. Most scientists believed in <dfn class="term" data-def="The widely held (but incorrect) belief that living organisms could arise from non-living matter. For example, people believed that maggots simply appeared from rotting meat, rather than understanding that flies laid eggs on the meat. Pasteur's experiments disproved this theory.">spontaneous generation</dfn> &mdash; the idea that decay and life simply appeared out of nowhere.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n7">The broth stayed <strong>fresh</strong>. But when the neck was broken off, letting microbes fall in, it quickly went <strong>cloudy and sour</strong>. This proved that germs in the air caused decay &mdash; not spontaneous generation.</p>

He proved germs were causing it &mdash; a key step in linking germs to disease in <strong>living organisms</strong>, not just decay in liquids.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n9">Robert Koch: The Microbe Hunter</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">Pasteur had the big idea &mdash; that germs cause disease. The German doctor <strong>Robert Koch</strong> provided the practical proof. Koch studied under <strong>Professor Friedrich Henle</strong>, one of the first scientists to challenge <dfn class="term" data-def="The widely held (but incorrect) belief that living organisms could arise from non-living matter. For example, people believed that maggots simply appeared from rotting meat, rather than understanding that flies laid eggs on the meat. Pasteur's experiments disproved this theory.">spontaneous generation</dfn>. He also served as a surgeon during the <strong>Franco-Prussian War (1870&ndash;71)</strong>, giving him first-hand experience of wounds and infection. Koch took Pasteur&rsquo;s theory and developed a way to identify the <strong>specific microbes</strong> that caused <strong>specific diseases</strong>.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n11">Koch&rsquo;s Methods</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">Koch developed key techniques for studying bacteria. He established the principle of <dfn class="term" data-def="The idea, established by Robert Koch, that each specific disease is caused by a specific type of germ. This was a major breakthrough because it meant each disease could potentially be individually identified, targeted, and treated.">specificity</dfn> &mdash; that <strong>specific germs cause specific diseases</strong>. This meant each disease could be identified, targeted, and treated individually.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Koch&rsquo;s Techniques</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Growing bacteria:</strong> Koch was the first to grow bacteria on a solid medium using <dfn class="term" data-def="A jelly-like substance used as a solid surface for growing bacteria in a laboratory. Koch pioneered the use of agar plates to create pure cultures of a single type of bacterium, making it possible to study individual germs.">agar jelly</dfn> plates. This allowed him to create <dfn class="term" data-def="A laboratory sample containing only one specific type of bacterium, with no contamination from other microbes. Pure cultures were essential for Koch's work because they allowed him to prove which specific germ caused which specific disease.">pure cultures</dfn> &mdash; samples containing only one type of bacterium &mdash; so he could study each germ individually.</li>
            <li><strong>Staining bacteria:</strong> Koch used industrial chemical <dfn class="term" data-def="Chemical substances used to colour bacteria so they could be seen more clearly under a microscope. Different bacteria absorbed different dyes, making it possible to identify and distinguish between different types of germs.">dyes</dfn> to stain bacteria, making them visible under a microscope. Different bacteria absorbed different dyes, allowing him to tell them apart.</li>
            <li><strong>Photographing bacteria:</strong> Koch developed methods of <strong>photographing microbes</strong> under the microscope, creating permanent visual records that other scientists around the world could study and verify.</li>
            <li><strong>Proving infection:</strong> Koch proved bacteria caused disease by <strong>injecting mice with anthrax bacteria</strong> and observing them fall ill. This provided direct experimental evidence that a specific germ caused a specific disease in a living organism.</li>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n15">The Impact on Britain</h2>

Several British doctors helped promote the new ideas:</p>

        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pasteur provided the theory:</strong> His 1861 Germ Theory proved microbes cause decay and proposed they cause disease. His swan-necked flask experiment disproved spontaneous generation.</li>
          <li><strong>Koch provided the proof:</strong> Using agar jelly plates and chemical dyes, he identified bacteria causing anthrax (1876), TB (1882), and cholera (1883).</li>
          <li><strong>The impact was huge:</strong> Germ Theory confirmed Snow&rsquo;s cholera findings, inspired Lister&rsquo;s antiseptic surgery, and enabled Ehrlich&rsquo;s &ldquo;magic bullets.&rdquo;</li>
