        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">War as a Factor in Medical Progress</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">An estimated 18&ndash;20 million died in World War One and 50&ndash;80 million in World War Two. This mass suffering created an urgent need for medical innovation, driving rapid advances in surgery, treatment, and technology. War has appeared again and again as a driving force behind medical change. The pressure of saving lives in extreme conditions speeds up innovation that might otherwise take decades. This lesson traces that thread from the medieval battlefield to the modern operating theatre.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>War accelerates medical progress for three main reasons: it creates <strong>urgency</strong> (thousands of wounded need treating), it provides <strong>funding</strong> (governments invest heavily in wartime medicine), and it offers a <strong>testing ground</strong> (new techniques can be tried on a massive scale).</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Medieval &amp; Renaissance Warfare: Ambroise Par&eacute;</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">In the sixteenth century, the standard treatment for gunshot wounds was to pour boiling oil into the wound to &ldquo;cauterise&rdquo; it. The French barber-surgeon <dfn class="term" data-def="A French barber-surgeon (1510&ndash;1590) who made key advances in treating wounds.">Ambroise Par&eacute;</dfn> changed this by accident. During the siege of Turin in 1537, he ran out of boiling oil and improvised a mixture of egg yolk, rose oil, and turpentine. Soldiers treated with the salve healed better and suffered less pain.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n6">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Par&eacute; also promoted the use of <dfn class="term" data-def="Threads of silk or other material used to tie off blood vessels during surgery to prevent bleeding.">ligatures</dfn> &mdash; threads of silk tied around blood vessels during amputation to control bleeding, replacing the agonising method of cauterisation with a hot iron. However, ligatures carried a risk of infection, a problem that would not be solved until the development of <dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of preventing infection during surgery.">antiseptic surgery</dfn> centuries later.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n7">The Crimean War &amp; Nursing: Florence Nightingale</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">The <dfn class="term" data-def="A war fought between 1853 and 1856, mainly on the Crimean Peninsula in the Black Sea.">Crimean War</dfn> (1853&ndash;1856) exposed the terrible state of military hospitals. At the British base hospital in <dfn class="term" data-def="A large barracks hospital near Istanbul used by British forces during the Crimean War.">Scutari</dfn>, soldiers were dying not from their wounds but from infections, cholera, and dysentery caused by filthy conditions. <strong>Florence Nightingale</strong> arrived in 1854 with 38 nurses and transformed the hospital.</p>

        <figure class="diagram">

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Nightingale&rsquo;s reforms at Scutari cut the death rate from <strong>42% to just 2%</strong>. She insisted on scrubbing the wards, providing clean bedding, improving ventilation, and serving nutritious food. She used statistical evidence &mdash; including her famous &ldquo;coxcomb&rdquo; diagrams &mdash; to prove that most deaths were caused by preventable diseases, not battle injuries.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n12">World War I &amp; II: A Surgical Revolution</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">The two World Wars produced medical advances on a huge scale. Millions of wounded soldiers and massive government funding created the conditions for major breakthroughs.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n14">X-Rays on the Battlefield</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n15"><dfn class="term" data-def="A form of electromagnetic radiation discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen in 1895.">X-rays</dfn>, discovered by Wilhelm R&ouml;ntgen in 1895, became essential in WWI for locating bullets, shrapnel, and fractures. <strong>Marie Curie</strong> developed mobile X-ray units &mdash; &ldquo;petites Curies&rdquo; &mdash; mounted in vehicles driven to field hospitals near the front lines. By the end of WWI, over a million soldiers had been X-rayed.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n16">Blood Transfusions</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">Before WWI, <dfn class="term" data-def="The transfer of blood from one person to another.">blood transfusions</dfn> were unreliable and dangerous. Karl Landsteiner had identified blood groups (A, B, AB, O) in 1901, but mass wartime casualties drove their practical use. During WWI, doctors learned to store blood using sodium citrate (which stopped it clotting). By WWII, the first <dfn class="term" data-def="Facilities for collecting, testing, storing, and distributing donated blood for transfusions.">blood banks</dfn> were set up, giving a reliable supply for treating battlefield casualties.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n18">Plastic Surgery</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">The horrific facial injuries caused by trench warfare in WWI led to modern <dfn class="term" data-def="Surgery to repair, reconstruct, or alter the human body.">plastic surgery</dfn>. <strong>Harold Gillies</strong>, from New Zealand, set up a dedicated ward at the Queen&rsquo;s Hospital in Sidcup, Kent, developing techniques to rebuild faces destroyed by shrapnel and burns. His cousin, <strong>Archibald McIndoe</strong>, advanced these techniques during WWII, treating RAF pilots with severe burns.</p>

        <p>Just as Par&eacute; had to innovate when facing new types of gunshot wounds in the 1500s, Gillies faced new injuries caused by high-explosive shells. In both cases, new weapons demanded new surgical responses &mdash; and the pressure of treating devastating injuries on a massive scale drove surgeons to develop techniques that would have been unthinkable in peacetime.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n20">Penicillin: From Laboratory to Mass Production</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n21"><dfn class="term" data-def="The first widely used antibiotic, discovered accidentally by Alexander Fleming in 1928 when he noticed mould killing bacteria in a petri dish.">Penicillin</dfn> was discovered by <strong>Alexander Fleming</strong> in 1928, but WWII turned it from a lab curiosity into a life-saving drug. <strong>Howard Florey</strong> and <strong>Ernst Chain</strong> developed methods to produce it in usable amounts, and the US government funded mass production to treat wounded soldiers. By D-Day (June 1944), there was enough penicillin to treat every Allied casualty.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n22">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Penicillin is one of the clearest examples of how war accelerates medical progress. Fleming discovered it in 1928, but without the <strong>urgency</strong> of WWII and the <strong>funding</strong> from the US government, mass production might have taken many more years. By 1944, penicillin was saving thousands of lives on the battlefield &mdash; and after the war, it revolutionised civilian medicine too.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Carrel-Dakin Method</h3>

        <p>Before antibiotics, one of the most important WWI wound-care advances was the <dfn class="term" data-def="A wound treatment technique developed during WWI by surgeon Alexis Carrel and chemist Henry Dakin.">Carrel-Dakin method</dfn>. Surgeon Alexis Carrel and chemist Henry Dakin developed a technique of continuously running an antiseptic solution &mdash; <dfn class="term" data-def="A dilute solution of bleach (sodium hypochlorite) used as an antiseptic to clean wounds.">sodium hypochlorite</dfn> &mdash; through wounds using tubes. It killed bacteria and cut infection rates sharply. The method was a vital bridge between Lister&rsquo;s antiseptic techniques and the antibiotic revolution that came with penicillin.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n23">War &amp; Public Health</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">War also transformed public health policy by exposing the poor health of the general population.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n31">Modern Technology and Surgery</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n32">War drove surgical progress for centuries, but in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, technology has become an equally powerful force for change. Many wartime breakthroughs have been refined and expanded by peacetime research.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n33">Transplant Surgery</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n34">In 1967, South African surgeon <strong>Christiaan Barnard</strong> performed the world&rsquo;s first successful human <dfn class="term" data-def="A surgical operation in which a diseased or damaged organ is replaced with a healthy organ from a donor.">heart transplant</dfn>. The patient, Louis Washkansky, survived for 18 days. Early patients often died from organ rejection, but <dfn class="term" data-def="Drugs that suppress the body's immune system to prevent it from attacking a transplanted organ.">immunosuppressant drugs</dfn> (especially cyclosporine in the 1980s) greatly improved survival rates.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n35">Keyhole &amp; Robotic Surgery</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n36"><dfn class="term" data-def="Also called laparoscopic surgery.">Keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery</dfn> changed operations from the 1980s onwards. Instead of large incisions, surgeons insert tiny cameras and instruments through small cuts. This means less pain, smaller scars, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n37"><dfn class="term" data-def="Surgery performed using robotic systems controlled by a surgeon.">Robotic surgery</dfn> takes this further. Systems like the <strong>da Vinci surgical robot</strong> (introduced in 2000) allow surgeons to control robotic arms with greater precision than the human hand, making extremely delicate operations possible.</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_modern_surgery_tech.jpg" alt="Diagram comparing traditional open surgery, keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery, and robotic surgery, showing the progression towards smaller incisions and greater precision">
        </figure>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n38">Scanning Technology</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n39">Modern technology has transformed doctors&rsquo; ability to see inside the body without surgery. <dfn class="term" data-def="Computed Tomography scan.">CT scans</dfn> (1970s) use X-rays from multiple angles to build detailed cross-sectional images. <dfn class="term" data-def="Magnetic Resonance Imaging.">MRI scans</dfn> (1980s) use magnetic fields to produce even more detailed images of soft tissues, including the brain. Both allow doctors to diagnose conditions without exploratory surgery.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n40">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The journey from R&ouml;ntgen&rsquo;s X-ray (1895) to Marie Curie&rsquo;s mobile units on the WWI battlefield to modern CT and MRI scanners shows how wartime innovation laid the foundations for peacetime technology. Each advance built on the last, transforming what doctors could see, diagnose, and treat.</p>

      <!-- Exam Tip -->
      <div class="exam-tip" data-narration-id="n41">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When writing about war and medical progress, be <strong>specific</strong> about <em>how</em> it led to change. Don&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;war helped medicine.&rdquo; Explain the mechanism: war created <strong>urgency</strong> (millions needed treating), provided <strong>government funding</strong> (e.g., US funding for penicillin), and offered a <strong>testing ground</strong> (e.g., Curie&rsquo;s mobile X-ray units). Always link the wartime advance to its peacetime impact.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n42">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>From Par&eacute; on the Renaissance battlefield to the World Wars, conflict has consistently sped up medical change. Urgency and government funding produced breakthroughs in X-rays, blood transfusions, plastic surgery, and penicillin that transformed both battlefield and civilian medicine. In the modern era, technology has become an equally powerful driver &mdash; from Barnard&rsquo;s first heart transplant to robotic surgery and advanced scanning.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n43">
          <li><strong>War as an accelerator:</strong> Conflict does not <em>create</em> medical knowledge from nothing &mdash; it speeds up progress by providing urgency, funding, and a testing ground.</li>
          <li><strong>A chain of progress:</strong> Each wartime advance built on the last &mdash; Par&eacute;&rsquo;s ligatures, Nightingale&rsquo;s hygiene, Curie&rsquo;s X-ray units, and penicillin mass production all link medieval battlefields to modern operating theatres.</li>
          <li><strong>Technology continues the revolution:</strong> Transplants, keyhole and robotic surgery, and CT/MRI scanning carry forward the progress that war set in motion &mdash; now driven by research rather than conflict.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of aspects of significance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining the relationship between aspects of significance, for example over time.\nExample: The Crimean War was significant because it exposed the catastrophic state of military healthcare and led to lasting reforms. At Scutari, soldiers died from preventable infections, cholera, and dysentery rather than their wounds. Florence Nightingale\u2019s reforms \u2014 scrubbing wards, clean bedding, improved ventilation, and nutritious food \u2014 cut the death rate from 42% to just 2%, proving that hygiene saved lives. Her use of statistical evidence (the \u2018coxcomb\u2019 diagrams) to demonstrate this was groundbreaking \u2014 it showed data could drive medical reform. After the war, Nightingale published Notes on Nursing (1859) and founded the Nightingale Training School (1860), making nursing a respected profession for the first time. Her influence on hospital design (well-ventilated pavilion wards) shaped healthcare for generations. The Crimean War\u2019s significance extends beyond nursing \u2014 it established the principle that clean, well-organised hospitals save lives, a foundation of all modern healthcare.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of aspects of significance. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more aspects of significance.\nExample: The Crimean War was significant because it led to Nightingale\u2019s reforms at Scutari, which cut the death rate from 42% to 2% through improved hygiene. It was also significant because after the war Nightingale founded a training school for nurses, making nursing a profession and improving hospital standards across Britain.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of significance. Students progress from basic explanation by simple reasoning of one identified aspect.\nExample: The Crimean War was significant because Florence Nightingale improved conditions at Scutari hospital. She cleaned the wards and improved food, which reduced the death rate dramatically.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of significance. Students identify aspect(s) relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The Crimean War was important because Florence Nightingale improved nursing.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of similarities. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining complexities of similarities arising from the broader historical context.\nExample: Both Par\u00e9 in the 1500s and WWI surgeons faced new types of injury caused by advances in weaponry, and both were forced to innovate under the pressure of war. Par\u00e9 encountered gunshot wounds for the first time and ran out of boiling oil at the Siege of Turin (1537), accidentally discovering that a salve of egg yolk, rose oil, and turpentine healed better. Similarly, WWI surgeons faced devastating injuries from high-explosive shells and shrapnel, forcing Harold Gillies to pioneer plastic surgery to rebuild soldiers\u2019 faces, and driving the development of the Carrel-Dakin method to combat wound infection. Both also had lasting peacetime impacts that went beyond the immediate battlefield: Par\u00e9\u2019s promotion of ligatures influenced surgery for centuries, and WWI advances in blood transfusions, X-rays, and plastic surgery became standard civilian medical practice. In both cases, the extreme pressures of war drove innovation that would have been unthinkable in peacetime.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of similarities. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more identified similarities.\nExample: Both involved surgeons having to develop new techniques because of new types of war injuries. Par\u00e9 faced gunshot wounds and developed a healing salve and ligatures. WWI surgeons faced shrapnel injuries and developed plastic surgery (Gillies) and wound irrigation (Carrel-Dakin). Both also led to lasting changes in medicine that continued after the wars ended.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one similarity. Students progress from basic explanation by reasoning supported with factual knowledge.\nExample: Both involved doctors having to find new ways to treat war injuries. Par\u00e9 invented a new salve when he ran out of boiling oil, and WWI doctors developed new techniques like plastic surgery because of the terrible injuries caused by shells.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of similarity/similarities. Students identify similarity/similarities relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Both involved treating wounded soldiers during wars.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of similarities. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining complexities of similarities arising from the broader historical context.\nExample: Both World Wars accelerated medical progress through the same mechanisms: massive government funding and the urgent need to treat millions of casualties. In WWI, governments funded Marie Curie\u2019s mobile X-ray units and the development of stored blood transfusions using sodium citrate. In WWII, the US government invested millions in mass-producing penicillin, and established the first blood banks. Both also produced medical advances that transformed civilian healthcare after the wars ended. WWI\u2019s blood transfusion techniques and X-ray technology became routine in civilian hospitals. WWII\u2019s penicillin became the most widely used antibiotic in peacetime medicine. The Emergency Medical Service, set up to coordinate wartime hospitals, directly inspired the NHS (1948). In both cases, wartime urgency compressed decades of potential progress into a few years.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of similarities. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more identified similarities.\nExample: Both wars led to major advances in treating the wounded. WWI saw mobile X-ray units, blood transfusions, and plastic surgery. WWII saw mass production of penicillin and blood banks. Both also led to improvements in public health after the wars \u2014 WWI contributed to the growth of welfare demands, and WWII led directly to the NHS.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one similarity. Students progress from basic explanation by reasoning supported with factual knowledge.\nExample: Both World Wars led to advances in blood transfusion. In WWI, doctors learned to store blood using sodium citrate, and in WWII, blood banks were set up to provide a reliable supply for battlefield casualties.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of similarity/similarities. Students identify similarity/similarities relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Both wars led to medical advances.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: War has been a recurring accelerator of surgical progress but has rarely been the original source of knowledge. Par\u00e9\u2019s discovery of a soothing salve and his promotion of ligatures (Siege of Turin, 1537) came from the battlefield, but his willingness to innovate reflected the Renaissance spirit of questioning authority (individual genius). The Crimean War led to Nightingale\u2019s reforms at Scutari, but her methods drew on observation and data \u2014 scientific thinking applied to nursing. WWI produced mobile X-rays (Curie), blood transfusions, and plastic surgery (Gillies), while WWII drove mass production of penicillin. However, the most fundamental advances in anatomy came from individuals working in peacetime: Vesalius\u2019s anatomical studies (1543) challenged Galen through dissection, and Harvey proved blood circulation (1628). In the modern era, transplant surgery (Barnard, 1967), keyhole surgery (1980s), and robotic surgery (da Vinci, 2000) were driven by technology and science, not war. War compresses timelines and provides urgency and funding, but the underlying scientific knowledge that makes surgical advances possible comes from peacetime research and individual genius.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): War has been very important. Par\u00e9 developed new wound treatments during the siege of Turin. WWI produced mobile X-rays, blood transfusions, and plastic surgery. WWII led to mass production of penicillin and blood banks. Each war drove rapid surgical progress because of the urgency of treating millions of wounded.\nExample (other factor): However, individuals working in peacetime made equally important contributions. Vesalius used dissection to correct Galen\u2019s errors in anatomy (1543). Harvey proved blood circulated through the body (1628). Christiaan Barnard performed the first heart transplant (1967). These advances came from scientific curiosity, not war.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: War helped surgery because it forced doctors to find new ways to treat injuries. In WWI, Harold Gillies developed plastic surgery to rebuild the faces of soldiers who had been injured by shrapnel and burns.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: War helped surgery because doctors had to treat lots of wounded soldiers.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."

Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Science and technology has been the single most consistent driver of surgical progress, but its impact has always depended on other factors. In the medieval period, surgery was primitive because scientific knowledge was limited \u2014 the Church\u2019s ban on dissection (religion) prevented anatomical understanding. The Renaissance brought Vesalius\u2019s anatomical studies (1543) and Par\u00e9\u2019s surgical innovations, but without anaesthetics or antiseptics, surgery remained agonising and often fatal. The 19th century saw three crucial scientific advances: anaesthetics (1842\u20131847) solved pain, Lister\u2019s antiseptic surgery (1867) tackled infection using Pasteur\u2019s Germ Theory, and X-rays (1895) allowed diagnosis without cutting. War accelerated technology\u2019s application: WWI brought mobile X-ray units, blood transfusions, and plastic surgery. WWII drove penicillin mass production, solving post-operative infection at scale. In the modern era, science and technology dominates: CT and MRI scanning (1970s\u20131980s), keyhole surgery, robotic surgery (da Vinci, 2000), and transplant surgery (with immunosuppressant drugs) have transformed what is possible. Throughout, science provides the tools, but war, government funding, and individual genius determine when and how those tools are applied.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Science and technology has been crucial. Anaesthetics (1840s) allowed pain-free surgery. Lister\u2019s antiseptic spray (1867) reduced infection. X-rays (1895) allowed doctors to see inside the body. Modern technology like keyhole surgery and robotic surgery means less pain and faster recovery for patients.\nExample (other factor): However, war has also been very important. WWI led to blood transfusions, mobile X-ray units, and plastic surgery. WWII led to mass production of penicillin. Without war, these technologies might have taken much longer to develop and reach patients.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Science and technology has been important because inventions like anaesthetics and antiseptics made surgery safer. Before anaesthetics, patients had to be held down during operations. Lister\u2019s use of carbolic acid spray reduced deaths from infection.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Science helped surgery because inventions like X-rays helped doctors see inside the body.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Individuals have driven the key breakthroughs in surgery and anatomy across every period, but their success has always depended on the conditions around them. Galen (c.130\u2013210 AD) dominated anatomy for over 1,000 years, but his errors persisted because the Church (religion) banned dissection and enforced his authority. Vesalius (1543) corrected Galen only because the Renaissance allowed questioning and dissection. Par\u00e9 innovated on the battlefield (war) at the Siege of Turin. Harvey proved blood circulation (1628) through observation and experiment (science). In the 19th century, Lister\u2019s antiseptic surgery (1867) depended on Pasteur\u2019s Germ Theory (science and technology). Nightingale transformed nursing after the Crimean War (war). In the modern era, Christiaan Barnard\u2019s heart transplant (1967) required immunosuppressant drugs (science), and Gillies and McIndoe\u2019s plastic surgery was driven by wartime injuries (war). The pattern is consistent: individuals provide the genius and initiative, but war, science, religion, and government create the conditions that determine whether their contributions succeed or fail.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Individuals have been crucial. Vesalius corrected Galen\u2019s anatomical errors through careful dissection (1543). Par\u00e9 developed new wound treatments. Lister introduced antiseptic surgery (1867). Nightingale transformed nursing. Barnard performed the first heart transplant (1967). Harold Gillies pioneered plastic surgery during WWI.\nExample (other factor): However, science and technology has been equally important. Lister could only develop antiseptic surgery because of Pasteur\u2019s Germ Theory. Modern transplant surgery depends on immunosuppressant drugs. Keyhole and robotic surgery depend on advanced cameras and robotic arms. Without technology, individual skill alone is not enough.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Individuals were important because key people made major breakthroughs. Vesalius challenged Galen by dissecting human bodies and publishing accurate anatomical drawings. This corrected errors that had lasted over 1,000 years.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Individuals were important because people like Vesalius and Nightingale made important changes to surgery and nursing.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.
