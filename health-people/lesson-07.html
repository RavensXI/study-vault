        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Introduction: The Speckled Monster</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2"><dfn class="term" data-def="A highly infectious and deadly viral disease that killed around 30% of those who caught it.">Smallpox</dfn> was one of the most feared diseases in 18th-century Britain. It killed around <strong>30% of those who caught it</strong>, and survivors were often left with terrible scarring and sometimes blindness. Preventing it was one of the biggest medical challenges of the age.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">Early Attempts: Inoculation</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Before vaccination, the only way to try to prevent smallpox was <dfn class="term" data-def="The deliberate introduction of a small amount of material from a smallpox sore into a healthy person, hoping to trigger a mild case of the disease and lifelong immunity.">inoculation</dfn>. This was introduced to Britain by <strong>Lady Mary Wortley Montagu</strong>, who had seen it used in Turkey.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">Inoculation involved deliberately infecting a healthy person with a small amount of pus from a <strong>real smallpox sore</strong>. The hope was that they would get a mild dose of the disease and then be immune for life.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n6">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Problems with Inoculation</div>
          <ul data-narration-id="n22">
            <li>It was a <strong>huge gamble</strong> &mdash; some people were successfully immunised, but others caught a deadly dose of smallpox and died.</li>
            <li>Inoculated people could <strong>spread the disease</strong> to others while they were ill.</li>
            <li>It was <strong>expensive</strong>, meaning only the wealthy could afford it.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n7">Jenner&rsquo;s Breakthrough: The First Vaccination</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n8"><strong>Edward Jenner</strong> was a country doctor in Gloucestershire. He had studied under the famous surgeon <strong>John Hunter</strong>, who taught him to test ideas through careful experimentation, famously telling him: <em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think, try.&rdquo;</em> Jenner made a crucial observation: local milkmaids who caught <dfn class="term" data-def="A mild disease caught from infected cows that caused blisters on the hands.">cowpox</dfn> &mdash; a much milder disease caught from cows &mdash; never seemed to catch smallpox.</p>

        <div class="timeline" data-narration-id="n9">
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">1796</div>
            <h4>Jenner tests his theory</h4>
            <p>Jenner took pus from a cowpox sore on a milkmaid named <strong>Sarah Nelmes</strong> and inserted it into a small cut on a young boy called <strong>James Phipps</strong>. James developed a slight fever but was soon well again.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">1796 (weeks later)</div>
            <h4>The crucial test</h4>
            <p>Jenner then inoculated James with <strong>actual smallpox pus</strong>. The boy did not get sick at all &mdash; he was immune. Jenner had proved that cowpox infection protected against smallpox.</p>

          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">1796&ndash;1798</div>
            <h4>Over 20 further tests</h4>
            <p>Jenner carried out <strong>over 20 additional tests</strong> to verify his theory, using the rigorous method he had learned from John Hunter. Only once he was confident did he publish.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">1798</div>
            <h4>Jenner publishes his findings</h4>
            <p>Jenner published his research, calling his new method <dfn class="term" data-def="A method of preventing disease by introducing a harmless form of a disease into the body to trigger immunity.">vaccination</dfn>, from the Latin word for cow, <em>&lsquo;vacca&rsquo;</em>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">1852</div>
            <h4>Vaccination made compulsory</h4>
            <p>After decades of debate, the British government made smallpox vaccination <strong>compulsory</strong> for all children, recognising its life-saving potential.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n10">Opposition and Acceptance</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">Despite its success, Jenner&rsquo;s vaccination faced <strong>strong opposition</strong>. Understanding why people resisted such an effective treatment is important for your exam answers.</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Why did people oppose vaccination?</span>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n12"><strong>Religious objections:</strong> Some believed it was against God&rsquo;s will to put animal matter into a human body. They saw disease as divine punishment and felt vaccination interfered with God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n13"><strong>Mistrust from doctors:</strong> Doctors who earned their living from inoculations opposed vaccination because it threatened their income. Others were sceptical of a treatment from a country doctor rather than a university-trained physician.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n14"><strong>Scientific limitations:</strong> Jenner could <strong>not explain why</strong> his vaccine worked. He had observed its effects but could not describe the biological mechanism. Without <dfn class="term" data-def="The scientific theory, developed by Louis Pasteur in 1861, that specific microscopic organisms (germs/microbes) cause specific diseases.">Germ Theory</dfn> (not published until 1861), this was impossible.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n15"><strong>Fear and misinformation:</strong> Satirical cartoons played on fears about putting animal material into humans. The most famous was by <strong>James Gillray</strong> in <strong>1802</strong>, showing vaccinated people sprouting cow-like features. This is an iconic primary source you may see in exam questions.</p>
              <p><strong>Organised opposition:</strong> The <dfn class="term" data-def="An organised pressure group formed to resist compulsory vaccination in 19th-century Britain.">Anti-Vaccination League</dfn> had around <strong>80,000 members</strong> at its peak. They organised protest marches and once burned an effigy of Jenner. Some doctors performed the technique badly, and when patients died it fuelled further opposition.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n16">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why Vaccination Succeeded</div>
          <p>Despite opposition, the evidence was overwhelming: <strong>vaccination worked</strong>. It was safer than inoculation, cheaper, and could be given to anyone. Jenner&rsquo;s work spread rapidly around the world &mdash; by <strong>1803</strong> the USA was using vaccination, and in <strong>1805</strong> Napoleon ordered the entire French army to be vaccinated. Back in Britain, government support eventually led to vaccination being made <strong>compulsory in 1852</strong>, dramatically reducing smallpox deaths.</p>

          <ul data-narration-id="n23">
            <li><strong>The individual:</strong> Jenner&rsquo;s careful observation of milkmaids and his willingness to test his theory through experiment.</li>
            <li><strong>Science and technology:</strong> His systematic approach to testing &mdash; inoculating James Phipps first with cowpox, then with smallpox &mdash; followed a scientific method.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Publishing his findings allowed other doctors to replicate and verify his results.</li>
            <li><strong>Government:</strong> Parliament awarded Jenner a total of <strong>&pound;30,000</strong> (a huge sum at the time) to continue his research, demonstrating the government factor at play. The decision to make vaccination compulsory in 1852 was crucial for widespread adoption.</li>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When writing about Jenner, think about the <strong>factors</strong> behind his success &mdash; the individual, science, chance (folk knowledge about milkmaids), and government action. Also consider the <strong>limitations</strong>: he could not explain <em>why</em> it worked, and his method only worked for smallpox. A general theory of vaccination did not come until Pasteur and Koch.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n21">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Jenner&rsquo;s work was a major turning point. He created the first-ever vaccine, proving it was possible to <strong>prevent</strong> disease, not just treat it. His method only applied to smallpox and he could not explain the science behind it, but he laid the groundwork for vaccination programmes that would save millions of lives.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n24">
          <li><strong>From inoculation to vaccination:</strong> Inoculation was risky and expensive. Jenner&rsquo;s vaccination used harmless cowpox to create immunity to deadly smallpox &mdash; far safer and more accessible.</li>
          <li><strong>Opposition delayed progress:</strong> Religious objections, doctors&rsquo; self-interest, and Jenner&rsquo;s inability to explain the science all slowed acceptance. Vaccination did not become compulsory until 1852.</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple factors drove success:</strong> Jenner&rsquo;s individual skill, scientific method, publication, and government action all played essential roles.</li>

        pastPaper: "AQA November 2021",
        text: "Explain the significance of the work of Edward Jenner.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of aspects of significance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining the relationship between aspects of significance, for example over time.\nExample: Jenner\u2019s work was significant in the short term because he created the first vaccine, proving it was possible to prevent disease rather than just treat it. His vaccination of James Phipps with cowpox (1796) and subsequent proof of immunity to smallpox established the principle of using a mild disease to protect against a deadly one. However, the long-term significance was even greater: although Jenner could not explain why vaccination worked (Germ Theory was not published until 1861), his method laid the groundwork for Pasteur and Koch to develop vaccines for other diseases like anthrax and cholera in the 1880s. The eventual eradication of smallpox by 1980 was the ultimate consequence of Jenner\u2019s discovery.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of aspects of significance. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more aspects of significance.\nExample: Jenner was significant because he developed the first successful vaccine. He tested his theory by vaccinating James Phipps with cowpox and then exposing him to smallpox \u2014 proving the boy was immune. This was also significant because it led to government action: Parliament gave Jenner \u00a330,000, and vaccination became compulsory in 1852.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of significance. Students progress from basic explanation by simple reasoning of one identified aspect.\nExample: Jenner was significant because he proved vaccination worked. He showed that cowpox could protect against smallpox, which saved many lives and led to the disease being eventually wiped out.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of significance. Students identify aspect(s) relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Jenner created the first vaccine which was important for medicine.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        type: "8 marks \u2014 Explain two similarities",
        pastPaper: "AQA June 2023",
        text: "Explain two ways in which the work of Edward Jenner and Robert Koch was similar.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of similarities. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining complexities of similarities arising from the broader historical context.\nExample: Both Jenner and Koch relied on systematic experimentation, but the broader context of their similarity is that both needed to overcome resistance from the medical establishment. Jenner faced opposition from inoculation doctors who stood to lose income, and Koch had to persuade sceptics who still believed in spontaneous generation. Both succeeded because they provided repeatable evidence: Jenner carried out over 20 tests before publishing, while Koch developed methods (agar plates, staining, photography) that allowed any scientist to verify his identification of specific disease-causing bacteria. Both also benefited from government support \u2014 Jenner received \u00a330,000 from Parliament, and Koch\u2019s research was funded by the German government.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of similarities. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more identified similarities.\nExample: One similarity is that both used careful experiments to prove their ideas. Jenner tested his vaccine on James Phipps by first giving him cowpox and then exposing him to smallpox, carrying out over 20 tests before publishing. Koch similarly used experiments \u2014 injecting mice with anthrax bacteria to prove specific germs caused specific diseases. Another similarity is that both men\u2019s work led to practical methods of fighting specific diseases: Jenner\u2019s vaccine prevented smallpox, and Koch\u2019s identification of bacteria allowed the development of targeted treatments.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one similarity. Students progress from basic explanation by reasoning supported with factual knowledge.\nExample: Both Jenner and Koch used experiments in their work. Jenner vaccinated James Phipps and then tested him with smallpox. Koch injected mice with bacteria to see if they became ill.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of similarity/similarities. Students identify similarity/similarities relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Both Jenner and Koch did experiments to prove their ideas worked.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        type: "8 marks \u2014 Explain the significance",
        text: "Explain the significance of government action in the development of vaccination.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of aspects of significance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining the relationship between aspects of significance, for example over time.\nExample: Government action was significant because it turned Jenner\u2019s individual discovery into a national public health measure. Parliament initially awarded Jenner \u00a330,000 to continue his research, signalling official endorsement. However, the most significant government action was making vaccination compulsory in 1852 \u2014 this forced widespread adoption despite continued opposition from the Anti-Vaccination League (80,000 members). This set a precedent: the government accepted responsibility for public health, paving the way for the compulsory 1875 Public Health Act and eventually the NHS in 1948. Without government action, vaccination would have remained optional and smallpox deaths would have continued for much longer.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of aspects of significance. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more aspects of significance.\nExample: Government action was significant in two ways. First, Parliament gave Jenner \u00a330,000 to support his work, showing official recognition. Second, vaccination was made compulsory in 1852, meaning all children had to be vaccinated. This dramatically reduced smallpox deaths and set a precedent for government involvement in public health.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of significance. Students progress from basic explanation by simple reasoning of one identified aspect.\nExample: Government action was significant because vaccination was made compulsory in 1852. This meant everyone had to be vaccinated, which helped reduce smallpox deaths across the country.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of significance. Students identify aspect(s) relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The government helped vaccination by making it compulsory.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        text: "Has chance been the main factor in the development of medicine in Britain? Explain your answer with reference to chance and other factors. Use a range of examples from across your study of Health and the people: c1000 to the present day.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Chance played a role at key moments but was never sufficient on its own \u2014 it always needed a prepared mind to exploit it. Jenner\u2019s observation that milkmaids who caught cowpox did not get smallpox could be seen as chance (folk knowledge he happened to notice), but it was his scientific training under John Hunter that led him to test it rigorously with over 20 experiments. Fleming\u2019s discovery of penicillin (1928) was accidental \u2014 mould contaminated a petri dish \u2014 but it took Florey and Chain\u2019s ten years of systematic work and US government wartime investment to make it a usable drug. Conversely, major breakthroughs like Pasteur\u2019s Germ Theory (1861) and Koch\u2019s identification of specific bacteria owed little to chance and everything to deliberate scientific method. Government action (1875 Public Health Act, NHS 1948) and science/technology (microscopes, X-rays) were more consistently important across the whole period.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Chance was important at several points. Jenner\u2019s knowledge of the folk belief about milkmaids was partly accidental. Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928 when mould blew onto a petri dish he had left uncovered. Simpson discovered chloroform\u2019s anaesthetic properties when a bottle was knocked over during dinner.\nExample (other factor): Science and technology was more important overall. Pasteur\u2019s Germ Theory (1861) was the result of deliberate experiment, not chance. Koch developed specific techniques (agar plates, staining) to identify bacteria. Improved microscopes enabled scientists to see germs for the first time. These systematic advances drove the biggest changes in medicine.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Chance was important because Fleming discovered penicillin by accident in 1928 when mould contaminated his petri dish. Without this lucky accident, penicillin might not have been discovered.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Chance was important because some discoveries happened by accident. / Science was more important because scientists planned their experiments.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."

        text: "Has science and technology been the main factor in the development of medicine in Britain? Explain your answer with reference to science and technology and other factors. Use a range of examples from across your study of Health and the people: c1000 to the present day.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Science and technology became increasingly important over time, but their impact depended on other factors. In the medieval period, the Church\u2019s control of education meant scientific thinking was suppressed \u2014 Galen\u2019s ideas went unchallenged for centuries. During the Renaissance, improved printing technology helped spread Vesalius\u2019s anatomical discoveries, but progress was slow without microscopes. By the 19th century, improved microscopes enabled Pasteur\u2019s Germ Theory (1861) and Koch\u2019s identification of bacteria \u2014 but Koch also needed government funding and the rivalry with France to drive progress. Jenner\u2019s vaccine (1796) was based on observation rather than scientific understanding \u2014 he could not explain why it worked. In the 20th century, technology was central: X-rays (1895), penicillin mass production (WWII), and DNA discovery all transformed medicine, but required government investment and wartime urgency.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Science and technology was important because key breakthroughs depended on it. Improved microscopes allowed Koch to see and photograph bacteria. Pasteur\u2019s swan-necked flask experiment (1861) proved germs caused decay using scientific method. X-rays (1895) let doctors see inside the body for the first time.\nExample (other factor): The role of the individual was also crucial. Without Jenner\u2019s willingness to test his cowpox theory, vaccination would not exist. Without Pasteur\u2019s curiosity, Germ Theory might have been delayed. Individuals drove the key discoveries that science and technology then enabled.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Science and technology was important because better microscopes allowed scientists to see bacteria. Koch used this technology to identify the germs that caused anthrax, TB, and cholera.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Science helped medicine because microscopes let people see germs.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."

        text: "Has government been the main factor in the development of medicine in Britain? Explain your answer with reference to government and other factors. Use a range of examples from across your study of Health and the people: c1000 to the present day.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Government\u2019s role changed dramatically over time. In the medieval period, the government played almost no role in medicine \u2014 the Church and individuals drove what progress there was. During the Renaissance, Henry VIII\u2019s break with Rome weakened Church control but the government did not actively promote medical research. A turning point came in the 19th century: Parliament funded Jenner (\u00a330,000), made vaccination compulsory (1852), and passed the 1875 Public Health Act forcing councils to provide clean water and sewers. However, these actions depended on individuals (Chadwick, Snow) and science (Germ Theory) to provide the evidence. In the 20th century, government became central: wartime funding mass-produced penicillin, and the NHS (1948) made healthcare free and universal. Government was most important in the modern period, but earlier progress depended more on individuals and science.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Government was important because it turned individual discoveries into nationwide change. Parliament funded Jenner\u2019s research and made vaccination compulsory in 1852. The 1875 Public Health Act forced councils to provide clean water, sewers, and medical officers. The NHS (1948) gave everyone access to healthcare.\nExample (other factor): Individuals were also essential. Without Jenner\u2019s observation and experiment, there would have been no vaccine for the government to promote. Without Chadwick\u2019s report (1842) and Snow\u2019s investigation (1854), the evidence for public health reform would not have existed.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Government was important because they made vaccination compulsory in 1852. This meant all children had to be vaccinated against smallpox, which dramatically reduced deaths.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Government helped by passing laws about public health. / Individuals were important because they made discoveries.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.
