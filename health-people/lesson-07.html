        <p data-narration-id="n2"><dfn class="term" data-def="A highly infectious and deadly viral disease that killed around 30% of those who caught it. Survivors were often left with severe scarring (pockmarks) and sometimes blindness. It was one of the most feared diseases in history until it was eradicated by vaccination in 1980.">Smallpox</dfn> was one of the most feared diseases in 18th-century Britain. It killed around <strong>30% of those who caught it</strong>, and survivors were often left with terrible scarring and sometimes blindness. Finding a way to prevent this devastating disease was one of the most important medical challenges of the age.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">Early Attempts: Inoculation</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Before vaccination, the only way to try and prevent smallpox was a method called <dfn class="term" data-def="The deliberate introduction of a small amount of material from a smallpox sore into a healthy person, hoping to trigger a mild case of the disease and lifelong immunity. It was risky because some people developed full-blown smallpox and died.">inoculation</dfn>. This technique was introduced to Britain by <strong>Lady Mary Wortley Montagu</strong>, who had seen it used in Turkey.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">Inoculation involved deliberately infecting a healthy person with a small amount of pus from a <strong>real smallpox sore</strong>. The hope was that they would get a mild dose of the disease and then be immune for life.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n6">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Problems with Inoculation</div>
          <ul>
            <li>It was a <strong>huge gamble</strong> &mdash; some people were successfully immunised, but others caught a deadly dose of smallpox and died.</li>
            <li>Inoculated people could <strong>spread the disease</strong> to others while they were ill.</li>
            <li>It was <strong>expensive</strong>, meaning only the wealthy could afford it.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n7">Jenner&rsquo;s Breakthrough: The First Vaccination</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n8"><strong>Edward Jenner</strong> was a country doctor in Gloucestershire. He made a crucial observation: local milkmaids who caught <dfn class="term" data-def="A mild disease caught from infected cows that caused blisters on the hands. Crucially, those who caught cowpox seemed to become immune to the much more deadly smallpox. Jenner used this observation to develop the first vaccine.">cowpox</dfn> &mdash; a much milder disease caught from cows &mdash; never seemed to catch smallpox. This observation, based on local folk knowledge, would lead to one of the most important breakthroughs in medical history.</p>

            <h4>Jenner tests his theory</h4>
            <p>Jenner took pus from a cowpox sore on a milkmaid named <strong>Sarah Nelmes</strong> and inserted it into a small cut on a young boy called <strong>James Phipps</strong>. James developed a slight fever but was soon well again.</p>

            <p>Jenner then inoculated James with <strong>actual smallpox pus</strong>. The boy did not get sick at all &mdash; he was immune. Jenner had proved that cowpox infection protected against smallpox.</p>

            <p>Jenner published his research, calling his new method <dfn class="term" data-def="A method of preventing disease by introducing a harmless form of a disease into the body to trigger immunity. The word comes from the Latin 'vacca' meaning cow, because Jenner's first vaccine used cowpox to protect against smallpox.">vaccination</dfn>, from the Latin word for cow, <em>&lsquo;vacca&rsquo;</em>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">Despite its success, Jenner&rsquo;s vaccination faced <strong>significant opposition</strong> from several quarters. Understanding why people resisted such an effective treatment is important for your exam answers.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n12"><strong>Religious objections:</strong> Some people believed it was against God&rsquo;s will to deliberately put animal matter into a human body. They saw disease as divine punishment and felt vaccination was interfering with God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n13"><strong>Mistrust from doctors:</strong> Many doctors who made their living from performing inoculations opposed vaccination because it threatened their income. Others were genuinely sceptical of a treatment developed by a country doctor rather than a university-trained physician.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n14"><strong>Scientific limitations:</strong> At the time, Jenner could <strong>not explain why</strong> his vaccine worked. He had observed its effects but could not describe the biological mechanism behind it.

          <ul>

            <li><strong>Science and technology:</strong> His systematic approach to testing &mdash; inoculating James Phipps first with cowpox, then with smallpox &mdash; followed a scientific method.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Publishing his findings allowed other doctors to replicate and verify his results.</li>
            <li><strong>Government:</strong> The decision to make vaccination compulsory in 1852 was crucial for widespread adoption.</li>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When writing about Jenner, think about the <strong>factors</strong> that led to his success &mdash; the role of the individual, science, chance (local folk knowledge about milkmaids), and government action. Also consider the <strong>limitations</strong>: Jenner could not explain <em>why</em> his vaccine worked, and his method only worked for smallpox, not other diseases. It was not until Pasteur and Koch that a general theory of vaccination could be developed.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n21">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Edward Jenner&rsquo;s work was a massive turning point in the history of medicine. He created the first-ever vaccine, proving that it was possible to <strong>prevent</strong> disease rather than just treating it after the fact. Although his method only applied to smallpox and he could not explain the science behind it, his approach laid the groundwork for the vaccination programmes that would save millions of lives in the centuries to come.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>From inoculation to vaccination:</strong> Inoculation was risky and expensive. Jenner&rsquo;s vaccination used harmless cowpox to create immunity to deadly smallpox &mdash; a far safer and more accessible method.</li>
          <li><strong>Opposition delayed progress:</strong> Religious objections, doctors&rsquo; self-interest, and Jenner&rsquo;s inability to explain the science behind his vaccine all slowed acceptance. It took until 1852 for vaccination to become compulsory.</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple factors drove success:</strong> Jenner&rsquo;s individual genius, scientific method, communication through publication, and eventual government action all played essential roles in making vaccination a reality.</li>
