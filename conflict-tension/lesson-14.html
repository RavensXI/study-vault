        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The Final Target: Poland</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">With the Nazi-Soviet Pact securing his eastern flank, Hitler was ready to turn on Poland. He demanded the return of <dfn class="term" data-def="A port city on the Baltic Sea with a predominantly German-speaking population. After World War One, the Treaty of Versailles made it a 'Free City' under League of Nations protection. Hitler demanded its return to Germany in 1939.">Danzig</dfn> (a &ldquo;Free City&rdquo; under the League of Nations with a majority German population) and the abolition of the <dfn class="term" data-def="A strip of territory granted to Poland by the Treaty of Versailles, giving Poland access to the Baltic Sea. It separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany and was a major source of German resentment.">Polish Corridor</dfn> &mdash; the strip of land that separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">Poland stood firm. Unlike Czechoslovakia, Poland had a clear <strong>guarantee from Britain and France</strong> that they would come to its defence. Hitler gambled that &mdash; as with previous crises &mdash; the Western powers would back down. This time, he was wrong.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">The Gleiwitz Incident</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">On <strong>31 August 1939</strong>, German SS troops staged a <dfn class="term" data-def="A false flag operation on 31 August 1939 in which German SS soldiers disguised themselves as Polish troops and staged a fake attack on a German radio station near the Polish border. It was used by Nazi Germany as a manufactured pretext to justify the invasion of Poland.">Gleiwitz Incident</dfn> &mdash; a false flag operation. German soldiers dressed in Polish uniforms attacked a German radio station near the border. They even left behind the body of a concentration camp prisoner dressed as a Polish soldier to make it look authentic.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n6">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The Gleiwitz Incident was a <strong>manufactured pretext</strong> &mdash; Hitler needed an excuse to present the invasion as a defensive response to &ldquo;Polish aggression.&rdquo; In reality, every detail was orchestrated by the SS under orders from Berlin. The invasion plan had been prepared weeks in advance.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n7">The Invasion of Poland</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">On <strong>1 September 1939</strong>, Germany launched a devastating invasion of Poland using <dfn class="term" data-def="Meaning 'Lightning War' in German. A military tactic involving rapid, concentrated attacks using tanks, motorised infantry, and close air support to break through enemy lines and encircle defenders before they can respond. Germany used Blitzkrieg to devastating effect in Poland in September 1939.">Blitzkrieg</dfn> &mdash; &ldquo;Lightning War.&rdquo; This was a new form of warfare that combined speed, technology, and overwhelming force.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n9">Blitzkrieg relied on coordinated attacks from air and ground. <dfn class="term" data-def="German tanks used extensively in World War Two. Panzer divisions were the spearhead of Blitzkrieg tactics, breaking through enemy lines with speed and armoured firepower.">Panzers</dfn> (tanks) smashed through Polish defences in concentrated armoured columns, while <dfn class="term" data-def="The Junkers Ju 87 dive-bomber, known for its terrifying siren. Stukas provided close air support during Blitzkrieg, destroying enemy positions, supply lines, and morale ahead of the advancing ground forces.">Stukas</dfn> (dive-bombers) destroyed communications, supply lines, and troop concentrations from the air.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n10">The Polish army, though brave, was overwhelmed. Much of its forces relied on horse-mounted cavalry and outdated equipment, which stood no chance against German armoured divisions and air power. The speed of the German advance meant Poland could not organise an effective defence.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">On <strong>17 September</strong>, the Soviet Red Army invaded Poland from the east &mdash; honouring the secret clause of the Nazi-Soviet Pact. Caught between two invading armies, Poland&rsquo;s position was hopeless. <strong>Warsaw surrendered on 27 September.</strong> Poland was divided between Germany and the USSR.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n12">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Poland&rsquo;s Fate</div>
          <p>Poland was crushed in just <strong>four weeks</strong>. The country ceased to exist as an independent state, divided between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union exactly as the secret protocol of the Nazi-Soviet Pact had stipulated. It would not regain full independence until 1989.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n13">Britain and France Declare War</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">On <strong>2 September 1939</strong>, Britain and France issued an <dfn class="term" data-def="A final demand or set of conditions issued by one party to another, with a threat of serious consequences (such as war) if the conditions are not met by a specified deadline.">ultimatum</dfn> to Germany: withdraw all forces from Poland by <strong>11:00 am on 3 September</strong>, or Britain and France would declare war.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">Hitler ignored the deadline. At <strong>11:15 am on 3 September 1939</strong>, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n16">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Chamberlain&rsquo;s Broadcast</div>
          <p>&ldquo;I am speaking to you from the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street. This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note stating that, unless we heard from them by 11 o&rsquo;clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us. I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently <strong>this country is at war with Germany</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">France declared war on Germany later the same day. The guarantee to Poland had been honoured. After a decade of tension, failed diplomacy, and appeasement, Europe was once again at war.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When assessing responsibility for the outbreak of war, focus on <strong>key individuals&rsquo; roles</strong>. Hitler&rsquo;s aggression was the primary and most direct cause &mdash; he planned the invasion, manufactured the pretext, and launched the attack. But also consider how Stalin&rsquo;s decision to sign the Nazi-Soviet Pact made the invasion <strong>possible</strong> by removing the threat of a two-front war. The best answers weigh both immediate and enabling causes.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n21">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The invasion of Poland was the direct and immediate cause of World War Two. Blitzkrieg and the Soviet invasion from the east sealed Poland&rsquo;s fate within four weeks. Britain and France honoured their guarantee, ending a decade of tension, failed collective security, and appeasement with a declaration of war.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Gleiwitz Incident was a calculated lie:</strong> Hitler manufactured a pretext to justify the invasion, showing that the attack on Poland was premeditated aggression, not a defensive response &mdash; this is crucial evidence when assessing blame for the outbreak of war.</li>
          <li><strong>Blitzkrieg changed warfare:</strong> The coordinated use of Panzers, Stukas, and motorised infantry overwhelmed Poland in four weeks &mdash; a speed of conquest that shocked the world and demonstrated Germany&rsquo;s terrifying military capability.</li>
          <li><strong>Britain and France finally acted:</strong> After years of appeasement and broken promises, the guarantee to Poland was honoured &mdash; but the delay in confronting Hitler had allowed him to grow far stronger than he might otherwise have been.</li>
        </ul>
