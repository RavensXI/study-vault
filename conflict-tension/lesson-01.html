        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The Big Three</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The <dfn class="term" data-def="The peace treaty signed in June 1919 that officially ended World War One between Germany and the Allied Powers.">Treaty of Versailles</dfn> was shaped by three leaders with very different goals. Understanding their clashing aims is key to explaining why the treaty ended up the way it did.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The &ldquo;<dfn class="term" data-def="The nickname for the three leaders who dominated the Paris Peace Conference: David Lloyd George of Britain, Georges Clemenceau of France, and Woodrow Wilson of the USA.">Big Three</dfn>&rdquo; were <strong>David Lloyd George</strong> of Britain, <strong>Georges Clemenceau</strong> of France, and <strong>Woodrow Wilson</strong> of the USA. Germany was not invited. Although 32 nations attended the <dfn class="term" data-def="The meeting of victorious Allied nations held in Paris from January 1919 to negotiate the peace treaties ending World War One.">Paris Peace Conference</dfn> from January 1919, and Italy made it a &ldquo;Big Four,&rdquo; Italy was virtually ignored &mdash; so in reality it was the Big Three who decided the treaty over six months of talks.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n4">David Lloyd George (Britain)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n5"><strong>David Lloyd George</strong> won re-election in 1918 using slogans like &ldquo;Hang the Kaiser,&rdquo; &ldquo;Make Germany Pay,&rdquo; and &ldquo;squeeze the German lemon till the pips squeak.&rdquo; Almost a million British soldiers had died, so the public demanded harsh punishment. Privately, though, Lloyd George knew that crippling Germany would hurt British trade &mdash; before the war, Germany had been one of Britain&rsquo;s biggest trading partners. He was a practical deal-maker, caught between Clemenceau&rsquo;s desire for revenge and Wilson&rsquo;s idealism.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n7">He was suspicious of the League of Nations &mdash; he did not want it to have its own army, in case it gained power over Britain. He supported peace because it was good for business, but always looked for practical deals rather than grand ideals.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n8">His middle-ground approach aimed to punish Germany enough to satisfy voters while keeping it strong enough to trade with &mdash; and to act as a buffer against the spread of <dfn class="term" data-def="The communist political movement that took power in Russia after the 1917 Revolution.">Bolshevism</dfn> from the east.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">Georges Clemenceau (France)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10"><strong>Georges Clemenceau</strong> &mdash; nicknamed &ldquo;The Tiger&rdquo; &mdash; was 77 when the conference began. He had been just 29 when Germany invaded France in 1871, so in his lifetime Germany had invaded his homeland <em>twice</em>. His son was wounded in the war. He wanted revenge: high <dfn class="term" data-def="Financial compensation demanded from Germany by the Allied Powers for the damage caused during World War One.">reparations</dfn>, the return of Alsace-Lorraine, the Rhineland demilitarised, and ideally Germany broken up into smaller states.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>France had suffered huge damage &mdash; much of the fighting on the <dfn class="term" data-def="The main theatre of war in Western Europe during World War One, stretching from Belgium through north-eastern France.">Western Front</dfn> took place on French soil. Over <strong>1.4 million French soldiers</strong> were killed, and large areas of northern France were destroyed. Clemenceau wanted Germany to pay for all of it. He also wanted the League of Nations to have its own army to protect France from any future attack.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n12">Woodrow Wilson (USA)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n13"><strong>Woodrow Wilson</strong> was an idealist. The USA had only joined the war in 1917 and suffered around 100,000 casualties &mdash; far fewer than Britain or France &mdash; with no damage to American soil. Wilson had a poor opinion of empires and wanted a fair, &ldquo;just&rdquo; peace through his <dfn class="term" data-def="A list of 14 principles published by President Wilson in January 1918 as a basis for ending the war fairly.">Fourteen Points</dfn>. He worried that punishing Germany too harshly would only create a desire for revenge. However, American <dfn class="term" data-def="A policy of avoiding involvement in the political affairs of other countries.">isolationism</dfn> meant many at home wanted nothing to do with Europe&rsquo;s problems.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Key Disagreements</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Land:</strong> Clemenceau wanted to break Germany into smaller states. Wilson and Lloyd George blocked this, fearing it would cause future wars.</li>
            <li><strong>Reparations &amp; trade:</strong> Clemenceau wanted to cripple Germany financially. Lloyd George wanted to keep Germany strong enough to buy British goods &mdash; Germany had been Britain&rsquo;s second biggest trade partner before the war.</li>
            <li><strong>The League of Nations:</strong> Clemenceau wanted the League to have its own army to protect France. Lloyd George did not &mdash; he feared it would interfere with the British Empire. Wilson wanted an army to help keep the peace.</li>
            <li><strong>Disarmament:</strong> Wilson wanted <em>all</em> countries to disarm. Clemenceau only wanted Germany to disarm.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-determination:</strong> Wilson wanted every ethnic group to rule itself. Lloyd George feared this would threaten the British Empire. Both Britain and France used the idea to grab German colonies instead.</li>

              <p data-narration-id="n20">Wilson was widely seen as arrogant and too idealistic. Clemenceau mocked him: <strong>&ldquo;Mr. Wilson bores me with his Fourteen Points; why, God Almighty has only Ten!&rdquo;</strong> Wilson thought the USA had &ldquo;won&rdquo; the war and took the moral high ground, but he would not listen to others.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n21">His biggest blind spot was <strong>self-determination</strong>. Eastern Europe&rsquo;s ethnic groups were hopelessly mixed together &mdash; for example, Austria-Hungary alone had dozens of nationalities living side by side. Drawing neat borders along ethnic lines was impossible. Many Germans ended up living outside Germany, storing up problems for the future. Britain and France also had huge empires with many colonies, so self-determination threatened their own power too.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">When Wilson published his Fourteen Points in <strong>January 1918</strong>, Germany ignored them and kept fighting. But after defeat in <strong>November 1918</strong>, Germany accepted the <dfn class="term" data-def="An agreement to stop fighting.">Armistice</dfn> expecting a fair peace based on those same points.

        <p>Abbreviate long terms after defining them once &mdash; e.g. write &ldquo;Treaty of Versailles (ToV)&rdquo; then use &ldquo;ToV&rdquo; throughout. Also, when explaining disagreements, always link each leader&rsquo;s aim back to <em>why</em> they wanted it (e.g. Clemenceau&rsquo;s demand for reparations came from France being invaded twice).</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n29">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Big Three each had different aims shaped by their own country&rsquo;s experience of the war. Wilson&rsquo;s Fourteen Points raised hopes of a fair peace, but Clemenceau and Lloyd George had other priorities. The result was a compromise that left nobody satisfied.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Every clause was a compromise:</strong> Clemenceau wanted revenge, Wilson wanted fairness, and Lloyd George wanted trade &mdash; each had to give ground, leaving all three unhappy.</li>
          <li><strong>Germany expected a fair peace but got a harsh one:</strong> Germany accepted the Armistice based on the Fourteen Points. The final treaty was far tougher, creating a lasting sense of betrayal.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-determination caused as many problems as it solved:</strong> Eastern Europe&rsquo;s mixed ethnic groups made neat borders impossible, leaving millions of Germans outside Germany and storing up future conflict.</li>

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of how/why different problems interacted and affected the outcome.\nExample: The problems facing the peacemakers were interconnected. Wilson\u2019s Fourteen Points had raised expectations of a fair peace, but Clemenceau\u2019s demand for French security made many of them impossible to implement. This created a dilemma for Lloyd George, who privately favoured moderation but faced public pressure at home to \u2018Make Germany Pay\u2019. The collapse of European empires added further complexity \u2014 redrawing borders to satisfy self-determination often conflicted with strategic and economic needs.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why one problem affected the process.\nExample: One major problem was that the Big Three had very different aims. Clemenceau wanted to punish Germany and protect France because France had been invaded twice and suffered 1.4 million deaths. Wilson wanted a fair peace based on his Fourteen Points. These competing aims led to lengthy arguments and forced compromises that left no one fully satisfied.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: The peacemakers faced the problem of public pressure. In Britain, the public wanted Germany to be punished harshly. Newspapers ran campaigns demanding high reparations. This made it difficult for Lloyd George to push for a moderate peace.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: The leaders all wanted different things from the peace settlement. / There was pressure from the public to punish Germany.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of how the significance of the Fourteen Points changed at different stages of the conference.\nExample: The Fourteen Points initially raised expectations for a fair peace \u2014 Germany surrendered partly on this basis. However, at the conference Clemenceau dismissed them, reportedly saying \u2018even God Almighty only had Ten\u2019. Wilson was forced to compromise on many points to secure agreement for the League of Nations, which he saw as the most important. This meant Germany received a much harsher treaty than expected, fuelling the \u2018stab in the back\u2019 myth and lasting resentment.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Structured, well-ordered narrative with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how the points affected one stage of the process.\nExample: The Fourteen Points affected the conference because they created disagreements between the leaders. Wilson wanted self-determination for all peoples and no secret treaties, but Clemenceau argued that France\u2019s security required control of the Rhineland and Saarland. Wilson had to abandon several of his points in order to get Clemenceau and Lloyd George to agree to the creation of the League of Nations.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Wilson brought his Fourteen Points to the conference. They included ideas like self-determination and free trade. But the other leaders did not agree with all of them and most of the points were not included in the final treaty.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: Wilson had Fourteen Points that he wanted to use to make peace. / The other leaders did not all agree with Wilson\u2019s ideas.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

Clemenceau\u2019s insistence on punishing Germany was driven by France having been invaded twice and suffering 1.4 million deaths, while Lloyd George had to balance his private desire for moderation against a British public demanding harsh terms. Wilson\u2019s idealism clashed with both \u2014 he was willing to compromise on reparations and territorial losses in order to secure the League of Nations, which Clemenceau only accepted in exchange for the War Guilt Clause and military restrictions.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Structured, well-ordered narrative with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how one leader\u2019s aims affected the settlement.\nExample: Clemenceau\u2019s aims affected the settlement because he wanted to weaken Germany permanently. France had suffered enormous destruction during the war and Clemenceau wanted high reparations, the return of Alsace-Lorraine, and the demilitarisation of the Rhineland. His determination led to many of the harshest terms in the treaty, including the \u00a36.6 billion reparations bill.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Lloyd George was caught in the middle at the conference. He wanted a moderate peace to allow trade with Germany to continue, but the British public wanted Germany to be punished. He ended up supporting some harsh terms like reparations.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: The three leaders all wanted different things. / Clemenceau wanted to punish Germany but Wilson wanted a fair peace.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: The military terms were humiliating but were not the main reason Germany hated the treaty. What Germans hated most was the \u2018Diktat\u2019 \u2014 they were excluded from negotiations and forced to sign under threat of invasion. This meant they could not prevent the inclusion of Clause 231 (War Guilt), which they saw as a lie that justified all other punishments. The military restrictions (army of 100,000, no air force, no submarines, Rhineland demilitarised) were a consequence of this enforced guilt.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The military terms were hated because Germany\u2019s army was cut to 100,000 men, they could have no air force or submarines, and the Rhineland was demilitarised. This left Germany defenceless and was humiliating for a country that had prided itself on its military strength.\nExample (other factor): The reparations bill of \u00a36.6 billion was another reason Germans hated the treaty. People were already suffering from starvation after the war, and the bill was so huge it was estimated to take over 60 years to pay. Germans felt this was unfair as they did not believe they alone caused the war.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The territorial losses were hated because Germany lost 10% of its land. The Polish Corridor split Germany in two and Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France. Germany also lost all its overseas colonies.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Germany was forced to reduce the size of its army. / Germany lost a lot of land. / Germany had to pay reparations.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: The loss of territory was not the main reason because Germany expected some losses. What they hated most was that Germany was excluded from the negotiations and it was a \u2018Diktat\u2019. This meant they could not influence the severity of the resulting terms. This meant they could not prevent the inclusion of Clause 231 concerning war guilt which said they were responsible for starting the war.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The territorial terms were the main reason Germans hated the treaty because they were humiliating and economically damaging. 10% of its land was given to neighbouring countries. A strip of land was given to Poland which split Germany in two by creating a corridor to the sea. Germany also lost control of the coal-rich Saarland (League mandate for 15 years) and the Rhineland was demilitarised.\nExample (other factor): The reparations payments were another reason Germans hated the treaty because they would make recovery harder. People were suffering from starvation after the war, and the \u00a36.6 billion bill was so huge it was estimated to take over 60 years to pay back.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The War Guilt Clause was hated because it forced Germany to accept full blame for starting the war.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: Reparations were deeply resented but were not the main reason Germany objected. The underlying cause of German hatred was the \u2018Diktat\u2019 nature of the treaty \u2014 Germany was excluded from negotiations and forced to sign. This lack of voice meant they could not challenge Clause 231 (War Guilt), which they saw as a lie and which morally justified every other punishment including the reparations themselves.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning.

People were already starving after the war and the sum was estimated to take over 60 years to repay. Germans felt this was unjust because they did not believe they bore sole responsibility for the war.\nExample (other factor): The military restrictions were another reason Germany objected. The army was capped at 100,000 men with no air force or submarines, and the Rhineland was demilitarised.
