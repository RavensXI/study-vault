        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Who Was to Blame?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">World War Two was not caused by one person or one event. It grew from <strong>twenty years of tension</strong> &mdash; flawed treaties, failed institutions, and bad decisions on all sides. The best exam answers show war had <strong>multiple, connected causes</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Four Arguments</div>
          <p>Examiners organise responsibility for WWII around <strong>four main arguments</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hitler</strong> &mdash; the most direct cause</li>
            <li><strong>Chamberlain &amp; Appeasement</strong> &mdash; encouraged aggression</li>
            <li><strong>Stalin &amp; the Nazi-Soviet Pact</strong> &mdash; removed the last barrier to invasion</li>
            <li><strong>Wider Factors</strong> &mdash; Treaty of Versailles, League failure, Great Depression</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Argument 1: Hitler Was Responsible</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">This is the most direct argument. Hitler&rsquo;s aims, set out in <dfn class="term" data-def="Meaning 'My Struggle' in German, this was Adolf Hitler's autobiographical manifesto published in 1925. It set out his political ideology, including anti-Semitism, the need for Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe, and the destruction of Communism.">Mein Kampf</dfn> (1925), could <strong>not</strong> be achieved without war. He wanted to overturn the <dfn class="term" data-def="The peace treaty signed in June 1919 that officially ended World War One between Germany and the Allied Powers. It imposed harsh terms on Germany including territorial losses, military restrictions, reparations, and the War Guilt Clause.">Treaty of Versailles</dfn>, unite all German speakers, seize <dfn class="term" data-def="German for 'living space.' Hitler's policy of expanding German territory eastward, particularly into Poland and the Soviet Union, to provide land and resources for the German people.">Lebensraum</dfn> in the east, and destroy Communism. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A record of a secret meeting in November 1937 between Hitler and his top military leaders. Hitler outlined plans to expand eastward by attacking Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. It is key evidence that Hitler had planned aggression well before 1939.">Hossbach Memorandum</dfn> (1937) confirmed these plans. In a secret meeting with his generals, Hitler said Germany could only get the raw materials it needed by <strong>expanding east</strong>. He named Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Lithuania as targets, and said this must happen as soon as possible. War with Britain was to be avoided &mdash; but war itself was inevitable.</p>

            <span>The case against Hitler in detail</span>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n6">Hitler broke every agreement he made. He rearmed Germany, remilitarised the Rhineland, carried out Anschluss with Austria, seized the Sudetenland, invaded Czechoslovakia, and finally invaded Poland. He also built alliances &mdash; the <strong>Rome&ndash;Berlin Axis</strong> (1936) with Italy, the <strong>Anti-Comintern Pact</strong> (1936) with Japan, and the <strong>Pact of Steel</strong> (1939) with Italy &mdash; making Germany stronger at each step.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n7">Each move was calculated. He tested Britain and France and found them weak. The invasion of Poland was the <strong>direct cause</strong> of war &mdash; Hitler planned it, manufactured the Gleiwitz pretext, and gave the order.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n8">Historians debate whether Hitler had a <strong>master plan</strong> from the start (the &ldquo;intentionalist&rdquo; view) or was an <strong>opportunist</strong> who seized chances as they came (the &ldquo;structuralist&rdquo; view). The Hossbach Memorandum supports the intentionalist view. Either way, his actions were the main driver of war.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n9">Argument 2: Chamberlain &amp; Appeasement</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">Hitler was the aggressor &mdash; but the policy of <dfn class="term" data-def="The policy pursued by Britain and France in the 1930s of making concessions to aggressive powers (especially Nazi Germany) in the hope of avoiding war. It is most closely associated with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.">appeasement</dfn> by Britain and France <strong>encouraged</strong> him. By giving in again and again, the Western powers told Hitler that aggression would be rewarded and that they lacked the will to fight.</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>How appeasement contributed to war</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n11">The Munich Agreement (1938) is the clearest example. Britain and France let Hitler take the Sudetenland without a fight, betraying Czechoslovakia. This gave Hitler the confidence to seize the rest of Czechoslovakia just months later.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n12">Appeasement gave Hitler <strong>time to rearm</strong>. Germany&rsquo;s military grew far faster than Britain&rsquo;s. Each concession made the eventual war harder to win. Appeasement also <strong>alienated Stalin</strong> &mdash; being excluded from Munich pushed him toward signing the Nazi-Soviet Pact with Hitler instead.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n13">Context matters, though. Britain was still recovering from World War One. The public feared another war. The military was not ready to fight in 1938. Chamberlain may have been wrong, but his reasoning was not irrational.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n14">Argument 3: Stalin Was Responsible</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">The <dfn class="term" data-def="A non-aggression agreement signed on 23 August 1939 between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It included a secret protocol dividing Poland and Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.">Nazi-Soviet Pact</dfn> (August 1939) sealed Poland&rsquo;s fate. By signing with Hitler, Stalin removed the threat of a two-front war &mdash; the one thing that might have stopped the invasion of Poland.</p>

        <div class="collapsible">

            <span>Stalin&rsquo;s role in enabling the war</span>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n16">The Pact&rsquo;s secret clause agreed to <strong>divide Poland</strong> between Germany and the USSR. Stalin did not just stand aside &mdash; he invaded Poland from the east on 17 September 1939.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n17">Stalin acted out of <strong>self-interest</strong>. He gained territory, time to rearm, and a buffer zone of Baltic states. He calculated that letting the Western nations fight Germany would help the USSR.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n18">However, Stalin&rsquo;s defenders say he was pushed toward the Pact by <strong>Western failures</strong>. He had been excluded from Munich and distrusted the guarantee to Poland. He believed Britain and France wanted to redirect Hitler eastward. Without the Nazi-Soviet Pact, Hitler may never have risked invading Poland &mdash; he would have faced a war on two fronts.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n19">Argument 4: Wider Factors</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">Beyond individual leaders, deeper factors created the conditions that made war possible &mdash; even likely.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n21">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Long-Term Causes</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The Treaty of Versailles (1919)</strong> &mdash; created deep German resentment. The &ldquo;Diktat,&rdquo; War Guilt Clause, reparations, territorial losses, and military limits all fuelled a desire for revenge that Hitler exploited.</li>
            <li><strong>The <dfn class="term" data-def="An international organisation established after World War One to maintain world peace through collective security, disarmament, and negotiation. It ultimately failed because it lacked military power, key members (like the USA) never joined, and it could not prevent aggression by determined dictators.">League of Nations</dfn></strong> &mdash; failed to stop aggression in Manchuria (1931) and Abyssinia (1935). This proved <dfn class="term" data-def="The principle that peace should be maintained by countries acting together through international organisations (like the League of Nations) to prevent aggression. If one nation attacked another, all members would respond collectively. It failed in the 1930s because nations prioritised self-interest over collective action.">collective security</dfn> was an empty promise. Dictators learned they could act without punishment.</li>
            <li><strong>The Great Depression (1929)</strong> &mdash; mass unemployment and poverty created the conditions for extremism. Without the Depression, Hitler would probably never have risen to power. Many countries acted in self-interest rather than working together, and some turned to aggressive dictators who promised easy answers.</li>
          </ul>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n22">The Treaty of Versailles was a <strong>long-term cause</strong>. It did not make war certain, but it created resentment that extremists exploited. Hitler&rsquo;s promise to overturn the Treaty was central to his appeal.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n23">The League of Nations was meant to prevent wars through collective action. It failed &mdash; unable to stop Japan in Manchuria or Italy in Abyssinia. This showed Hitler that no one would stand up to aggression.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n24">The Great Depression (1929) turned German resentment into revolution. Millions lost jobs and hope, making them willing to vote for extreme parties. Without the Depression, the Nazis might have stayed a fringe movement. Aggressive leaders across Europe used their militaries to grab the resources they wanted.</p>

      <!-- Exam Tip -->
      <div class="exam-tip" data-narration-id="n25">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>This is a classic &ldquo;who was to blame?&rdquo; essay topic. The exam question will name <strong>one cause</strong> and ask &ldquo;How far do you agree?&rdquo; &mdash; e.g. appeasement, Hitler&rsquo;s foreign policy, the Nazi-Soviet Pact, or German remilitarisation. Start with that given factor, then add <strong>two more causes</strong> to show balance. Always reach a <strong>clear judgement</strong> in your conclusion &mdash; explain why one cause matters more than the others. Examiners reward answers that <strong>weigh causes against each other</strong>, not just list them.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n26">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>There was no single cause of World War Two. Hitler&rsquo;s ambition drove Europe toward war, but he was helped by a flawed treaty, a weak League, appeasement that rewarded aggression, and a Soviet pact that removed the last barrier to invasion. The war was the result of <strong>collective failure over two decades</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hitler bears the greatest responsibility:</strong> His aims could not be achieved without war. He broke every agreement, manufactured pretexts, and ordered the invasion of Poland.</li>
          <li><strong>He did not act alone:</strong> Appeasement emboldened him, the Nazi-Soviet Pact enabled him, and the failures of Versailles, the League, and the Depression brought him to power. These causes are <strong>connected</strong> &mdash; for example, appeasement alienated Stalin, pushing him toward the Pact with Hitler.</li>
          <li><strong>Think in layers:</strong> Short-term triggers (Poland invasion), medium-term policies (appeasement, the Pact), and long-term factors (Versailles, League failure, Depression) all interacted. Always weigh them against each other and reach a clear judgement.</li>
