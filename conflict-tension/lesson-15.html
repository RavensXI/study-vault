        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Who Was to Blame?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The outbreak of World War Two was not the fault of a single person or a single event. It was the culmination of <strong>twenty years of tension</strong> &mdash; flawed treaties, failed institutions, and a series of disastrous decisions by leaders on all sides. The strongest exam answers recognise that war had <strong>multiple, interconnected causes</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Four Arguments</div>
          <p>Historians and examiners generally organise responsibility for the outbreak of WWII around <strong>four main arguments</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hitler</strong> &mdash; most direct and widely accepted cause</li>
            <li><strong>Chamberlain &amp; Appeasement</strong> &mdash; encouraged and emboldened aggression</li>
            <li><strong>Stalin &amp; the Nazi-Soviet Pact</strong> &mdash; removed the last barrier to invasion</li>
            <li><strong>Wider Factors</strong> &mdash; Treaty of Versailles, League of Nations failure, Great Depression</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Argument 1: Hitler Was Responsible</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">This is the most direct and widely accepted argument. Hitler&rsquo;s aims, as laid out in <dfn class="term" data-def="Meaning 'My Struggle' in German, this was Adolf Hitler's autobiographical manifesto published in 1925. It set out his political ideology, including anti-Semitism, the need for Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe, and the destruction of Communism.">Mein Kampf</dfn>, could <strong>not</strong> be achieved without war. He wanted to overturn the <dfn class="term" data-def="The peace treaty signed in June 1919 that officially ended World War One between Germany and the Allied Powers. It imposed harsh terms on Germany including territorial losses, military restrictions, reparations, and the War Guilt Clause.">Treaty of Versailles</dfn>, unite all German speakers, seize Lebensraum in the east, and destroy Communism.</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>The case against Hitler in detail</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n6">Hitler systematically broke every agreement he made. He rearmed Germany in violation of Versailles, remilitarised the Rhineland, carried out Anschluss with Austria, demanded and then seized the Sudetenland, invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia, and finally invaded Poland.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n7">Each step was calculated &mdash; he tested the resolve of Britain and France and found it wanting. The invasion of Poland was the <strong>direct cause</strong> of the war: it was Hitler who planned it, Hitler who manufactured the Gleiwitz pretext, and Hitler who gave the order to attack.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n8">The key question historians debate is whether Hitler had a <strong>master plan</strong> from the start (the &ldquo;intentionalist&rdquo; view) or whether he was an <strong>opportunist</strong> who exploited situations as they arose (the &ldquo;structuralist&rdquo; view). Either way, his actions were the primary driver of war.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n9">Argument 2: Chamberlain &amp; Appeasement</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">While Hitler was the aggressor, the policy of <dfn class="term" data-def="The policy pursued by Britain and France in the 1930s of making concessions to aggressive powers (especially Nazi Germany) in the hope of avoiding war. It is most closely associated with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.">appeasement</dfn> pursued by Britain and France arguably <strong>encouraged</strong> him. By repeatedly giving in to Hitler&rsquo;s demands, the Western powers sent a message that aggression would be rewarded and that the Allies lacked the will to fight.</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>How appeasement contributed to war</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n11">The Munich Agreement of 1938 is the clearest example. Britain and France allowed Hitler to annex the Sudetenland without a fight, betraying Czechoslovakia and its defensive fortifications. This emboldened Hitler to seize the rest of Czechoslovakia just months later.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n12">Appeasement also gave Hitler <strong>time to rearm</strong>. While Chamberlain claimed he was buying time for Britain to prepare, the reality was that Germany&rsquo;s military grew far faster than Britain&rsquo;s during this period. Each concession made the eventual war harder to win.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n13">However, it is important to consider <strong>context</strong>. Britain was still recovering from World War One. The public feared another devastating conflict. The British military was not ready for war in 1938. Chamberlain may have been wrong, but his reasoning was not irrational.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n14">Argument 3: Stalin Was Responsible</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">The <dfn class="term" data-def="A non-aggression agreement signed on 23 August 1939 between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It included a secret protocol dividing Poland and Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.">Nazi-Soviet Pact</dfn> of August 1939 sealed Poland&rsquo;s fate. By signing a non-aggression agreement with Hitler, Stalin removed the threat of a two-front war &mdash; the one thing that might have deterred the invasion of Poland.</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Stalin&rsquo;s role in enabling the war</span>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n16">The Pact&rsquo;s secret clause agreed to <strong>divide Poland</strong> between Germany and the USSR. Stalin did not merely stand aside &mdash; he actively participated in Poland&rsquo;s destruction, invading from the east on 17 September 1939.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n17">Stalin&rsquo;s motivation was <strong>cynical self-interest</strong>: he gained territory, time to rearm, and a buffer zone of Baltic states. He calculated that letting the Western capitalist nations fight Germany would serve Soviet interests.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n18">However, Stalin&rsquo;s defenders argue he was driven to the Pact by <strong>Western failures</strong>. He had been excluded from Munich, distrusted the Anglo-French guarantee to Poland, and believed Britain and France wanted to redirect Hitler eastward. From Stalin&rsquo;s perspective, the West left him with no alternative.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n19">Argument 4: Wider Factors</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">Beyond the actions of individual leaders, deeper structural factors created the conditions in which war became possible &mdash; even likely.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n21">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Long-Term Causes</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The Treaty of Versailles (1919)</strong> &mdash; created deep German grievance. The &ldquo;Diktat,&rdquo; the War Guilt Clause, reparations, territorial losses, and military humiliation all fuelled a desire for revenge that Hitler exploited ruthlessly.</li>
            <li><strong>The <dfn class="term" data-def="An international organisation established after World War One to maintain world peace through collective security, disarmament, and negotiation. It ultimately failed because it lacked military power, key members (like the USA) never joined, and it could not prevent aggression by determined dictators.">League of Nations</dfn></strong> &mdash; its failure to stop aggression in Manchuria (1931) and Abyssinia (1935) proved that <dfn class="term" data-def="The principle that peace should be maintained by countries acting together through international organisations (like the League of Nations) to prevent aggression. If one nation attacked another, all members would respond collectively. It failed in the 1930s because nations prioritised self-interest over collective action.">collective security</dfn> was an empty promise. Dictators learned they could act with impunity.</li>
            <li><strong>The Great Depression (1929)</strong> &mdash; mass unemployment and economic misery created the conditions for extremism. Without the Depression, it is unlikely Hitler would have risen to power in Germany.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="collapsible">

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n22">The Treaty of Versailles was a <strong>long-term cause</strong>. It did not make war inevitable, but it created a well of resentment that political extremists could draw upon. Hitler&rsquo;s promise to overturn the Treaty was central to his appeal.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n23">The League of Nations was supposed to prevent future wars through collective action. Its repeated failures &mdash; unable to stop Japan in Manchuria, unable to stop Italy in Abyssinia &mdash; demonstrated that no international body would stand up to aggression. This emboldened Hitler.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n24">The Great Depression of 1929 was the catalyst that turned German resentment into political revolution. Mass unemployment, poverty, and despair made millions of Germans willing to vote for extreme parties. Without the Depression, the Nazi Party might have remained a fringe movement.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>This is a classic &ldquo;who was to blame?&rdquo; essay topic. The <strong>best answers</strong> create a balanced, multi-causal argument. Start with Hitler as the main architect of war &mdash; his aims and actions were the most direct cause. Then broaden your analysis to show how appeasement emboldened him, the Nazi-Soviet Pact enabled him, and deeper factors (Versailles, the League, the Depression) created the conditions. Always reach a <strong>clear judgement</strong> &mdash; examiners reward answers that weigh causes against each other rather than simply listing them.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n26">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>There was no single cause of World War Two. Hitler&rsquo;s ambition was the main engine driving Europe toward conflict, but he was enabled by a flawed peace treaty that created grievance, a weak League of Nations that proved collective security was empty, a disastrous policy of appeasement that rewarded aggression, and a cynical Soviet pact that removed the last barrier to invasion. The war was the ultimate consequence of <strong>collective diplomatic failure over two decades</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hitler bears the greatest responsibility:</strong> His aims &mdash; set out in Mein Kampf &mdash; could not be achieved without war. He systematically broke every agreement, manufactured pretexts, and directly ordered the invasion that triggered the conflict.</li>
          <li><strong>But he did not act in a vacuum:</strong> Appeasement emboldened him, the Nazi-Soviet Pact enabled him, and the failures of Versailles, the League, and the global economy created the conditions that brought him to power and allowed him to act unchecked.</li>
          <li><strong>The strongest analysis is multi-causal:</strong> For exam success, demonstrate that war resulted from the interaction of short-term triggers (Poland invasion), medium-term policies (appeasement, the Pact), and long-term structural factors (Versailles, League failure, Depression) &mdash; and always reach a clear, supported judgement.</li>
