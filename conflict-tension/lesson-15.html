        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Who Was to Blame?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">World War Two was not caused by one person or one event. It grew from <strong>twenty years of tension</strong> &mdash; flawed treaties, failed institutions, and bad decisions on all sides. The best exam answers show war had <strong>multiple, connected causes</strong>.</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_war_responsibility.png" alt="Four causes of World War Two arranged as layers from long-term to short-term — bottom layer: wider factors (Treaty of Versailles, League failure, Depression), second layer: appeasement, third layer: the Nazi-Soviet Pact, top layer: Hitler as the direct cause">
        </figure>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Argument 1: Hitler Was Responsible</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">This is the most direct argument. Hitler&rsquo;s aims, set out in <dfn class="term" data-def="Meaning 'My Struggle' in German, this was Adolf Hitler's autobiographical manifesto published in 1925.">Mein Kampf</dfn> (1925), could <strong>not</strong> be achieved without war. He wanted to overturn the <dfn class="term" data-def="The peace treaty signed in June 1919 that officially ended World War One between Germany and the Allied Powers.">Treaty of Versailles</dfn>, unite all German speakers, seize <dfn class="term" data-def="German for 'living space.' Hitler's policy of expanding German territory eastward, particularly into Poland and the Soviet Union, to provide land and resources for the German people.">Lebensraum</dfn> in the east, and destroy Communism. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A record of a secret meeting in November 1937 between Hitler and his top military leaders.">Hossbach Memorandum</dfn> (1937) confirmed these plans. In a secret meeting with his generals, Hitler said Germany could only get the raw materials it needed by <strong>expanding east</strong>. He named Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Lithuania as targets, and said this must happen as soon as possible. War with Britain was to be avoided &mdash; but war itself was inevitable.</p>

            <span>The case against Hitler in detail</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n6">Hitler broke every agreement he made. He rearmed Germany, remilitarised the Rhineland, carried out Anschluss with Austria, seized the Sudetenland, invaded Czechoslovakia, and finally invaded Poland. He also built alliances &mdash; the <strong>Rome&ndash;Berlin Axis</strong> (1936) with Italy, the <strong>Anti-Comintern Pact</strong> (1936) with Japan, and the <strong>Pact of Steel</strong> (1939) with Italy &mdash; making Germany stronger at each step.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n7">Each move was calculated. He tested Britain and France and found them weak. The invasion of Poland was the <strong>direct cause</strong> of war &mdash; Hitler planned it, manufactured the Gleiwitz pretext, and gave the order.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n8">Historians debate whether Hitler had a <strong>master plan</strong> from the start (the &ldquo;intentionalist&rdquo; view) or was an <strong>opportunist</strong> who seized chances as they came (the &ldquo;structuralist&rdquo; view). The Hossbach Memorandum supports the intentionalist view. Either way, his actions were the main driver of war.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n9">Argument 2: Chamberlain &amp; Appeasement</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">Hitler was the aggressor &mdash; but the policy of <dfn class="term" data-def="The policy pursued by Britain and France in the 1930s of making concessions to aggressive powers (especially Nazi Germany) in the hope of avoiding war.">appeasement</dfn> by Britain and France <strong>encouraged</strong> him. By giving in again and again, the Western powers told Hitler that aggression would be rewarded and that they lacked the will to fight.</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>How appeasement contributed to war</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n11">The Munich Agreement (1938) is the clearest example. Britain and France let Hitler take the Sudetenland without a fight, betraying Czechoslovakia. This gave Hitler the confidence to seize the rest of Czechoslovakia just months later.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n12">Appeasement gave Hitler <strong>time to rearm</strong>. Germany&rsquo;s military grew far faster than Britain&rsquo;s. Each concession made the eventual war harder to win. Appeasement also <strong>alienated Stalin</strong> &mdash; being excluded from Munich pushed him toward signing the Nazi-Soviet Pact with Hitler instead.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n13">Context matters, though. Britain was still recovering from World War One. The public feared another war. The military was not ready to fight in 1938. Chamberlain may have been wrong, but his reasoning was not irrational.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n14">Argument 3: Stalin Was Responsible</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">The <dfn class="term" data-def="A non-aggression agreement signed on 23 August 1939 between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.">Nazi-Soviet Pact</dfn> (August 1939) sealed Poland&rsquo;s fate. By signing with Hitler, Stalin removed the threat of a two-front war &mdash; the one thing that might have stopped the invasion of Poland.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n16">The Pact&rsquo;s secret clause agreed to <strong>divide Poland</strong> between Germany and the USSR. Stalin did not just stand aside &mdash; he invaded Poland from the east on 17 September 1939.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n17">Stalin acted out of <strong>self-interest</strong>. He gained territory, time to rearm, and a buffer zone of Baltic states. He calculated that letting the Western nations fight Germany would help the USSR.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n18">However, Stalin&rsquo;s defenders say he was pushed toward the Pact by <strong>Western failures</strong>. He had been excluded from Munich and distrusted the guarantee to Poland. He believed Britain and France wanted to redirect Hitler eastward. Without the Nazi-Soviet Pact, Hitler may never have risked invading Poland &mdash; he would have faced a war on two fronts.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n19">Argument 4: Wider Factors</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">Beyond individual leaders, deeper factors created the conditions that made war possible &mdash; even likely.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n21">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Long-Term Causes</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The Treaty of Versailles (1919)</strong> &mdash; created deep German resentment. The &ldquo;Diktat,&rdquo; War Guilt Clause, reparations, territorial losses, and military limits all fuelled a desire for revenge that Hitler exploited.</li>
            <li><strong>The <dfn class="term" data-def="An international organisation established after World War One to maintain world peace through collective security, disarmament, and negotiation.">League of Nations</dfn></strong> &mdash; failed to stop aggression in Manchuria (1931) and Abyssinia (1935). This proved <dfn class="term" data-def="The principle that peace should be maintained by countries acting together through international organisations (like the League of Nations) to prevent aggression.">collective security</dfn> was an empty promise. Dictators learned they could act without punishment.</li>
            <li><strong>The Great Depression (1929)</strong> &mdash; mass unemployment and poverty created the conditions for extremism. Without the Depression, Hitler would probably never have risen to power. Many countries acted in self-interest rather than working together, and some turned to aggressive dictators who promised easy answers.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n22">The Treaty of Versailles was a <strong>long-term cause</strong>. It did not make war certain, but it created resentment that extremists exploited. Hitler&rsquo;s promise to overturn the Treaty was central to his appeal.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n23">The League of Nations was meant to prevent wars through collective action. It failed &mdash; unable to stop Japan in Manchuria or Italy in Abyssinia. This showed Hitler that no one would stand up to aggression.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n24">The Great Depression (1929) turned German resentment into revolution. Millions lost jobs and hope, making them willing to vote for extreme parties. Without the Depression, the Nazis might have stayed a fringe movement. Aggressive leaders across Europe used their militaries to grab the resources they wanted.</p>

        <p>This is a classic &ldquo;who was to blame?&rdquo; essay topic. The exam question will name <strong>one cause</strong> and ask &ldquo;How far do you agree?&rdquo; &mdash; e.g. appeasement, Hitler&rsquo;s foreign policy, the Nazi-Soviet Pact, or German remilitarisation. Start with that given factor, then add <strong>two more causes</strong> to show balance. Always reach a <strong>clear judgement</strong> in your conclusion &mdash; explain why one cause matters more than the others.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>There was no single cause of World War Two. Hitler&rsquo;s ambition drove Europe toward war, but he was helped by a flawed treaty, a weak League, appeasement that rewarded aggression, and a Soviet pact that removed the last barrier to invasion. The war was the result of <strong>collective failure over two decades</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hitler bears the greatest responsibility:</strong> His aims could not be achieved without war. He broke every agreement, manufactured pretexts, and ordered the invasion of Poland.</li>
          <li><strong>He did not act alone:</strong> Appeasement emboldened him, the Nazi-Soviet Pact enabled him, and the failures of Versailles, the League, and the Depression brought him to power. These causes are <strong>connected</strong> &mdash; for example, appeasement alienated Stalin, pushing him toward the Pact with Hitler.</li>
          <li><strong>Think in layers:</strong> Short-term triggers (Poland invasion), medium-term policies (appeasement, the Pact), and long-term factors (Versailles, League failure, Depression) all interacted. Always weigh them against each other and reach a clear judgement.</li>

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY Hitler\u2019s aims made war inevitable.\nExample: Hitler\u2019s aims, set out in Mein Kampf (1925), could not be achieved without war. He wanted to overturn the Treaty of Versailles, unite all German speakers, seize Lebensraum in the east, and destroy Communism. The Hossbach Memorandum (1937) confirmed these plans \u2014 in a secret meeting, Hitler told his generals Germany must expand east, naming Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland as targets. Each step \u2014 remilitarising the Rhineland (1936), Anschluss with Austria (1938), seizing the Sudetenland (1938), invading Czechoslovakia (March 1939), and finally invading Poland (September 1939) \u2014 was calculated. He built alliances through the Rome\u2013Berlin Axis (1936) and the Pact of Steel (1939) to strengthen Germany\u2019s position.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: Hitler wanted Lebensraum and to overturn Versailles. He rearmed Germany, remilitarised the Rhineland, and carried out Anschluss with Austria. Each time Britain and France did not stop him, so he grew bolder. The invasion of Poland in September 1939 was the final step that triggered war.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Hitler broke the Treaty of Versailles by rearming Germany and taking back territory. He invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, which caused Britain and France to declare war.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: Hitler wanted more land and this led to war. / Hitler invaded Poland and this started the war.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the League\u2019s failures connected to the wider causes of war.\nExample: The League of Nations was meant to prevent wars through collective security, but its failures in the 1930s demonstrated that aggression would go unpunished. Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931 and the League could do nothing effective. Italy invaded Abyssinia in 1935 and the League\u2019s sanctions were half-hearted \u2014 oil was not included. These failures showed Hitler that the international community lacked the will to act. He used this knowledge to remilitarise the Rhineland, carry out Anschluss, and seize the Sudetenland, each time calculating correctly that neither the League nor individual nations would stop him. The League\u2019s weakness was a structural problem \u2014 the USA never joined, and it had no army to enforce its decisions.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: The League failed to stop Japan in Manchuria (1931) and Italy in Abyssinia (1935). This proved collective security was an empty promise. Dictators like Hitler learned they could act aggressively without punishment, which encouraged him to pursue his aims by force.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: The League of Nations could not stop countries from attacking others. Japan took Manchuria and Italy invaded Abyssinia. This showed Hitler that no one would stop him if he was aggressive.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: The League of Nations was too weak to stop wars. / The League failed and this helped lead to World War Two.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the Treaty\u2019s terms created long-term conditions for conflict.\nExample: The Treaty of Versailles created deep German resentment that Hitler exploited. Germans called it the \u2018Diktat\u2019 because they were excluded from negotiations and forced to sign. The War Guilt Clause (231) was seen as a lie, and it morally justified every other punishment \u2014 reparations, territorial losses, and military restrictions. This resentment fuelled extremism. Hitler\u2019s promise to overturn Versailles was central to his appeal. The Great Depression of 1929 turned this resentment into revolution, pushing millions of unemployed Germans toward the Nazi Party. Without Versailles, there would have been no resentment for Hitler to exploit; without the Depression, the Nazis might have stayed a fringe movement.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: The Treaty of Versailles created resentment in Germany through the War Guilt Clause, reparations, territorial losses, and military restrictions. Germans called it a \u2018Diktat\u2019 because they had no say. Hitler promised to overturn Versailles and this was a major reason people voted for him.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: The Treaty of Versailles punished Germany with reparations, land losses, and military limits. Germans were angry about this and supported Hitler because he promised to reverse it.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: The Treaty of Versailles was harsh on Germany. / Germans hated the treaty and this helped Hitler come to power.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: Hitler bears the greatest responsibility because his aims \u2014 overturning Versailles, Lebensraum, destroying Communism \u2014 could not be achieved without war. The Hossbach Memorandum (1937) confirmed he planned eastward expansion. He broke every agreement, manufactured the Gleiwitz pretext, and ordered the invasion of Poland. However, he did not act alone. Appeasement by Britain and France emboldened him \u2014 the Munich Agreement handed him the Sudetenland and taught him the Western powers would not fight. Appeasement also alienated Stalin, pushing him toward the Nazi-Soviet Pact, which removed the last barrier to invasion. The causes are connected: Versailles created resentment, the Depression brought Hitler to power, the League\u2019s failure showed aggression went unpunished, and appeasement let him grow stronger.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Hitler was the most responsible because his aims made war inevitable. He wanted Lebensraum and to overturn Versailles. He rearmed Germany, remilitarised the Rhineland, carried out Anschluss, seized the Sudetenland, invaded Czechoslovakia, and invaded Poland. He built alliances through the Rome\u2013Berlin Axis and Pact of Steel. The invasion of Poland was premeditated \u2014 he staged the Gleiwitz Incident as a false pretext.\nExample (other factor): Appeasement by Chamberlain was also responsible. Britain and France gave in repeatedly \u2014 over the Rhineland, Austria, and the Sudetenland. The Munich Agreement rewarded Hitler\u2019s aggression and gave him confidence that the Western powers would not fight. It also alienated Stalin, making the Nazi-Soviet Pact more likely.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Stalin also had some responsibility. The Nazi-Soviet Pact of August 1939 removed the threat of a two-front war. The secret clause agreed to divide Poland. Without the Pact, Hitler might not have risked invasion because he would have faced the Soviet Union as well as Britain and France.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: Appeasement was a significant cause because it emboldened Hitler and allowed Germany to grow far stronger than it might have been. The Munich Agreement (1938) handed Hitler the Sudetenland without a fight, which gave him the confidence to seize the rest of Czechoslovakia. Crucially, appeasement also alienated Stalin \u2014 being excluded from Munich convinced him that Britain and France wanted to redirect Hitler eastward, pushing him toward the Nazi-Soviet Pact. However, the main cause was Hitler himself. His aims in Mein Kampf and the Hossbach Memorandum could not have been achieved without war. Appeasement did not create Hitler\u2019s ambitions \u2014 it merely failed to stop them. Wider factors also mattered: the Treaty of Versailles created the resentment Hitler exploited, and the Great Depression brought him to power.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Appeasement contributed to war because it let Hitler grow stronger. Each concession \u2014 the Rhineland, Austria, the Sudetenland \u2014 went unchallenged. The Munich Agreement rewarded aggression. Appeasement gave Hitler time to rearm and build alliances like the Rome\u2013Berlin Axis and the Pact of Steel. By 1939, Germany was far stronger militarily than it had been in 1936.\nExample (other factor): The Treaty of Versailles was a deeper cause because it created the resentment that made Hitler\u2019s rise possible. The \u2018Diktat,\u2019 War Guilt Clause, reparations, and territorial losses fuelled a desire for revenge. Hitler\u2019s promise to overturn Versailles was central to his appeal. The Great Depression then pushed millions of desperate Germans toward the Nazi Party.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The Nazi-Soviet Pact was also important. Signed on 23 August 1939, it removed the threat of a two-front war. The secret clause divided Poland between Germany and the USSR. Without the Pact, Hitler might not have invaded Poland.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Appeasement let Hitler get away with things. / The Treaty of Versailles made Germany angry and helped Hitler come to power.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.

The \u2018Diktat\u2019 and the War Guilt Clause created deep resentment in Germany, and the territorial losses, reparations, and military restrictions gave extremists like Hitler powerful grievances to exploit. However, twenty years passed between the Treaty and the war. It took the Great Depression (1929) to turn resentment into revolution \u2014 mass unemployment pushed millions toward the Nazi Party. And it took Hitler\u2019s specific aims \u2014 Lebensraum, overturning Versailles, destroying Communism \u2014 to translate that resentment into military aggression. The Treaty was the soil, the Depression was the rain, but Hitler was the one who chose to wage war.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The Treaty of Versailles created the resentment that Hitler exploited. Germans called it a \u2018Diktat\u2019 because they were excluded from negotiations. The War Guilt Clause was seen as a lie. Reparations crippled the economy. Territorial losses like the Polish Corridor and Alsace-Lorraine were humiliating. Hitler\u2019s promise to overturn Versailles was central to his appeal.\nExample (other factor): Hitler\u2019s aims were the most direct cause. Mein Kampf (1925) set out his plans for Lebensraum and the destruction of Communism. The Hossbach Memorandum (1937) confirmed he planned to expand east by attacking Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. He broke every agreement and manufactured the Gleiwitz pretext to invade Poland. His aims could not have been achieved without war.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The failure of the League of Nations also helped cause the war. It could not stop Japan in Manchuria (1931) or Italy in Abyssinia (1935). This proved collective security was empty and showed Hitler that aggression would not be punished.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The Treaty of Versailles was harsh and made Germany angry. / Hitler came to power because of the Depression and wanted to reverse Versailles.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."
