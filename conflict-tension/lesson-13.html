        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The End of Appeasement</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Chamberlain&rsquo;s promise of &ldquo;peace for our time&rdquo; lasted less than six months. In March 1939, Hitler invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia, tearing up the <dfn class="term" data-def="The agreement signed in September 1938 between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy that allowed Hitler to annex the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in exchange for a promise of no further territorial expansion.">Munich Agreement</dfn>. <dfn class="term" data-def="The policy pursued by Britain and France in the 1930s of making concessions to aggressive powers (especially Nazi Germany) in the hope of avoiding war. It is most closely associated with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.">Appeasement</dfn> was dead.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The Sudetenland had a German-speaking majority, so Hitler could claim self-determination. The rest of Czechoslovakia was <strong>not</strong> German. This invasion proved Hitler wanted <strong>empire</strong>, not just unity for German speakers.</p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Britain and France responded with a <strong>guarantee to Poland</strong> &mdash; if Hitler attacked, they would declare war. The era of giving in was over. The question was no longer <em>whether</em> war would come, but <em>when</em>.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n5">Stalin&rsquo;s Dilemma</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">Soviet leader <strong>Joseph Stalin</strong> was suspicious of both sides. He had alliance offers from the Western democracies and from Nazi Germany, but strong reasons to distrust each.</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_stalin_dilemma.png" alt="Stalin's dilemma in 1939 — two options compared side by side: ally with Britain and France (pros: collective defence; cons: excluded from Munich, weak Drax mission, unreliable guarantee) versus sign pact with Germany (pros: time to rebuild army, gain territory; cons: Germany's stated goal was to destroy communism, deal was temporary)">
        </figure>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n12">The Nazi-Soviet Pact</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">On <strong>23 August 1939</strong>, the world was stunned. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union &mdash; sworn ideological enemies &mdash; signed a <dfn class="term" data-def="A non-aggression agreement signed on 23 August 1939 between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It included a secret protocol dividing Poland and Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.">Nazi-Soviet Pact</dfn>. Also called the <dfn class="term" data-def="The alternative name for the Nazi-Soviet Pact of August 1939, named after the Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop who signed the agreement.">Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact</dfn>, it was a non-aggression deal with devastating secret clauses. Nazi Foreign Minister <strong>Joachim von Ribbentrop</strong> flew to Moscow to meet Stalin and Soviet Foreign Minister <strong>Molotov</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n14">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Secret Protocol</div>
          <p>The Pact included a <strong>secret clause</strong> agreeing to <strong>divide Poland</strong> between Germany and the USSR. It also gave Stalin a <strong>sphere of influence</strong> over the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) and parts of Finland &mdash; a buffer zone against future German attack.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n15">Why Hitler Signed</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n16">The Pact was a tactical masterstroke for Hitler. It gave him a <strong>green light to invade Poland</strong> without Soviet attack from the east. Germany could avoid a <dfn class="term" data-def="A military situation in which a country must fight enemies on two separate geographical fronts simultaneously. Germany's two-front war in World War One (fighting France in the west and Russia in the east) was seen as a key reason for its defeat, and Hitler was determined to avoid repeating this.">two-front war</dfn> &mdash; the nightmare that had destroyed Germany in World War One. It also stopped Britain and France from forming an alliance with the USSR that could surround Germany. On top of this, the USSR promised <strong>one million tons of food, oil and raw materials</strong> plus electric equipment and trains &mdash; vital resources for the coming war.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n17">Why Stalin Signed</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">Stalin&rsquo;s decision was logical, if cynical. The Red Army was badly weakened &mdash; his <dfn class="term" data-def="Stalin's campaign of political repression in the 1930s, in which hundreds of thousands were executed or imprisoned. The military purges removed most of the Red Army's senior officers, leaving it poorly led and unprepared for war.">purges</dfn> had executed <strong>81 out of 103 generals</strong>, leaving the military poorly led. The Pact gave him <strong>time to rearm</strong>. He used this time to move factories deeper into Russia, behind the <strong>Ural Mountains</strong>, preparing for when Hitler eventually betrayed him. He also gained <strong>territory</strong> &mdash; eastern Poland and influence over the Baltic states, creating a buffer zone. In return, Stalin sent Germany <strong>30 warplanes</strong> and samples of other weapons.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n19">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Stalin&rsquo;s Calculation</div>
          <p>Stalin had been alienated at Munich. He did not trust the guarantee to Poland. Signing with Hitler was not an endorsement of Nazism &mdash; it was a <strong>survival strategy</strong>: gain time, gain territory, and let the capitalist nations fight each other first.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When analysing why Stalin signed the Pact, show it was a <strong>logical if cynical choice</strong>. Explain how he was alienated at Munich, distrusted the guarantee to Poland, and needed time to rebuild the Red Army after the purges. Do not just call it &ldquo;evil&rdquo; &mdash; examiners reward answers that explain the <em>reasoning</em> behind decisions.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n23">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The invasion of Czechoslovakia killed appeasement and led to the guarantee to Poland. The Nazi-Soviet Pact removed Soviet opposition and gave Hitler the confidence to invade, making war almost certain.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Appeasement died in Prague:</strong> Hitler&rsquo;s March 1939 invasion proved his aims went beyond self-determination. Britain and France finally committed to resisting him with the guarantee to Poland.</li>
          <li><strong>The Pact was a cynical bargain:</strong> Hitler avoided a two-front war and gained resources. Stalin gained time to rearm, territory, and a buffer zone. Both knew it was temporary.</li>
          <li><strong>Western failures pushed Stalin toward Hitler:</strong> Exclusion from Munich, the weak Drax mission, and distrust of the Poland guarantee convinced Stalin that signing with Germany was his best option &mdash; sealing Poland&rsquo;s fate.</li>
        </ul>
