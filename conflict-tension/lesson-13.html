        <p data-narration-id="n2">Chamberlain&rsquo;s promise of &ldquo;peace for our time&rdquo; lasted less than six months. In March 1939, Hitler invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia, tearing up the <dfn class="term" data-def="The agreement signed in September 1938 between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy that allowed Hitler to annex the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in exchange for a promise of no further territorial expansion.">Munich Agreement</dfn> and proving beyond doubt that he could not be trusted. <dfn class="term" data-def="The policy pursued by Britain and France in the 1930s of making concessions to aggressive powers (especially Nazi Germany) in the hope of avoiding war.

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Unlike the Sudetenland &mdash; which had a German-speaking majority and could be justified under self-determination &mdash; the rest of Czechoslovakia was <strong>not</strong> German. Hitler&rsquo;s invasion in March 1939 proved his aims went far beyond &ldquo;uniting German-speaking peoples.&rdquo; He wanted <strong>empire</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Britain and France responded by issuing a <strong>guarantee to Poland</strong> &mdash; if Hitler attacked Poland, they would declare war. The era of giving in to Hitler&rsquo;s demands was over. The question was no longer <em>whether</em> war would come, but <em>when</em>.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n5">Stalin&rsquo;s Dilemma</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">The Soviet leader <strong>Joseph Stalin</strong> was suspicious of both sides and faced an impossible choice. He received alliance offers from both the Western democracies and Nazi Germany, and had strong reasons to distrust each.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n8">Stalin believed Britain and France <strong>wanted Nazism and Communism to destroy each other</strong>, leaving the Western democracies safe.

        <h2 data-narration-id="n12">The Nazi-Soviet Pact</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">On <strong>23 August 1939</strong>, the world was stunned when Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union &mdash; sworn ideological enemies &mdash; signed a <dfn class="term" data-def="A non-aggression agreement signed on 23 August 1939 between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n14">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Secret Protocol</div>
          <p>The Pact included a <strong>secret clause</strong> agreeing to <strong>divide Poland</strong> between Germany and the USSR. It also gave Stalin a <strong>sphere of influence</strong> over the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) and parts of Finland &mdash; providing a crucial buffer zone against future German attack.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n15">Why Hitler Signed</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n16">For Hitler, the Pact was a tactical masterstroke. It gave him a <strong>green light to invade Poland</strong> without fear of Soviet attack from the east. Crucially, it meant Germany could avoid a <dfn class="term" data-def="A military situation in which a country must fight enemies on two separate geographical fronts simultaneously. Germany's two-front war in World War One (fighting France in the west and Russia in the east) was seen as a key reason for its defeat, and Hitler was determined to avoid repeating this.">two-front war</dfn> &mdash; the nightmare that had helped destroy Germany in World War One.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n17">Why Stalin Signed</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">Stalin&rsquo;s decision was logical, if cynical. The Red Army was critically weakened after his <dfn class="term" data-def="Stalin's campaign of political repression in the 1930s, in which hundreds of thousands were executed or imprisoned. The military purges removed most of the Red Army's senior officers, leaving it poorly led and unprepared for war.">purges</dfn> of the 1930s had removed most of its experienced officers. The Pact gave him <strong>time to rearm</strong>. He also gained <strong>territory</strong> &mdash; the secret deal gave the USSR the eastern half of Poland and influence over the Baltic states, creating a buffer zone between the Soviet heartland and Nazi Germany.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n19">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Stalin&rsquo;s Calculation</div>
          <p>Stalin had been alienated by the Western powers at Munich. He did not trust their guarantee to Poland. Signing with Hitler was not an endorsement of Nazism &mdash; it was a <strong>survival strategy</strong>: gain time, gain territory, and let the capitalist nations fight each other first.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When analysing why Stalin signed the Nazi-Soviet Pact, demonstrate that it was a <strong>logical if cynical choice</strong>. The strongest answers will explain how Stalin had been alienated by the Western powers at Munich, distrusted their guarantees to Poland, and needed time to rebuild the Red Army after the purges. Avoid simply calling it &ldquo;evil&rdquo; &mdash; examiners reward answers that explain the <em>reasoning</em> behind historical decisions.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n23">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The invasion of Czechoslovakia killed appeasement and led directly to the guarantee to Poland. The Nazi-Soviet Pact removed the threat of Soviet opposition and gave Hitler the confidence to invade Poland, making the outbreak of World War Two a virtual certainty.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Appeasement died in Prague:</strong> Hitler&rsquo;s invasion of the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 proved his aims went far beyond self-determination &mdash; the Munich Agreement was worthless, and Britain and France finally committed to resisting further aggression with the guarantee to Poland.</li>
          <li><strong>The Pact was a cynical bargain on both sides:</strong> Hitler gained freedom to invade Poland without a two-front war; Stalin gained time to rearm and a buffer zone of territory &mdash; both knew the agreement was temporary, but each calculated it served their immediate interests.</li>
          <li><strong>Western failures pushed Stalin toward Hitler:</strong> Exclusion from Munich, a weak British negotiating effort, and distrust of the Poland guarantee all convinced Stalin that signing with Germany was his best option for survival &mdash; a decision that sealed Poland&rsquo;s fate.</li>
        </ul>
