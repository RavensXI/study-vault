        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The End of Appeasement</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Chamberlain&rsquo;s promise of &ldquo;peace for our time&rdquo; lasted less than six months. In March 1939, Hitler invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia, tearing up the <dfn class="term" data-def="The agreement signed in September 1938 between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy that allowed Hitler to annex the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in exchange for a promise of no further territorial expansion.">Munich Agreement</dfn>. <dfn class="term" data-def="The policy pursued by Britain and France in the 1930s of making concessions to aggressive powers (especially Nazi Germany) in the hope of avoiding war. It is most closely associated with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.">Appeasement</dfn> was dead.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The Sudetenland had a German-speaking majority, so Hitler could claim self-determination. The rest of Czechoslovakia was <strong>not</strong> German. This invasion proved Hitler wanted <strong>empire</strong>, not just unity for German speakers.</p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Britain and France responded with a <strong>guarantee to Poland</strong> &mdash; if Hitler attacked, they would declare war. The era of giving in was over. The question was no longer <em>whether</em> war would come, but <em>when</em>.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n5">Stalin&rsquo;s Dilemma</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">Soviet leader <strong>Joseph Stalin</strong> was suspicious of both sides. He had alliance offers from the Western democracies and from Nazi Germany, but strong reasons to distrust each.</p>

        </figure>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n12">The Nazi-Soviet Pact</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">On <strong>23 August 1939</strong>, the world was stunned. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union &mdash; sworn ideological enemies &mdash; signed a <dfn class="term" data-def="A non-aggression agreement signed on 23 August 1939 between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It included a secret protocol dividing Poland and Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.">Nazi-Soviet Pact</dfn>. Also called the <dfn class="term" data-def="The alternative name for the Nazi-Soviet Pact of August 1939, named after the Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop who signed the agreement.">Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact</dfn>, it was a non-aggression deal with devastating secret clauses. Nazi Foreign Minister <strong>Joachim von Ribbentrop</strong> flew to Moscow to meet Stalin and Soviet Foreign Minister <strong>Molotov</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n14">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Secret Protocol</div>
          <p>The Pact included a <strong>secret clause</strong> agreeing to <strong>divide Poland</strong> between Germany and the USSR. It also gave Stalin a <strong>sphere of influence</strong> over the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) and parts of Finland &mdash; a buffer zone against future German attack.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n15">Why Hitler Signed</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n16">The Pact was a tactical masterstroke for Hitler. It gave him a <strong>green light to invade Poland</strong> without Soviet attack from the east. Germany could avoid a <dfn class="term" data-def="A military situation in which a country must fight enemies on two separate geographical fronts simultaneously. Germany's two-front war in World War One (fighting France in the west and Russia in the east) was seen as a key reason for its defeat, and Hitler was determined to avoid repeating this.">two-front war</dfn> &mdash; the nightmare that had destroyed Germany in World War One. It also stopped Britain and France from forming an alliance with the USSR that could surround Germany. On top of this, the USSR promised <strong>one million tons of food, oil and raw materials</strong> plus electric equipment and trains &mdash; vital resources for the coming war.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n17">Why Stalin Signed</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">Stalin&rsquo;s decision was logical, if cynical. The Red Army was badly weakened &mdash; his <dfn class="term" data-def="Stalin's campaign of political repression in the 1930s, in which hundreds of thousands were executed or imprisoned. The military purges removed most of the Red Army's senior officers, leaving it poorly led and unprepared for war.">purges</dfn> had executed <strong>81 out of 103 generals</strong>, leaving the military poorly led. The Pact gave him <strong>time to rearm</strong>. He used this time to move factories deeper into Russia, behind the <strong>Ural Mountains</strong>, preparing for when Hitler eventually betrayed him. He also gained <strong>territory</strong> &mdash; eastern Poland and influence over the Baltic states, creating a buffer zone. In return, Stalin sent Germany <strong>30 warplanes</strong> and samples of other weapons.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n19">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Stalin&rsquo;s Calculation</div>
          <p>Stalin had been alienated at Munich. He did not trust the guarantee to Poland. Signing with Hitler was not an endorsement of Nazism &mdash; it was a <strong>survival strategy</strong>: gain time, gain territory, and let the capitalist nations fight each other first.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When analysing why Stalin signed the Pact, show it was a <strong>logical if cynical choice</strong>. Explain how he was alienated at Munich, distrusted the guarantee to Poland, and needed time to rebuild the Red Army after the purges. Do not just call it &ldquo;evil&rdquo; &mdash; examiners reward answers that explain the <em>reasoning</em> behind decisions.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n23">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The invasion of Czechoslovakia killed appeasement and led to the guarantee to Poland. The Nazi-Soviet Pact removed Soviet opposition and gave Hitler the confidence to invade, making war almost certain.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Appeasement died in Prague:</strong> Hitler&rsquo;s March 1939 invasion proved his aims went beyond self-determination. Britain and France finally committed to resisting him with the guarantee to Poland.</li>
          <li><strong>The Pact was a cynical bargain:</strong> Hitler avoided a two-front war and gained resources. Stalin gained time to rearm, territory, and a buffer zone. Both knew it was temporary.</li>
          <li><strong>Western failures pushed Stalin toward Hitler:</strong> Exclusion from Munich, the weak Drax mission, and distrust of the Poland guarantee convinced Stalin that signing with Germany was his best option &mdash; sealing Poland&rsquo;s fate.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the Pact made war inevitable.\nExample: The Nazi-Soviet Pact contributed to the outbreak of war partly because Hitler had misjudged the strength of Britain and France\u2019s commitment to Poland. Hitler presumed that Britain could be appeased as they had been in Munich when the Nazi takeover of the Sudetenland had gone unchallenged. The Pact removed the threat of a two-front war, which had destroyed Germany in World War One, and gave Hitler confidence to invade Poland on 1 September 1939. The secret clause dividing Poland between Germany and the USSR meant both powers had a stake in its destruction.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: The Nazi-Soviet Pact contributed to the outbreak of war because it guaranteed that Hitler could invade Poland and would not have a war on two fronts. However, Hitler could have expected a war to break out because Britain and France had promised to protect Poland after the invasion of Czechoslovakia in March 1939.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: The Nazi-Soviet Pact was signed on 23 August 1939. It meant Germany and the USSR would not attack each other. This allowed Hitler to invade Poland on 1 September without worrying about the Soviet Union.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: The Nazi-Soviet Pact meant Hitler could attack Poland. / Germany and Russia agreed not to fight each other.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY appeasement collapsed.\nExample: Appeasement ended because Hitler\u2019s invasion of the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 proved his aims went beyond self-determination. The Sudetenland had a German-speaking majority, but the rest of Czechoslovakia was not German \u2014 this proved Hitler wanted empire, not just unity for German speakers. Britain and France responded with a guarantee to Poland, committing to war if Hitler attacked. This marked the end of the policy of giving in, but it also pushed Stalin toward Germany because he distrusted the guarantee and had been excluded from Munich.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: Appeasement ended after Hitler invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, tearing up the Munich Agreement. This proved his promises were worthless. Britain and France then gave a guarantee to Poland, pledging to defend it if Hitler attacked. The era of concessions was over.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Hitler broke the Munich Agreement by invading Czechoslovakia. Britain and France decided they would not give in again and promised to protect Poland if Germany attacked.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY multiple factors influenced Stalin\u2019s decision.\nExample: Stalin\u2019s decision was shaped by a combination of military weakness, Western failures, and territorial ambition. The Red Army was badly weakened after the purges had executed 81 out of 103 generals, leaving it poorly led. Stalin needed time to rearm and used it to move factories behind the Ural Mountains. He had been alienated at Munich and distrusted Britain\u2019s commitment \u2014 the Drax mission arrived by slow boat with no authority to sign an agreement. The Pact gave him territory in eastern Poland and influence over the Baltic states, creating a buffer zone against future German attack.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: Stalin signed the Pact because his Red Army was too weak to fight Germany. His purges had removed most senior officers. The Pact gave him time to rebuild his military and also gained him territory in eastern Poland and the Baltic states as a buffer zone.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Stalin did not trust Britain and France. They had excluded him from Munich. He signed with Hitler to gain time and territory. The secret clause gave him eastern Poland.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: Although the Nazi-Soviet Pact was the trigger for war against Poland, the principal underlying cause was the aims of Hitler, such as Lebensraum, which could not have been achieved without military conquest and which had already alienated Britain sufficiently to guarantee Polish independence. The Pact removed the threat of a two-front war and gave Germany resources including one million tons of food, oil and raw materials, but Hitler\u2019s plans for eastward expansion predated the Pact by years.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The Nazi-Soviet Pact provided the opportunity to go to war, as Hitler knew he could attack Poland in safety as Stalin would remain \u2018neutral.\u2019 He could concentrate on Britain and France in the west as they had guaranteed to defend Poland. The secret clause dividing Poland meant the Soviet Union would invade from the east on 17 September 1939.\nExample (other factor): Hitler\u2019s aims to build a thousand-year Reich and create Lebensraum made conflict inevitable. The Hossbach Memorandum of 1937 showed he planned eastward expansion. The appeasement policies of Britain and France allowed Hitler to gain strength \u2014 the Munich Agreement handed him the Sudetenland and alienated Stalin, pushing him toward the Pact.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The Nazi-Soviet Pact was important because it meant Hitler did not have to fight on two fronts. Germany and the USSR agreed to divide Poland between them. Without the Pact, Hitler might not have risked the invasion.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: Appeasement contributed to the outbreak of war because it emboldened Hitler \u2014 the Munich Agreement handed him the Sudetenland and showed that Britain and France would not fight. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 had already legitimised German rearmament. Each concession convinced Hitler the democracies were weak. However, appeasement alone did not cause the war. Hitler\u2019s aggressive foreign policy \u2014 his aims for Lebensraum, destroying Versailles, and uniting all Germans \u2014 meant conflict was likely regardless. The Nazi-Soviet Pact of August 1939 was the enabling factor that removed the two-front war threat and gave Hitler confidence to invade Poland. Appeasement ended in March 1939 when Hitler broke the Munich Agreement, and the guarantee to Poland was a reversal of that policy \u2014 yet war still came.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Appeasement encouraged Hitler by showing him that Britain and France would not resist. The Munich Agreement gave him the Sudetenland without a fight. Chamberlain returned promising \u2018peace for our time,\u2019 but this only convinced Hitler the democracies were weak. Britain was not militarily ready \u2014 Chamberlain feared another World War One \u2014 but the policy gave Hitler time to grow stronger.\nExample (other factor): The Nazi-Soviet Pact was also a crucial cause. Signed on 23 August 1939, it included a secret clause to divide Poland between Germany and the USSR. It freed Hitler from a two-front war \u2014 the nightmare that had destroyed Germany in 1918. Stalin gained time to rearm after purging 81 of 103 generals, territory in eastern Poland, and a buffer zone of Baltic states. Without the Pact, Hitler might not have risked invading Poland.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Appeasement was important because it let Hitler take the Rhineland, Austria, and the Sudetenland without opposition. Each success made him bolder. But Hitler\u2019s own aims for Lebensraum and destroying the Treaty of Versailles also made war likely because these could only be achieved through aggression.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Appeasement meant Hitler was allowed to take land without being stopped. / Hitler wanted to expand Germany and this caused war.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms.

Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: Hitler\u2019s aggressive foreign policy was the principal cause of war because his aims \u2014 Lebensraum, destroying the Treaty of Versailles, uniting all Germans, and Aryan supremacy \u2014 could only be achieved through military conquest. He left the League of Nations in 1933, began rearmament in 1935, remilitarised the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, took the Sudetenland at Munich, then invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. Each step proved his promises were worthless. However, the Nazi-Soviet Pact of August 1939 was the enabling factor. It removed the threat of a two-front war and gave Hitler confidence to invade Poland. Stalin\u2019s decision was shaped by Western failures \u2014 exclusion from Munich, the weak Drax mission sent by slow boat with no authority to sign, and distrust of the guarantee to Poland. Appeasement also played a role by allowing Hitler to grow stronger unchallenged.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Hitler\u2019s aims made war almost certain. In Mein Kampf he outlined plans for Lebensraum and destroying Versailles. He rearmed Germany, remilitarised the Rhineland, annexed Austria, and took the Sudetenland. When he invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 \u2014 breaking the Munich Agreement \u2014 it proved his aims went beyond self-determination. The invasion of Poland on 1 September was the logical conclusion of this pattern of aggression.\nExample (other factor): The Nazi-Soviet Pact signed on 23 August 1939 also made war possible. Its secret clause agreed to divide Poland between Germany and the USSR. It freed Hitler from a two-front war. Stalin gained time to rearm \u2014 his purges had executed 81 of 103 generals \u2014 plus territory and one million tons of food, oil and raw materials were traded. Without the Pact, Hitler might not have risked the invasion.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Hitler\u2019s foreign policy caused the war because he kept breaking treaties and taking territory. He remilitarised the Rhineland, took Austria, then Czechoslovakia. When he invaded Poland, Britain and France declared war. The Treaty of Versailles also played a role because it created the resentment Hitler exploited to gain public support.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Hitler caused the war because he kept invading countries. / The Treaty of Versailles made Germany angry and this helped Hitler.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.
