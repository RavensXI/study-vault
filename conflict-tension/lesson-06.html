        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Mixed Fortunes for the League</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The 1920s were a mixed decade for the League. It settled some disputes and did great humanitarian work. But it also exposed serious weaknesses &mdash; especially when powerful nations were involved.</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_league_scorecard.png" alt="League of Nations scorecard — successes with small nations (Aaland Islands, Upper Silesia, Bulgaria) versus failures with powerful nations (Vilna, Corfu). Pattern: the League only worked against small nations.">

        <!-- SUCCESSES -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">The League&rsquo;s Successes</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">The League resolved several territorial disputes in the early 1920s. This showed <dfn class="term" data-def="The principle that peace is maintained by countries acting together to prevent aggression. If one nation attacked another, all League members would respond collectively through moral condemnation, economic sanctions, or military action.">collective security</dfn> could work &mdash; at least when the nations involved were small enough to accept the League&rsquo;s rulings.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n13">Humanitarian Work</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">Beyond settling disputes, the League did hugely valuable humanitarian work through its specialist commissions. This is often overlooked but represents some of the League&rsquo;s greatest achievements.</p>

            <li><strong>Health Organisation:</strong> Led global campaigns against <strong>malaria</strong> and <strong>leprosy</strong>, saving countless lives.</li>
            <li><strong>International Labour Organisation (ILO):</strong> Improved working conditions worldwide, including banning <strong>lead paint</strong> and limiting <strong>child labour</strong>. In 1930 it helped Greece set up social insurance for the unemployed. However, its 1919 attempt to ban children under 14 from working was <strong>ignored by most members</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Slavery Commission:</strong> Freed about <strong>200,000 slaves</strong> in Sierra Leone and fought forced labour across Africa and the Middle East.</li>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">The League&rsquo;s failures in the 1920s were fewer than its successes, but far more serious. Each involved a powerful nation defying the League &mdash; exposing the fatal weakness at the heart of collective security.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n26">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1920s showed the League could do good work with humanitarian projects and smaller disputes. But Vilna and Corfu exposed cracks that would widen badly in the 1930s.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Success with small nations, failure with powerful ones:</strong> The League settled disputes between weaker countries (Aaland Islands, Upper Silesia, Bulgaria). But when major powers like Italy or France were involved, no one enforced the rules against them.</li>
          <li><strong>Valuable humanitarian work:</strong> Commissions returned 400,000 POWs, fought diseases, freed 200,000 slaves in Sierra Leone, and improved working conditions &mdash; though some reforms (like the ILO&rsquo;s child labour ban) were ignored by members.</li>
          <li><strong>Corfu set a dangerous precedent:</strong> Mussolini defied the League and the Conference of Ambassadors sided with him. This sent a clear signal: aggressive nations could bully their way to victory. Japan and Italy would exploit this lesson in the 1930s.</li>
        </ul>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the League\u2019s contribution to peace was limited by double standards.\nExample: The contribution to international peace sometimes depended on the status of the country they were defending. In the Corfu invasion by Mussolini, the League originally upheld the complaint by Greece but this was undermined by the influence of more powerful countries such as Britain and France who chose to support Italy\u2019s interests through the Conference of Ambassadors. This set a dangerous precedent: the League only worked against small nations. However, in disputes between smaller countries, the League was genuinely effective \u2014 the Aaland Islands (1921) dispute between Sweden and Finland was resolved peacefully, and Upper Silesia (1921) was divided fairly after a plebiscite.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: The League contributed to peace because it helped avoid a war between Sweden and Finland. Both countries wanted the Aaland Islands in the Baltic Sea. The League ruled in favour of Finland, and Sweden accepted the decision. Similarly, the League organised a plebiscite to settle the Upper Silesia dispute between Germany and Poland, splitting the region based on how each area voted and ensuring both sides kept rail links and water supplies.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: In 1925, Greece invaded Bulgarian territory after Greek soldiers were killed in a border clash. Bulgaria asked the League for help, and the League condemned Greece and ordered a withdrawal. Greece obeyed, avoiding a war.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: The League solved some disputes in the 1920s. / The League helped settle arguments between small countries.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the Corfu Crisis had lasting consequences for the League\u2019s credibility.\nExample: The Corfu Crisis proved that the League could not stand up to powerful nations. In August 1923, an Italian general and four of his team were murdered while surveying the Greek\u2013Albanian border for the League. Mussolini blamed Greece and demanded heavy compensation. When Greece refused, Mussolini bombarded and occupied Corfu. The League condemned Italy, but Mussolini refused to accept the League\u2019s authority. The dispute was handed to the Conference of Ambassadors, which sided with Italy and forced Greece to apologise and pay up. This set a devastating precedent: aggressive nations could bully their way to victory. Just two years later, when Greece invaded Bulgaria in 1925, the League condemned Greece and forced a withdrawal \u2014 exposing clear double standards that only applied to weaker nations.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: The crisis began when an Italian general was murdered while surveying the Greek\u2013Albanian border. Mussolini blamed Greece and bombarded and occupied Corfu when Greece refused to pay compensation. The League condemned Italy, but Mussolini refused to accept the League\u2019s authority. The Conference of Ambassadors \u2014 a group of major powers including Britain, France, Italy, and Japan \u2014 stepped in and sided with Italy, forcing Greece to apologise and pay.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: The Corfu Crisis showed the League was weak because Mussolini ignored it. Italy invaded Corfu and the Conference of Ambassadors overruled the League by siding with Italy. This undermined the League\u2019s authority.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: Italy invaded Corfu and the League could not stop it. / The League was ignored by powerful countries.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the humanitarian work was significant but also had limitations.\nExample: The League\u2019s humanitarian work was arguably its greatest achievement, though it was often overlooked. The Refugee Commission returned about 400,000 prisoners of war to their home countries after World War One. The Health Organisation led global campaigns against malaria and leprosy. The Slavery Commission freed about 200,000 slaves in Sierra Leone and fought forced labour across Africa and the Middle East. However, these successes were limited by member nations\u2019 willingness to cooperate \u2014 the ILO\u2019s 1919 attempt to ban children under 14 from working was ignored by most members, showing even humanitarian work depended on voluntary compliance.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: The International Labour Organisation improved working conditions worldwide, including banning lead paint and limiting child labour. In 1930 it helped Greece set up social insurance for the unemployed. However, its 1919 attempt to ban children under 14 from working was ignored by most members, which showed that even in humanitarian matters the League relied on voluntary cooperation.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: The League\u2019s specialist commissions did valuable work. The Refugee Commission returned 400,000 prisoners of war to their homes. The Slavery Commission freed about 200,000 slaves in Sierra Leone. The Opium Board worked to reduce the drug trade worldwide.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: Self-interest was the decisive factor because it turned the League\u2019s structural weaknesses from potential problems into actual failures. In the 1920s, France refused to act against Poland over Vilna (1920) because it valued Poland as an ally against Germany. At Corfu (1923), Britain and France supported Italy through the Conference of Ambassadors rather than upholding the League\u2019s condemnation. In the 1930s, Britain wanted to maintain good trading relations with Japan and would not risk its fragile economy over Manchuria. Over Abyssinia (1935), Britain and France kept the Suez Canal open, excluded oil from sanctions, and secretly drew up the Hoare-Laval Pact to give Mussolini two-thirds of Abyssinia. However, self-interest was only so damaging because of structural weaknesses \u2014 the absence of the USA meant sanctions were incomplete, and the League had no army to enforce its decisions. Self-interest and structural weakness reinforced each other.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Self-interest was clear throughout the League\u2019s history. France refused to act over Vilna because Poland was an ally. At Corfu, the Conference of Ambassadors sided with Italy. Britain refused to close the Suez Canal during the Abyssinian Crisis because it feared pushing Mussolini towards Hitler. The Hoare-Laval Pact (December 1935) tried to reward aggression by giving Italy two-thirds of Abyssinia. Britain and France prioritised their empires and trade over the League\u2019s principles.\nExample (other factor): The League\u2019s organisation also contributed to its failure. The Assembly met only once a year and decisions required a unanimous vote, making the League painfully slow. It had no permanent army and relied on members providing troops \u2014 which none were willing to do. The Lytton Commission took over a year to report on Manchuria, by which time Japan had conquered the whole region.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The absence of the USA weakened the League because America was the world\u2019s strongest economic power. Without the USA, sanctions were incomplete \u2014 countries could simply trade with America instead. Japan\u2019s main trade was with the USA, so League sanctions over Manchuria were meaningless.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Britain and France put their own interests first instead of supporting the League. / The League had no army to force countries to obey.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: The League\u2019s lack of enforcement power was a fundamental weakness. It had no permanent army and could only rely on moral condemnation or economic sanctions. Over Manchuria, the League voted 42\u20131 against Japan but imposed no sanctions and no military action \u2014 Japan simply walked out and invaded Jehol. Over Abyssinia, sanctions were imposed but deliberately excluded oil, coal, and steel, and the Suez Canal was left open. Members could simply leave the League if they disagreed (Japan 1933, Germany 1933, Italy 1937). However, enforcement was only weak because of self-interest. Britain and France chose not to enforce decisions \u2014 France refused to act over Vilna because Poland was an ally; Britain refused to close the Suez Canal because it feared pushing Mussolini towards Hitler. The tools existed (sanctions, collective military action) but members refused to use them. The absence of the USA also made sanctions incomplete, since countries could trade with America instead.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The League had no army and could only impose moral condemnation or economic sanctions. Over Manchuria, the Lytton Commission took over a year, and even after the League voted 42\u20131 against Japan, no sanctions or military action followed. Japan walked out and invaded Jehol. Over Abyssinia, sanctions excluded oil, coal, and steel. Members could leave the League with no consequences \u2014 Japan (1933), Germany (1933), and Italy (1937) all did so.\nExample (other factor): The self-interest of Britain and France was also crucial. They controlled the League but prioritised their own interests. At Corfu (1923), the Conference of Ambassadors sided with Italy against the League. Over Abyssinia, Britain refused to close the Suez Canal and the Hoare-Laval Pact secretly tried to give Mussolini two-thirds of Abyssinia. The League had some enforcement tools, but its leading members chose not to use them.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The Great Depression also weakened the League. Countries turned to protectionism and refused to impose sanctions that might hurt their own fragile economies. Britain and France slashed military spending, so they could not back up the League with force even if they had wanted to.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The League had no army so countries could ignore it. / Sanctions did not work because they were too weak.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: The absence of the USA was hugely damaging because America was the world\u2019s strongest economic power. Without the USA, economic sanctions were incomplete \u2014 countries could simply trade with America instead of obeying League bans. This was fatal over Manchuria: Japan\u2019s main trade was with the USA, so League sanctions would have been meaningless. The USA also had the military power to challenge aggressors, which the League lacked without it. Its absence reduced the League\u2019s credibility and authority from the start. However, the self-interest of Britain and France was equally important. Even without the USA, Britain and France had the power to act but chose not to. France refused to act over Vilna because Poland was an ally. At Corfu, the Conference of Ambassadors sided with Italy. Over Abyssinia, Britain kept the Suez Canal open and the Hoare-Laval Pact tried to reward Mussolini. The absence of the USA made the League weaker, but it was self-interest that made it useless.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The absence of the USA weakened the League from the start. America was the world\u2019s strongest economic power, so without it, sanctions could never be fully effective. Over Manchuria, Japan\u2019s main trading partner was the USA, making League sanctions pointless. No American military backing meant the League had no credible threat of force. The USA\u2019s absence also reduced the League\u2019s prestige \u2014 other countries saw it as incomplete and weak.\nExample (other factor): The self-interest of Britain and France also caused the League to fail. They controlled the League but prioritised their own empires and trade. At Corfu (1923), the Conference of Ambassadors sided with Mussolini rather than upholding the League\u2019s condemnation of Italy. Over Abyssinia, sanctions deliberately excluded oil, coal, and steel because Britain feared the economic consequences for its own industries.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The League\u2019s organisation was also a weakness. The Assembly met only once a year, decisions required a unanimous vote, and the League had no permanent army. This made it too slow to respond to crises \u2014 the Lytton Commission took over a year to investigate Manchuria.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The USA was the most powerful country and it was not in the League. / The League had no army to stop aggressors.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.
