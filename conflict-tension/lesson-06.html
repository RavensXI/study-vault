        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Mixed Fortunes for the League</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The 1920s were a mixed decade for the League. It settled some disputes and did great humanitarian work. But it also exposed serious weaknesses &mdash; especially when powerful nations were involved.</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_league_scorecard.png" alt="League of Nations scorecard — successes with small nations (Aaland Islands, Upper Silesia, Bulgaria) versus failures with powerful nations (Vilna, Corfu). Pattern: the League only worked against small nations.">

        <!-- SUCCESSES -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">The League&rsquo;s Successes</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">The League resolved several territorial disputes in the early 1920s. This showed <dfn class="term" data-def="The principle that peace is maintained by countries acting together to prevent aggression. If one nation attacked another, all League members would respond collectively through moral condemnation, economic sanctions, or military action.">collective security</dfn> could work &mdash; at least when the nations involved were small enough to accept the League&rsquo;s rulings.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n13">Humanitarian Work</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">Beyond settling disputes, the League did hugely valuable humanitarian work through its specialist commissions. This is often overlooked but represents some of the League&rsquo;s greatest achievements.</p>

            <li><strong>Health Organisation:</strong> Led global campaigns against <strong>malaria</strong> and <strong>leprosy</strong>, saving countless lives.</li>
            <li><strong>International Labour Organisation (ILO):</strong> Improved working conditions worldwide, including banning <strong>lead paint</strong> and limiting <strong>child labour</strong>. In 1930 it helped Greece set up social insurance for the unemployed. However, its 1919 attempt to ban children under 14 from working was <strong>ignored by most members</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Slavery Commission:</strong> Freed about <strong>200,000 slaves</strong> in Sierra Leone and fought forced labour across Africa and the Middle East.</li>
            <li><strong>Opium Board:</strong> Worked to reduce the drug trade worldwide.</li>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n16">The League&rsquo;s Failures</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">The League&rsquo;s failures in the 1920s were fewer than its successes, but far more serious. Each involved a powerful nation defying the League &mdash; exposing the fatal weakness at the heart of collective security.</p>

        <p>Learn <strong>one success</strong> (e.g. Upper Silesia) and <strong>one failure</strong> (e.g. Corfu) in detail.

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n26">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1920s showed the League could do good work with humanitarian projects and smaller disputes. But Vilna and Corfu exposed cracks that would widen badly in the 1930s.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Success with small nations, failure with powerful ones:</strong> The League settled disputes between weaker countries (Aaland Islands, Upper Silesia, Bulgaria). But when major powers like Italy or France were involved, no one enforced the rules against them.</li>
          <li><strong>Valuable humanitarian work:</strong> Commissions returned 400,000 POWs, fought diseases, freed 200,000 slaves in Sierra Leone, and improved working conditions &mdash; though some reforms (like the ILO&rsquo;s child labour ban) were ignored by members.</li>
          <li><strong>Corfu set a dangerous precedent:</strong> Mussolini defied the League and the Conference of Ambassadors sided with him. This sent a clear signal: aggressive nations could bully their way to victory. Japan and Italy would exploit this lesson in the 1930s.</li>
        </ul>
