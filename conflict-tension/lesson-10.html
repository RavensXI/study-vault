        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Hitler Becomes Chancellor</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">In January 1933, Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany. From the start, he pursued an aggressive foreign policy based on ideas from <dfn class="term" data-def="Meaning &lsquo;My Struggle&rsquo; &mdash; Hitler&rsquo;s autobiography and political manifesto, written in 1924 while imprisoned after the failed Beer Hall Putsch. It outlined his views on race, his hatred of the Treaty of Versailles, and his desire for Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe.">Mein Kampf</dfn>. His goal was to overturn the post-war settlement, expand German territory, and make Germany the dominant power in Europe.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">Hitler&rsquo;s Foreign Policy Aims</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Hitler&rsquo;s foreign policy had four linked aims, all from <em>Mein Kampf</em>. Together, they made a clash with the Treaty of Versailles unavoidable.</p>

          <img src="diagram_hitler_aims.png" alt="Hitler's four foreign policy aims from Mein Kampf shown as interlocking puzzle pieces — abolish the Treaty of Versailles, Lebensraum in Eastern Europe, unite all German speakers, defeat Communism — with WAR as the inevitable centre where all four connect">

        <h2 data-narration-id="n6">First Steps: 1933&ndash;1935</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">Between 1933 and 1935, Hitler took careful steps to test the post-war settlement. Each move pushed his aims forward while avoiding a fight Germany was too weak to win.</p>

            <p>At the Disarmament Conference, Hitler demanded that other countries disarm to Germany&rsquo;s level &mdash; or that Germany be allowed to rearm to match France. When France refused, he pulled Germany out of the Conference and the League, blaming Allied hypocrisy.</p>

            <p>Hitler encouraged Austrian Nazis to stage a coup. They murdered Chancellor Dollfuss, but the attempt failed when Mussolini moved Italian troops to the Austrian border as a warning. Hitler backed down &mdash; he was not ready for a confrontation.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">Hitler&rsquo;s rearmament alarmed the Allies, but their response was weak and divided.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Between 1933 and 1935, Hitler began taking apart the Treaty of Versailles. He mixed open defiance with peaceful gestures that divided the Allied response. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement shattered the Stresa Front and convinced Hitler the democracies lacked the will to stop him.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clear aims from the start:</strong> Abolishing the Treaty, <em>Lebensraum</em>, uniting German-speakers, and defeating communism were all in <em>Mein Kampf</em>. His actions after 1933 followed this blueprint.</li>
          <li><strong>Caution enabled aggression:</strong> &ldquo;Peaceful&rdquo; moves like the Polish pact and the Saar vote gave diplomatic cover for the aggressive steps that followed.</li>
          <li><strong>Allied disunity was his greatest asset:</strong> Britain signed the Naval Agreement without consulting France or Italy, destroying the Stresa Front and showing Hitler the democracies could be split apart.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY each step increased tension.\nExample: Hitler\u2019s early foreign policy cleverly mixed aggression with apparent reasonableness, making it difficult for the Allies to respond. Withdrawing from the League in October 1933 was defiant, but signing the Non-Aggression Pact with Poland in January 1934 looked peaceful \u2014 while actually weakening France\u2019s alliance system. When the failed Anschluss of July 1934 showed Mussolini would resist, Hitler backed down, but the Saar plebiscite (over 90% for Germany) and the announcement of rearmament and a 550,000-strong army in March 1935 showed he was systematically dismantling the Treaty of Versailles. Each move tested Allied resolve and found it weak.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: Hitler increased tension by openly rearming Germany. In March 1935, he announced conscription and plans for an army of 550,000 men \u2014 over five times the 100,000 limit set by the Treaty of Versailles. He also revealed the existence of the Luftwaffe. These were direct violations of the Treaty and showed Hitler intended to make Germany a major military power again.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Hitler left the League of Nations in October 1933 and then signed a pact with Poland. In 1935, the Saar voted to rejoin Germany and Hitler announced he was rebuilding Germany\u2019s armed forces.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: Hitler broke the Treaty of Versailles by building up Germany\u2019s army. / Hitler left the League of Nations.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the agreement damaged international relations.\nExample: The Anglo-German Naval Agreement of June 1935 had consequences far beyond its specific terms. By allowing Germany a navy up to 35% of the Royal Navy, including submarines, Britain effectively accepted German rearmament as a fact. More damaging was the diplomatic fallout: Britain signed without consulting France or Italy, shattering the Stresa Front \u2014 the only united opposition to Hitler \u2014 just two months after it was formed. France was furious, Italy felt betrayed, and Hitler learned the most important lesson of his early foreign policy: the democracies could be split apart.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: The Naval Agreement affected international relations because it destroyed the Stresa Front. In April 1935, Britain, France, and Italy had united to condemn German rearmament and uphold the Treaty. But when Britain signed a bilateral deal with Hitler in June without consulting its partners, France was furious and Italy felt betrayed. The united opposition to Hitler collapsed.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Britain signed the Naval Agreement with Germany in June 1935 allowing Germany to build warships and submarines. This upset France and Italy because they had not been consulted. It broke up the Stresa Front.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: Britain agreed to let Germany build a navy. / The agreement upset France and Italy.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the aims connected to specific actions.\nExample: Hitler\u2019s four aims from Mein Kampf \u2014 abolishing the Treaty, uniting German-speakers, gaining Lebensraum in Eastern Europe, and defeating communism \u2014 made a clash with the post-war settlement unavoidable. Each early action served these aims: withdrawing from the League removed the constraint of collective security; the Polish pact weakened France\u2019s alliance system while buying time to rearm; announcing conscription and a 550,000-strong army directly challenged the military clauses. The Saar plebiscite gave Hitler a legitimate reversal of the Treaty, while the failed 1934 Anschluss showed he was already pursuing the union of German-speakers. Together, these actions systematically dismantled the Versailles settlement.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: Hitler\u2019s aim to abolish the Treaty of Versailles directly led to the announcement of rearmament in March 1935. The Treaty had limited Germany\u2019s army to 100,000 men with no air force or submarines. Hitler announced conscription, plans for 550,000 troops, and revealed the Luftwaffe. This was a direct challenge to the military terms and showed he intended to make Germany a great military power again.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Hitler wanted to overturn the Treaty and unite all German-speakers. He left the League of Nations in 1933, tried to unite with Austria in 1934, and announced rearmament in 1935. These all challenged the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: It was Hitler\u2019s wider foreign policy rather than rearmament alone that was the main cause of tension. Although the \u2018Freedom to Rearm Rally\u2019 in 1935 created the problem of how Britain should uphold the Treaty of Versailles, it was not until the invasion of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 that Chamberlain had to accept appeasement had failed. The imminent invasion of Poland was the highest point of tension before war broke out. Rearmament was one step in a broader programme \u2014 leaving the League, the failed Anschluss, and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement were all parts of a pattern that gradually increased tension.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): German rearmament increased tension because it showed Hitler intended to make Germany strong again by using military action if necessary. He held a \u2018Freedom to Rearm Rally\u2019 in 1935. He began to conscript soldiers and announced plans for an army of 550,000 men. He made an agreement with Britain that he could build warships and submarines. He was breaking the Treaty of Versailles and no one stopped him.\nExample (other factor): Britain\u2019s policy of appeasement was also a reason for increased tension. By signing the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in June 1935 without consulting France or Italy, Britain destroyed the Stresa Front and showed Hitler the democracies could be split apart. Each concession encouraged further aggression.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Rearmament increased tension because Hitler broke the Treaty of Versailles by building up his army and air force. The Allies formed the Stresa Front in April 1935 to condemn this, but it collapsed when Britain signed the Naval Agreement.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Hitler rebuilt Germany\u2019s army which broke the Treaty. / The Allies were worried about Germany getting stronger.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: Appeasement emboldened Hitler by showing him the democracies would make concessions rather than confront him \u2014 the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 allowed Germany a navy up to 35% of the Royal Navy and shattered the Stresa Front. Each concession (Rhineland, Anschluss, Munich) encouraged further aggression. However, appeasement alone did not cause the war. Hitler\u2019s aggressive foreign policy \u2014 rooted in Mein Kampf\u2019s aims to abolish the Treaty, gain Lebensraum, and unite German speakers \u2014 drove the expansion. The Treaty of Versailles created the resentment Hitler exploited, and the failure of the League of Nations (over Manchuria and Abyssinia) showed aggressors would not be stopped. Appeasement was one factor in a chain of causes.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Appeasement was the main reason because Britain and France repeatedly gave in to Hitler\u2019s demands. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement (1935) accepted German rearmament. Britain refused to act over the Rhineland (1936). The Munich Agreement (1938) handed the Sudetenland to Hitler. Each concession made Hitler bolder and convinced him the Allies would never fight.\nExample (other factor): Hitler\u2019s aggressive foreign policy was also a key cause. His aims from Mein Kampf \u2014 abolishing the Treaty of Versailles, Lebensraum in Eastern Europe, uniting German speakers \u2014 made conflict inevitable. He left the League in 1933, rearmed in 1935, and announced conscription for a 550,000-strong army. These early moves showed he was determined to overturn the post-war settlement regardless of Allied policy.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Appeasement caused the war because Britain and France did not stop Hitler when he broke the Treaty of Versailles. The Naval Agreement allowed Germany to rearm, and Munich gave Hitler the Sudetenland without a fight.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Appeasement let Hitler get away with breaking the Treaty. / Hitler\u2019s own aims caused the war.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: The Treaty of Versailles created the conditions for war by generating deep German resentment. The War Guilt Clause humiliated Germany, reparations caused economic hardship, and the loss of territory \u2014 especially the Polish Corridor \u2014 gave Hitler ready-made grievances. Hitler exploited anger over the Diktat to justify leaving the League (1933), rearming (1935), and remilitarising the Rhineland (1936). However, the Treaty alone did not make war inevitable. Hitler\u2019s aggressive foreign policy went far beyond reversing Versailles \u2014 his aims from Mein Kampf included Lebensraum in Eastern Europe, which meant conquering territory Germany had never owned. Appeasement emboldened him further, and the failure of the League of Nations showed aggressors would not be stopped. The Treaty created resentment, but it was Hitler\u2019s exploitation of that resentment, combined with Allied weakness, that led to war.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The Treaty of Versailles was the main reason because it created the anger Hitler exploited. Germany was forced to accept the War Guilt Clause, pay reparations, lose territory including the Polish Corridor, and limit its army to 100,000 men. Germans called it a Diktat. Hitler used this resentment to justify rearmament in March 1935 (announcing a 550,000-strong army) and claimed he was simply overturning an unfair treaty.\nExample (other factor): Hitler\u2019s aggressive foreign policy was also crucial. His aims from Mein Kampf went far beyond reversing Versailles \u2014 he wanted Lebensraum in Eastern Europe and Aryan supremacy. Leaving the League in 1933, the Non-Aggression Pact with Poland (1934), and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement (1935) all showed he was building towards expansion, not simply correcting injustice.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The Treaty of Versailles caused the war because it made Germany angry. The War Guilt Clause, reparations, and loss of territory gave Hitler excuses to break the Treaty by rearming and remilitarising the Rhineland.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The Treaty was too harsh on Germany and made them want revenge. / Hitler used anger about the Treaty to gain power.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms.
