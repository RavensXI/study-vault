        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Hitler Becomes Chancellor</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">In January 1933, Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany. From the start, he pursued an aggressive foreign policy based on ideas from <dfn class="term" data-def="Meaning &lsquo;My Struggle&rsquo; &mdash; Hitler&rsquo;s autobiography and political manifesto, written in 1924 while imprisoned after the failed Beer Hall Putsch. It outlined his views on race, his hatred of the Treaty of Versailles, and his desire for Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe.">Mein Kampf</dfn>. His goal was to overturn the post-war settlement, expand German territory, and make Germany the dominant power in Europe.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">Hitler&rsquo;s Foreign Policy Aims</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Hitler&rsquo;s foreign policy had four linked aims, all from <em>Mein Kampf</em>. Together, they made a clash with the Treaty of Versailles unavoidable.</p>

          <img src="diagram_hitler_aims.png" alt="Hitler's four foreign policy aims from Mein Kampf shown as interlocking puzzle pieces — abolish the Treaty of Versailles, Lebensraum in Eastern Europe, unite all German speakers, defeat Communism — with WAR as the inevitable centre where all four connect">

        <h2 data-narration-id="n6">First Steps: 1933&ndash;1935</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">Between 1933 and 1935, Hitler took careful steps to test the post-war settlement. Each move pushed his aims forward while avoiding a fight Germany was too weak to win.</p>

            <p>At the Disarmament Conference, Hitler demanded that other countries disarm to Germany&rsquo;s level &mdash; or that Germany be allowed to rearm to match France. When France refused, he pulled Germany out of the Conference and the League, blaming Allied hypocrisy.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">Hitler&rsquo;s rearmament alarmed the Allies, but their response was weak and divided.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Between 1933 and 1935, Hitler began taking apart the Treaty of Versailles. He mixed open defiance with peaceful gestures that divided the Allied response. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement shattered the Stresa Front and convinced Hitler the democracies lacked the will to stop him.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clear aims from the start:</strong> Abolishing the Treaty, <em>Lebensraum</em>, uniting German-speakers, and defeating communism were all in <em>Mein Kampf</em>. His actions after 1933 followed this blueprint.</li>
          <li><strong>Caution enabled aggression:</strong> &ldquo;Peaceful&rdquo; moves like the Polish pact and the Saar vote gave diplomatic cover for the aggressive steps that followed.</li>
          <li><strong>Allied disunity was his greatest asset:</strong> Britain signed the Naval Agreement without consulting France or Italy, destroying the Stresa Front and showing Hitler the democracies could be split apart.</li>
