        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Hitler Becomes Chancellor</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">In January 1933, Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany. From the very start, he pursued a clear and aggressive foreign policy shaped by the ideas he had set out years earlier in <dfn class="term" data-def="Meaning &lsquo;My Struggle&rsquo; &mdash; Hitler&rsquo;s autobiography and political manifesto, written in 1924 while imprisoned after the failed Beer Hall Putsch. It outlined his views on race, his hatred of the Treaty of Versailles, and his desire for Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe.">Mein Kampf</dfn>. His ultimate goal was to overturn the post-war settlement, expand German territory, and establish Germany as the dominant power in Europe.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">Hitler&rsquo;s Foreign Policy Aims</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Hitler&rsquo;s foreign policy rested on four interconnected ambitions, all rooted in the ideology of <em>Mein Kampf</em>. Together, they pointed towards an inevitable confrontation with the Treaty of Versailles and the European order it had created.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n5">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Hitler&rsquo;s Four Aims</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Abolish the Treaty of Versailles</strong> &mdash; This was his central and most popular aim. The Treaty was hated across Germany, and destroying it would unite the nation behind him.</li>
            <li><strong>Expand German territory &mdash; <dfn class="term" data-def="A German term meaning &lsquo;living space.&rsquo; Hitler believed Germany needed to conquer territory in Eastern Europe &mdash; particularly from Poland and the USSR &mdash; to provide land and resources for the growing German population. This concept was central to Nazi ideology and foreign policy.">Lebensraum</dfn></strong> &mdash; Hitler believed Germany needed &ldquo;living space&rdquo; in Eastern Europe, to be taken from Poland and the USSR.</li>
            <li><strong>Unite all German-speaking people</strong> &mdash; He aimed to create a <em>Greater Germany</em> by absorbing German-speaking populations in Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.</li>
            <li><strong>Defeat Communism</strong> &mdash; Hitler viewed the USSR as Germany&rsquo;s ultimate enemy. Destroying communism and seizing Soviet land were inseparable goals.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n6">First Steps: 1933&ndash;1935</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">Between 1933 and 1935, Hitler took a series of calculated steps to test the boundaries of the post-war settlement. Each move was designed to advance his aims while avoiding a direct military confrontation that Germany was not yet strong enough to win.</p>

            <h4>Withdrawal from the League of Nations</h4>
            <p>At the Disarmament Conference, Hitler proposed that all nations should disarm to Germany&rsquo;s level. When France refused, he used this as justification to pull Germany out of both the Conference and the League itself &mdash; presenting the move as a response to Allied hypocrisy.</p>

            <p>A cunning diplomatic move. On the surface it looked peaceful and reasonable, but Hitler was actually buying time while Germany rearmed. The pact also weakened the alliance between France and Poland, reducing the threat of a two-front war.</p>

            <p>Hitler encouraged Austrian Nazis to stage a coup. They murdered Chancellor Dollfuss, but the attempt failed when Mussolini &mdash; at that time protective of Austrian independence &mdash; moved Italian troops to the Austrian border as a warning.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n9">The Allied Response: Stresa Front to Naval Agreement</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">Hitler&rsquo;s announcement of rearmament alarmed the Allied powers, but their response was fatally inconsistent. In April 1935, Britain, France, and Italy formed the <dfn class="term" data-def="An agreement reached in April 1935 between Britain, France, and Italy at Stresa in northern Italy.

              <p data-narration-id="n13">However, the decision was a diplomatic disaster. France was furious at not being consulted. Italy felt betrayed.

        <p data-narration-id="n15">What made Hitler&rsquo;s early foreign policy so effective was the way he combined defiance with peaceful gestures. Each aggressive step &mdash; leaving the League, rearming, attempting Anschluss &mdash; was balanced by actions that appeared reasonable or conciliatory, such as the Non-Aggression Pact with Poland and the Saar plebiscite.</p>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n19">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Between 1933 and 1935, Hitler began systematically dismantling the Treaty of Versailles. He combined open defiance &mdash; leaving the League, rearming, reintroducing conscription &mdash; with carefully calculated peaceful gestures that confused and divided the Allied response. The weak and inconsistent reaction of Britain and France, culminating in the Anglo-German Naval Agreement that shattered the Stresa Front, convinced Hitler that the democracies lacked the will to stop him.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hitler&rsquo;s aims were clear from the start:</strong> Abolishing the Treaty, expanding into Eastern Europe for <em>Lebensraum</em>, uniting German-speakers, and defeating communism were all laid out in <em>Mein Kampf</em> &mdash; his actions after 1933 followed this blueprint methodically.</li>
          <li><strong>Caution enabled aggression:</strong> Each &ldquo;peaceful&rdquo; move &mdash; the Polish pact, the Saar plebiscite &mdash; created diplomatic cover for the aggressive steps that followed, making it harder for the Allies to justify a strong response.</li>
          <li><strong>Allied disunity was Hitler&rsquo;s greatest asset:</strong> The Anglo-German Naval Agreement proved that Britain would negotiate with Hitler rather than confront him, destroying the Stresa Front and teaching Hitler that the democracies could be divided and exploited.</li>
        </ul>
