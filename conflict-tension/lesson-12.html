        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">What Was Appeasement?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2"><dfn class="term" data-def="The policy of making concessions to an aggressor&rsquo;s demands in order to avoid conflict. In the 1930s, it became the official British foreign policy under Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who believed that satisfying Hitler&rsquo;s &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; demands would prevent another devastating war.">Appeasement</dfn> meant giving in to an aggressor&rsquo;s demands to avoid conflict. From 1937, it became the official policy of British Prime Minister <dfn class="term" data-def="British Prime Minister from May 1937 to May 1940. He is most closely associated with the policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany, particularly the Munich Agreement of September 1938. He declared war on Germany in September 1939 after Hitler invaded Poland.">Neville Chamberlain</dfn>, who believed many of Hitler&rsquo;s grievances were fair and that satisfying them would keep the peace.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">Why Was Appeasement Followed?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Appeasement was not cowardice. It was driven by powerful factors that made it seem the most sensible choice at the time.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n5">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Six Reasons for Appeasement</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fear of another war</strong> &mdash; The trauma of WWI was still vivid. Britain and France had lost 2.3 million soldiers combined. No leader wanted to repeat that.</li>
            <li><strong>The Treaty was seen as unfair</strong> &mdash; Many in Britain felt Germany had been treated too harshly at Versailles. Some of Hitler&rsquo;s demands &mdash; like reuniting German-speakers &mdash; seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li><strong>Fear of Communism</strong> &mdash; Some saw Hitler as a useful barrier against Soviet communism. A strong Germany could act as a buffer against Stalin.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic problems</strong> &mdash; The Great Depression had hit Britain and France hard. Neither felt it could afford war.</li>
            <li><strong>American isolationism</strong> &mdash; The USA had retreated into isolationism. Britain knew it could not count on American support.</li>
            <li><strong>Buying time to rearm</strong> &mdash; Britain&rsquo;s military was not ready for war. Some argue Chamberlain used appeasement to delay conflict while rebuilding the armed forces, especially the RAF.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n6">Case Study 1: <dfn class="term" data-def="The political union of Austria and Germany, achieved by Hitler in March 1938. German troops marched into Austria unopposed on 12 March, and a rigged plebiscite subsequently showed 99.75% support. It was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles but Britain and France took no action to prevent it.">Anschluss</dfn> with Austria (March 1938)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">The Anschluss &mdash; the union of Germany and Austria &mdash; was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. Hitler had tried and failed in 1934, when Mussolini moved Italian troops to the Austrian border to stop him. By 1938, everything had changed: Italy was now Germany&rsquo;s ally through the Rome-Berlin Axis. Mussolini told Hitler that &ldquo;Austria did not interest him at all.&rdquo;</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n9">When Schuschnigg tried to hold a vote on Austrian independence, Hitler threatened invasion. Schuschnigg was forced to resign. On <strong>12 March 1938</strong>, German troops marched in and were met by cheering crowds.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n10">A rigged vote then claimed <strong>99.75% support</strong> for union with Germany. Britain and France only issued diplomatic protests. Churchill protested strongly, but the policy of appeasement prevented stronger action. Most people felt Austria was too far from Britain and too close to Germany for Britain to act.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n10c">Austria gave Germany a springboard for any future invasion of south-eastern Europe.

              <p data-narration-id="n10d">Over 80,000 &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; were rounded up in the first two weeks of occupation, and new laws restricted Jews. Hitler had now taken over another country without firing a shot &mdash; and his actions were escalating.</p>

Examiners reward answers that explain the <strong>context</strong> &mdash; WWI trauma, sympathy for German grievances, fear of communism, economic weakness, and no American support.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Appeasement allowed Hitler to achieve his greatest ambitions without firing a shot. The Anschluss united Austria with Germany. Munich handed over the Sudetenland. Then in March 1939, Hitler broke his word and took the rest of Czechoslovakia &mdash; finally proving appeasement had failed. Britain pledged to defend Poland, and Europe moved towards war.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Appeasement had rational foundations:</strong> WWI trauma, sympathy for German grievances, economic weakness, fear of communism, and the need to rearm. It was not simple cowardice.</li>
          <li><strong>Each concession made the next crisis worse:</strong> The Anschluss went unopposed, emboldening Hitler over the Sudetenland. Munich showed that a democratic nation could be betrayed without its consent.</li>
          <li><strong>March 1939 was the turning point:</strong> Taking non-German Czechoslovakia proved Hitler could not be trusted. Britain dropped appeasement, the USSR lost faith in the West, and Stalin began looking for his own deal with Hitler.</li>
        </ul>
