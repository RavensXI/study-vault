        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">What Was Appeasement?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2"><dfn class="term" data-def="The policy of making concessions to an aggressor&rsquo;s demands in order to avoid conflict.">Appeasement</dfn> meant giving in to an aggressor&rsquo;s demands to avoid conflict. From 1937, it became the official policy of British Prime Minister <dfn class="term" data-def="British Prime Minister from May 1937 to May 1940.">Neville Chamberlain</dfn>, who believed many of Hitler&rsquo;s grievances were fair and that satisfying them would keep the peace.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">Why Was Appeasement Followed?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Appeasement was not cowardice. It was driven by powerful factors that made it seem the most sensible choice at the time.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n5">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Six Reasons for Appeasement</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fear of another war</strong> &mdash; The trauma of WWI was still vivid. Britain and France had lost 2.3 million soldiers combined. No leader wanted to repeat that.</li>
            <li><strong>The Treaty was seen as unfair</strong> &mdash; Many in Britain felt Germany had been treated too harshly at Versailles. Some of Hitler&rsquo;s demands &mdash; like reuniting German-speakers &mdash; seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li><strong>Fear of Communism</strong> &mdash; Some saw Hitler as a useful barrier against Soviet communism. A strong Germany could act as a buffer against Stalin.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic problems</strong> &mdash; The Great Depression had hit Britain and France hard. Neither felt it could afford war.</li>
            <li><strong>American isolationism</strong> &mdash; The USA had retreated into isolationism. Britain knew it could not count on American support.</li>
            <li><strong>Buying time to rearm</strong> &mdash; Britain&rsquo;s military was not ready for war. Some argue Chamberlain used appeasement to delay conflict while rebuilding the armed forces, especially the RAF.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n6">Case Study 1: <dfn class="term" data-def="The political union of Austria and Germany, achieved by Hitler in March 1938.">Anschluss</dfn> with Austria (March 1938)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">The Anschluss &mdash; the union of Germany and Austria &mdash; was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. Hitler had tried and failed in 1934, when Mussolini moved Italian troops to the Austrian border to stop him. By 1938, everything had changed: Italy was now Germany&rsquo;s ally through the Rome-Berlin Axis. Mussolini told Hitler that &ldquo;Austria did not interest him at all.&rdquo;</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n9">When Schuschnigg tried to hold a vote on Austrian independence, Hitler threatened invasion. Schuschnigg was forced to resign. On <strong>12 March 1938</strong>, German troops marched in and were met by cheering crowds.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n10">A rigged vote then claimed <strong>99.75% support</strong> for union with Germany. Britain and France only issued diplomatic protests. Churchill protested strongly, but the policy of appeasement prevented stronger action. Most people felt Austria was too far from Britain and too close to Germany for Britain to act.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n10c">Austria gave Germany a springboard for any future invasion of south-eastern Europe. Czechoslovakia&rsquo;s western provinces were now virtually surrounded by Germany on three sides. The Czechs were horrified &mdash; and had little faith that Britain and France would actually help them.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n10d">Over 80,000 &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; were rounded up in the first two weeks of occupation, and new laws restricted Jews. Hitler had now taken over another country without firing a shot &mdash; and his actions were escalating.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n15">Chamberlain flew to Germany three times to negotiate. On <strong>15 September</strong> at Berchtesgaden, Hitler demanded areas with over 50% German speakers. Chamberlain agreed and persuaded the Czechs to accept. On <strong>22 September</strong> at Bad Godesberg, Hitler raised his demands to <em>all</em> of the Sudetenland and staged fake reports of Czech atrocities. Chamberlain refused. The Royal Navy was put on high alert. Finally, on <strong>29 September</strong>, a conference was called at Munich.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n18"><strong>Czechoslovakia:</strong> The Czechs were devastated. They lost 20% of their land, including valuable resources and industries. They felt betrayed &mdash; they had not even been invited to the conference that decided their fate. To make things worse, Hungary and Poland also began demanding parts of Czechoslovakia.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n19"><strong>The USSR:</strong> Stalin was insulted he had not been invited. The USSR had an alliance with Czechoslovakia and would have been willing to act &mdash; but not without British and French support. Stalin suspected Britain and France were happy to let Hitler grow stronger in the east, so long as it did not threaten them. This pushed him towards a deal with Hitler.</p>

        <p>Do not dismiss appeasement as cowardly or stupid. Examiners reward answers that explain the <strong>context</strong> &mdash; WWI trauma, sympathy for German grievances, fear of communism, economic weakness, and no American support.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Appeasement allowed Hitler to achieve his greatest ambitions without firing a shot. The Anschluss united Austria with Germany. Munich handed over the Sudetenland. Then in March 1939, Hitler broke his word and took the rest of Czechoslovakia &mdash; finally proving appeasement had failed. Britain pledged to defend Poland, and Europe moved towards war.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Appeasement had rational foundations:</strong> WWI trauma, sympathy for German grievances, economic weakness, fear of communism, and the need to rearm. It was not simple cowardice.</li>
          <li><strong>Each concession made the next crisis worse:</strong> The Anschluss went unopposed, emboldening Hitler over the Sudetenland. Munich showed that a democratic nation could be betrayed without its consent.</li>
          <li><strong>March 1939 was the turning point:</strong> Taking non-German Czechoslovakia proved Hitler could not be trusted. Britain dropped appeasement, the USSR lost faith in the West, and Stalin began looking for his own deal with Hitler.</li>

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the Anschluss affected international relations at different stages.\nExample: Anschluss made other countries worried about what Hitler might do next. He had a stated aim of expanding in the east to gain Lebensraum. Britain and France agreed to support Czechoslovakia against Nazi pressure, and this led to Chamberlain\u2019s policy of appeasement. The Anschluss gave Germany control of Austria\u2019s iron, steel, and engineering industries as well as the Austrian Central Bank\u2019s gold reserves \u2014 strengthening Germany\u2019s war-making capacity. Czechoslovakia was now virtually surrounded by Germany on three sides, making it the obvious next target. The fact that Hitler had taken over another country without firing a shot \u2014 and Britain and France only issued diplomatic protests \u2014 convinced him the democracies would not fight.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge.

On 12 March 1938, German troops marched into Austria unopposed. A rigged plebiscite claimed 99.75% support. Britain and France only issued diplomatic protests. This emboldened Hitler to turn to Czechoslovakia next, since its western provinces were now surrounded by Germany on three sides. The Czechs were horrified and had little faith the Western powers would help them.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Germany took over Austria in March 1938. Hitler bullied Chancellor Schuschnigg into resigning and then sent troops in. Britain and France did not stop him. This made Hitler more confident and Czechoslovakia was the next target.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the crisis developed through different stages.\nExample: The crisis escalated through stages because Hitler\u2019s demands kept increasing and Chamberlain kept conceding. Hitler gave support to the Sudeten German Party under Konrad Henlein to demand self-government and claim persecution. France\u2019s alliance with Czechoslovakia might have meant war. Chamberlain went to visit Hitler twice and each time his demands increased. At Berchtesgaden (15 September) Hitler agreed to a plebiscite for areas with over 50% German speakers, but at Bad Godesberg (22 September) he demanded all of the Sudetenland and staged fake reports of Czech atrocities. It caused panic in Europe and the Royal Navy was put on high alert. Much depended on whether Chamberlain could persuade France to agree to pursue appeasement. The Munich conference (29 September) averted immediate conflict when Britain persuaded France and Czechoslovakia to agree to the transfer.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: The Sudetenland had about 3 million ethnic Germans, and Hitler encouraged Konrad Henlein\u2019s Sudeten German Party to demand self-government and claim they were being persecuted. This created riots and protests. Hitler told his generals to prepare to invade by 1 October 1938. Chamberlain flew to Berchtesgaden on 15 September and agreed to areas with over 50% German speakers joining Germany. But at Bad Godesberg on 22 September, Hitler raised his demands to the entire Sudetenland, creating a full international crisis.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: The Sudetenland had 3 million Germans and Hitler said they were being persecuted. Chamberlain flew to Germany to negotiate but Hitler kept raising his demands. Eventually the Munich Agreement gave Hitler the Sudetenland.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY March 1939 was a turning point.\nExample: The events of March 1939 ended appeasement because they exposed Hitler\u2019s promises as worthless. At Munich in September 1938, Hitler had declared he had \u2018no further territorial ambitions.\u2019 Six months later, he encouraged Slovakia to break away and then bullied the 66-year-old Czech President Hacha into handing over the rest of Czechoslovakia \u2014 Hacha likely suffered a heart attack during the meeting. This was a turning point because, for the first time, Hitler had taken over a country that was not mainly German-speaking. He could no longer claim he was simply \u2018uniting German speakers.\u2019 This was blatant aggression. Britain dropped appeasement, Chamberlain pledged to defend Poland, and rearmament increased. The British public now supported action because they felt everything possible had been done to keep the peace.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: In March 1939, Hitler broke his word from Munich by taking the rest of Czechoslovakia. He encouraged Slovakia to break away and then threatened President Hacha into agreeing to German occupation. This ended appeasement because it was the first time Hitler had taken over non-German-speaking territory. It proved his promises were lies.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: Appeasement was a major cause of the war because it emboldened Hitler at every stage. Chamberlain believed Hitler had limited aims, but the Munich Agreement (September 1938) handed him the Sudetenland \u2014 including Czechoslovakia\u2019s border fortifications, coal deposits, and the Skoda arms works \u2014 without Czechoslovakia or the USSR even being invited. When Hitler broke his word and took the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, it proved appeasement had failed. However, appeasement was itself a product of deeper pressures: WWI trauma (2.3 million British and French soldiers killed), fear of communism, economic weakness, and American isolationism. Hitler\u2019s aggressive foreign policy was the driving force \u2014 his aims from Mein Kampf (Lebensraum, destroying Versailles, uniting German speakers) made conflict likely regardless of Allied policy. The Nazi-Soviet Pact (August 1939) freed Hitler from a two-front war and led directly to the invasion of Poland. Appeasement enabled Hitler, but his own ambitions caused the war.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Appeasement was the main reason because Britain and France repeatedly gave in to Hitler\u2019s demands. The Anschluss (March 1938) went unopposed. At Munich (September 1938), Chamberlain and Daladier handed over the entire Sudetenland. Chamberlain declared \u2018peace for our time\u2019 but Hitler broke his word within six months. Each concession made Hitler bolder and convinced him the Allies would never fight.\nExample (other factor): Hitler\u2019s aggressive foreign policy was also crucial. His aims from Mein Kampf went beyond reversing Versailles \u2014 he wanted Lebensraum in Eastern Europe. He used Konrad Henlein\u2019s Sudeten German Party to manufacture a crisis, told his generals to prepare to invade by 1 October 1938, and staged fake reports of Czech atrocities. Hitler was driving events, not just responding to Allied weakness.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Appeasement caused the war because Chamberlain kept giving in to Hitler. At Munich he handed over the Sudetenland without even inviting Czechoslovakia. This made Hitler think he could take anything he wanted.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Appeasement let Hitler get away with everything. / Hitler\u2019s own ambitions caused the war.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: Hitler\u2019s aggressive foreign policy was the central cause of the war. His aims from Mein Kampf \u2014 abolishing the Treaty of Versailles, Lebensraum, uniting German speakers, and Aryan supremacy \u2014 drove a systematic programme of expansion. He used Konrad Henlein to manufacture the Sudetenland crisis, told his generals to prepare to invade Czechoslovakia by 1 October 1938, and broke his word within six months by taking the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. However, other factors enabled his aggression. Appeasement \u2014 driven by WWI trauma, sympathy for German grievances, fear of communism, and economic weakness \u2014 meant Britain and France repeatedly conceded. Chamberlain believed Hitler had limited aims; the Munich Agreement proved him wrong. The Treaty of Versailles created the resentment Hitler exploited. The Nazi-Soviet Pact (August 1939) freed him from a two-front war. Hitler\u2019s ambitions were the driving force, but appeasement and Allied disunity allowed those ambitions to succeed.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Hitler\u2019s aggressive foreign policy was the main reason because he systematically expanded German territory. He achieved the Anschluss with Austria (March 1938), then used Konrad Henlein\u2019s Sudeten German Party to create a crisis in Czechoslovakia. He demanded the Sudetenland, staged fake atrocity reports, and prepared to invade by 1 October 1938. At Munich he got everything, then broke his word by taking the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. Finally he invaded Poland in September 1939.\nExample (other factor): Appeasement was also a main cause. Chamberlain flew to Germany three times during the Sudetenland crisis and made concessions each time. At Munich, he and Daladier handed over the Sudetenland without even inviting Czechoslovakia or the USSR. Chamberlain declared \u2018peace for our time\u2019 but had emboldened Hitler to make even greater demands.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Hitler\u2019s aggressive foreign policy caused the war because he kept taking more territory. He took Austria in 1938, the Sudetenland in 1938, and then the rest of Czechoslovakia in 1939. His invasion of Poland started the war.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Hitler kept invading countries which led to war. / Appeasement let Hitler get too strong.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.

Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: The Nazi-Soviet Pact (August 1939) was the immediate trigger for war because its secret clause to divide Poland freed Hitler from the nightmare of a two-front war. Once Stalin agreed, Hitler invaded Poland within a week. The Pact shocked Britain and France and destroyed any hope of an anti-Hitler alliance including the USSR. However, the Pact was itself a product of earlier failures. Stalin distrusted the West after Munich \u2014 the USSR had not been invited to the conference that decided Czechoslovakia\u2019s fate, convincing Stalin that Britain and France were happy to let Hitler expand eastward. Appeasement had emboldened Hitler through years of concessions (Rhineland, Anschluss, Sudetenland). Hitler\u2019s aggressive foreign policy \u2014 rooted in Mein Kampf\u2019s aims of Lebensraum and destroying Versailles \u2014 was the underlying cause. The Pact was the final piece that made war in September 1939 possible, but the foundations had been laid over the preceding six years.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The Nazi-Soviet Pact was the main reason because it freed Hitler from a two-front war. The secret clause agreed to divide Poland between Germany and the USSR. Once the Pact was signed in August 1939, Hitler invaded Poland on 1 September, knowing the USSR would not intervene. Stalin had been pushed towards the deal after being excluded from the Munich conference \u2014 he suspected Britain and France wanted Hitler to expand eastward.\nExample (other factor): Appeasement was also a key cause. Chamberlain\u2019s policy of concessions \u2014 accepting the Anschluss, handing over the Sudetenland at Munich, and declaring \u2018peace for our time\u2019 \u2014 emboldened Hitler to make ever-greater demands. When Hitler broke his word and took the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, it proved appeasement had failed. But by then Hitler was strong enough to act, and the Pact removed the last obstacle.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The Nazi-Soviet Pact caused the war because it let Hitler invade Poland without worrying about the USSR attacking from the east. Stalin agreed because he did not trust Britain and France after Munich. Hitler invaded Poland a week later.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The Nazi-Soviet Pact meant Hitler could invade Poland. / Appeasement had already made Hitler too powerful.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.
