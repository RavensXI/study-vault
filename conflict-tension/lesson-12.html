        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">What Was Appeasement?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2"><dfn class="term" data-def="The policy of making concessions to an aggressor&rsquo;s demands in order to avoid conflict. In the 1930s, it became the official British foreign policy under Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who believed that satisfying Hitler&rsquo;s &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; demands would prevent another devastating war.">Appeasement</dfn> was the policy of giving in to an aggressor&rsquo;s demands in order to avoid conflict. From 1937, it became the official foreign policy of British Prime Minister <dfn class="term" data-def="British Prime Minister from May 1937 to May 1940. He is most closely associated with the policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany, particularly the Munich Agreement of September 1938. He declared war on Germany in September 1939 after Hitler invaded Poland.">Neville Chamberlain</dfn>, who believed that many of Hitler&rsquo;s grievances were legitimate and that satisfying them would preserve peace in Europe.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">Why Was Appeasement Followed?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Appeasement was not the result of cowardice or naivety. It was driven by a combination of powerful factors that made it seem like the most moral and pragmatic choice available in the late 1930s.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n5">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Six Reasons for Appeasement</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fear of another war</strong> &mdash; The trauma of World War One was still vivid. Britain and France had lost a combined 2.3 million soldiers. No leader wanted to repeat that slaughter.</li>
            <li><strong>The Treaty was seen as unfair</strong> &mdash; Many in Britain believed Germany had been treated too harshly at Versailles. Some of Hitler&rsquo;s demands &mdash; such as reuniting German-speakers &mdash; seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li><strong>Fear of Communism</strong> &mdash; Hitler was seen by some as a useful barrier against the spread of Soviet communism. A strong Germany could serve as a buffer against Stalin.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic problems</strong> &mdash; The Great Depression had devastated the British and French economies. Neither country felt it could afford the enormous cost of war.</li>
            <li><strong>American isolationism</strong> &mdash; The USA had retreated into isolationism after World War One. Britain knew it could not count on American support and feared fighting a major war alone.</li>
            <li><strong>Buying time to rearm</strong> &mdash; Britain&rsquo;s military was not ready for war. Some argue Chamberlain used appeasement to delay conflict while Britain rebuilt its armed forces, particularly the RAF.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n6">Case Study 1: <dfn class="term" data-def="The political union of Austria and Germany, achieved by Hitler in March 1938. German troops marched into Austria unopposed on 12 March, and a rigged plebiscite subsequently showed 99.75% support. It was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles but Britain and France took no action to prevent it.">Anschluss</dfn> with Austria (March 1938)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">The Anschluss &mdash; the union of Germany and Austria &mdash; had been one of Hitler&rsquo;s earliest ambitions and was explicitly forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. In March 1938, he achieved it through a combination of internal subversion, diplomatic bullying, and military threat.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">Emboldened by the Anschluss, Hitler turned his attention to Czechoslovakia.

        <p>Do not simply dismiss appeasement as cowardly or stupid. Examiners reward answers that explain the <strong>historical context</strong> &mdash; the trauma of WWI, genuine sympathy for German grievances, fear of communism, economic weakness, and the absence of American support. In 1938, appeasement seemed like both a moral and a pragmatic choice to many people. Show you understand <em>why</em> it was followed before you evaluate whether it was the right decision.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n22">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The policy of appeasement, born from the trauma of the First World War and sustained by a combination of fear, sympathy, and strategic calculation, allowed Hitler to achieve two of his greatest ambitions without firing a shot. The Anschluss united Austria with Germany, and the Munich Agreement handed over the Sudetenland &mdash; betraying a democratic nation, alienating the USSR, and convincing Hitler that the Western democracies would never stand up to him.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Appeasement had rational foundations:</strong> It was driven by WWI trauma, sympathy for German grievances, economic weakness, fear of communism, and the need to buy time for rearmament &mdash; not simply weakness or naivety.</li>
          <li><strong>Each concession made the next crisis worse:</strong> The Anschluss went unopposed, which emboldened Hitler over the Sudetenland. Munich then demonstrated that even a democratic nation&rsquo;s territorial integrity could be bargained away without its consent.</li>
          <li><strong>Munich&rsquo;s consequences extended beyond Czechoslovakia:</strong> Excluding the USSR from the conference deepened Soviet distrust of the Western powers and pushed Stalin towards an agreement with Hitler &mdash; a decision that would reshape the path to war.</li>
        </ul>
