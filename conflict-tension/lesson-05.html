        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The League of Nations</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The <dfn class="term" data-def="An international organisation founded in 1920 as part of the Treaty of Versailles, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.">League of Nations</dfn> was founded in 1920, based in Geneva, Switzerland. It was President Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s idea &mdash; he believed an international body could prevent future wars through cooperation. It started with <strong>42 members</strong>, rising to <strong>58 by 1934</strong>. However, the League was badly weakened from the start when the <strong>USA refused to join</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The League&rsquo;s Four Aims</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Stop war</strong> through <dfn class="term" data-def="The principle that peace is maintained by countries acting together to deter or prevent aggression.">collective security</dfn></li>
            <li><strong>Improve lives</strong> &mdash; better working conditions, health, and social welfare</li>
            <li><strong>Achieve <dfn class="term" data-def="The reduction or withdrawal of military forces and weapons.">disarmament</dfn></strong> &mdash; reduce weapons to prevent future wars</li>
            <li><strong>Enforce the Treaty of Versailles</strong> &mdash; uphold the post-war settlement</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n29">All members signed up to the <dfn class="term" data-def="The founding charter of the League of Nations, included as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles.">Covenant</dfn> &mdash; a set of promises. They agreed to respect other members&rsquo; territory, take disputes to the League, work together for <dfn class="term" data-def="The principle that peace is maintained by countries acting together to deter or prevent aggression.">collective security</dfn>, reduce weapons, and support the Court of International Justice.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n30">What Did the Big Three Want?</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n31"><strong>Wilson</strong> wanted a powerful world parliament where all nations would discuss problems and make decisions together. <strong>Clemenceau</strong> wanted a strong League with its own army to protect countries from aggressors. <strong>Lloyd George</strong> wanted a simpler body that could handle emergencies &mdash; but without too much power over Britain.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Structure of the League</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">The League&rsquo;s structure was a <strong>compromise</strong> between these views. It gave every nation a voice, but also let the major powers keep control. In practice, its systems made quick action very difficult.</p>

        <figure class="diagram" data-narration-id="n6">
          <img src="diagram_league_structure.png" alt="Diagram showing the structure of the League of Nations — The Assembly, The Council, the Permanent Court of International Justice, the Secretariat, and the specialist Commissions and Agencies">
        </figure>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">The Assembly</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">Every member nation had one vote in the Assembly. It met once a year to discuss major issues and set the budget. All decisions had to be <dfn class="term" data-def="Complete agreement by all members.">unanimous</dfn> &mdash; every single member had to agree. This made it very slow to reach decisions.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">The Council</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">The Council was smaller and more powerful. It met several times a year, and in emergencies. It had <strong>4 permanent members</strong> &mdash; Britain, France, Italy, and Japan &mdash; each with <dfn class="term" data-def="The power held by permanent members of the League's Council to reject or block any decision.">veto</dfn> power, meaning any one of them could block any decision. Temporary members were elected on a rotating basis.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n11">Permanent Court of International Justice</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">Based at The Hague in the Netherlands, this court settled legal disputes between nations. However, it had <strong>no way to enforce</strong> its rulings &mdash; countries could simply ignore its decisions.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n13">The Secretariat</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">The Secretariat was the League&rsquo;s civil service. It organised meetings, kept records, and prepared reports for the Assembly and Council.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n15">Commissions and Agencies</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n16">The League ran several specialist bodies. The <strong>International Labour Organisation (ILO)</strong> improved working conditions worldwide. The <strong>Health Committee</strong> fought diseases like malaria. The <strong>Slavery Commission</strong> worked to end forced labour. The <strong>Refugees Commission</strong> helped displaced people return home. These were among the League&rsquo;s greatest achievements.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n17">Powers: Collective Security in Practice</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">The League&rsquo;s main tool for keeping peace was collective security &mdash; all members acting together against any aggressor. The Covenant set out a three-step process:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n19">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Three Steps of Collective Security</div>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Moral Condemnation</strong> &mdash; the League would publicly condemn the aggressor and order them to stop</li>
            <li><strong>Economic <dfn class="term" data-def="Penalties imposed on a country by other nations, typically involving trade restrictions or financial penalties.">Sanctions</dfn></strong> &mdash; member nations would refuse to trade with the aggressor, damaging their economy</li>
            <li><strong>Military Force</strong> &mdash; as a last resort, member nations would contribute armed forces to stop the aggressor</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n20">Fatal Flaws</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">The League had one critical weakness: <strong>it had no army of its own</strong>. Every step relied on member nations choosing to help &mdash; and they were often unwilling to send troops or damage their own trade. Some historians called the League &ldquo;toothless&rdquo;.</p>

            <span>Why was the League structurally flawed?</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>

              <p data-narration-id="n22"><strong>Absent USA:</strong> Wilson lost the 1920 election to Warren Harding, who adopted a policy of <dfn class="term" data-def="A policy of remaining apart from the affairs of other countries.">isolationism</dfn>. Many Americans were against joining &mdash; they did not want to be dragged into foreign wars, some had German or Irish roots and resented the Allies, and business interests opposed trade restrictions. Without the world&rsquo;s richest and most powerful nation, the League was weakened in three ways:</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n32"><strong>Weakened economically</strong> &mdash; sanctions could not work properly because the USA, the world&rsquo;s richest country, could keep trading with aggressors. <strong>Weakened militarily</strong> &mdash; the League could not call on America&rsquo;s huge army. <strong>Weakened politically</strong> &mdash; it was America&rsquo;s idea, yet they refused to join. No one really wanted to lead.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n23"><strong>Unanimity requirement:</strong> Both the Assembly and Council needed every member to agree. One country could block any action, making fast responses almost impossible.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n24"><strong>Veto power:</strong> Permanent Council members could block any decision on their own, so self-interested nations could stop the League acting against them or their allies.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n25"><strong>No standing army:</strong> Military action relied on members choosing to send troops. No country wanted to fight in distant wars that did not threaten them directly.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n26"><strong>Sanctions were leaky:</strong> Non-members like the USA could keep trading with aggressors, making economic penalties useless.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n33"><strong>Banned members:</strong> The <strong>USSR</strong> was banned because it was communist &mdash; Western nations saw it as a threat. <strong>Germany</strong> was banned until it proved it was peaceful. This made the League look like a &ldquo;winners&rsquo; club&rdquo; and left out major world powers.</p>

        <p>Don&rsquo;t just describe the League&rsquo;s structure &mdash; explain how each part was flawed. For example, the combination of unanimous voting and veto power made decisive action almost impossible. Linking structure to weakness shows the analytical thinking examiners reward.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n28">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The League aimed to prevent war, improve lives, and build a new world order through cooperation. But it was crippled from birth by structural flaws and the absence of the world&rsquo;s most powerful nation.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The USA&rsquo;s absence was the League&rsquo;s greatest weakness:</strong> Without American money and military power, sanctions were leaky, no one could enforce decisions, and no country wanted to lead.</li>
          <li><strong>Structure guaranteed inaction:</strong> Unanimous voting, veto power, and no army meant the League could spot problems but rarely solve them.</li>
          <li><strong>Key members were missing:</strong> The USA refused to join, the USSR and Germany were banned. This left Britain and France in charge &mdash; but neither truly wanted the role.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the structural problems interacted to make the League ineffective.\nExample: The League\u2019s structure was a compromise between what Wilson, Clemenceau, and Lloyd George wanted, and this left it fatally flawed. The Assembly had 42 members (rising to 58 by 1934) but required unanimous votes and met only once a year, making fast decisions impossible. The Council was smaller and met in emergencies, but its 4 permanent members \u2014 Britain, France, Italy, and Japan \u2014 each held veto power, meaning any one could block action to protect its own interests. Most critically, the League had no army of its own. Its three-step enforcement process (moral condemnation, economic sanctions, military force) relied entirely on member nations choosing to act \u2014 and they were often unwilling to send troops or damage their own trade.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: The unanimity requirement in both the Assembly and Council was a major problem. Every single member had to agree before action could be taken, which meant one country could block any decision. The Assembly met only once a year with 42 members, making quick responses to crises almost impossible. This structural weakness meant the League could identify problems but rarely act fast enough to solve them.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: The Council\u2019s permanent members had veto power, so Britain, France, Italy, or Japan could block any decision on their own. This meant self-interested nations could stop the League acting against them or their allies.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: The League needed every country to agree before it could do anything. / The League had no army of its own.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY American absence created multiple connected weaknesses.\nExample: The USA\u2019s absence weakened the League economically, militarily, and politically. Wilson lost the 1920 election to Harding, who adopted isolationism \u2014 many Americans did not want to be dragged into foreign wars, some had German or Irish roots and resented the Allies, and business interests opposed trade restrictions. Without the world\u2019s richest nation, economic sanctions were useless because aggressors could keep trading with America. Without America\u2019s army, military threats were empty. Most damaging was the political weakness: the League was Wilson\u2019s own creation, yet his country refused to join. This meant no major power truly wanted to lead, leaving Britain and France in charge \u2014 but neither was willing to take on that responsibility.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: The USA\u2019s absence damaged the League economically because sanctions could not work properly. The USA was the world\u2019s richest country, and as a non-member it could continue trading with any aggressor nation. This meant economic penalties were leaky and ineffective. Without American money and trade power behind them, sanctions were the League\u2019s best tool but they were fundamentally broken.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: The USA refused to join because Congress would not ratify the Treaty of Versailles. Many Americans supported isolationism and did not want to get involved in European problems. This left Britain and France to run the League, but neither truly wanted the responsibility.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the League\u2019s methods were meant to work together but were undermined in practice.\nExample: The League aimed to prevent war through collective security \u2014 all members acting together against any aggressor. The Covenant set out a three-step process: first moral condemnation (publicly ordering the aggressor to stop), then economic sanctions (members refusing to trade with the aggressor), and finally military force as a last resort. Additionally, the League aimed to achieve disarmament and improve lives through agencies like the ILO and Health Committee, addressing the root causes of conflict. However, the system relied entirely on member nations choosing to help. Without its own army, and with non-members like the USA free to keep trading with aggressors, the League\u2019s enforcement tools were hollow from the start.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: The League\u2019s main method was collective security. All members signed the Covenant, promising to respect other members\u2019 territory, take disputes to the League, and work together. If a nation attacked another, the League would first condemn the aggressor, then impose economic sanctions, and finally use military force. The Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague could also settle legal disputes between nations.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: The League had four aims: stop war through collective security, improve lives, achieve disarmament, and enforce the Treaty of Versailles. It used commissions like the ILO to improve working conditions and the Health Committee to fight diseases like malaria.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: The issue of organisation was as much of a problem because of the number of countries that were included as it was because of the countries that were left out. The conduct of the permanent members of the Council acting in self-interest was a primary cause of failure. This was compounded by the economic weakness due to the absence of the USA. The unanimity requirement and veto power meant the League could spot problems but rarely solve them, while the lack of a standing army left enforcement entirely dependent on members who were often unwilling to act.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The way the League was organised made it difficult for any decision or action to be taken quickly. The Assembly had 42 members and only met once a year, requiring unanimous votes. Motions could be vetoed by the Council\u2019s permanent members (Britain, France, Italy, Japan). The Permanent Court of International Justice had no way to enforce its rulings.\nExample (other factor): The actions of the permanent members undermined League authority. The USA refused to join despite Wilson creating the League. The USSR was banned because it was communist, and Germany was excluded. This left the League looking like a \u2018winners\u2019 club\u2019 that was missing major world powers.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The League had no army of its own, which was a major structural flaw. Military action relied on members choosing to send troops, but no country wanted to fight in distant wars that did not threaten them directly. This made the threat of force empty.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The League needed everyone to agree before it could act. / The USA did not join the League.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: The USA\u2019s absence was the single most damaging factor because it weakened the League in three interconnected ways. Economically, sanctions were useless since the world\u2019s richest nation could keep trading with aggressors. Militarily, the League could not call on America\u2019s huge army. Politically, it was Wilson\u2019s creation yet his own country refused to join, meaning no one truly wanted to lead. However, even with the USA the League\u2019s structural flaws would have limited its effectiveness. The unanimity requirement, veto power, and no standing army meant decisive action was almost impossible by design. Both the absent USA and the flawed structure worked together to cripple the League.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The USA\u2019s absence was hugely damaging because it weakened sanctions. The USA was the world\u2019s richest country, and without its participation any aggressor could simply trade with America, rendering economic penalties meaningless. Wilson lost the 1920 election to Harding, who adopted isolationism. Many Americans opposed joining because they did not want to be dragged into foreign wars.\nExample (other factor): The League\u2019s structure was also fundamentally flawed. The unanimity requirement meant one country could block any decision. The Council\u2019s permanent members had veto power, allowing self-interested nations to protect themselves or their allies. The Permanent Court at The Hague had no way to enforce its rulings.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Other missing members also weakened the League. The USSR was banned because it was communist, and Germany was excluded until it proved it was peaceful. This made the League look like a \u2018winners\u2019 club\u2019 and left out major world powers who could have strengthened it.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors.

The real weakness was the combination of no army AND a decision-making structure designed to prevent action.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The League had no standing army, so military action depended entirely on members choosing to send troops. No country wanted to fight in wars that did not threaten them directly. Clemenceau had originally wanted the League to have its own army, but Lloyd George rejected this. The result was that the threat of force was empty.\nExample (other factor): Economic sanctions were also fatally weak because the USA \u2014 the world\u2019s richest country \u2014 was not a member. Any aggressor could keep trading with America, making sanctions useless. The League started with 42 members but key powers like the USA, USSR, and Germany were missing, further weakening its authority.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The decision-making process also prevented the League from keeping peace. Both the Assembly and Council required unanimous votes, meaning any single member could block action. The Council\u2019s permanent members also held veto power. This made fast responses to crises almost impossible.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The League had no army so it could not force countries to obey. / Countries could ignore the League because it had no power.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."
