        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The League of Nations</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The <dfn class="term" data-def="An international organisation founded in 1920 as part of the Treaty of Versailles, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. Its purpose was to maintain world peace through collective security, disarmament, and negotiation. It was weakened from the start by the USA's refusal to join.">League of Nations</dfn> was founded in 1920, based in Geneva, Switzerland. It was President Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s idea &mdash; he believed an international body could prevent future wars through cooperation. It started with <strong>42 members</strong>, rising to <strong>58 by 1934</strong>. However, the League was badly weakened from the start when the <strong>USA refused to join</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The League&rsquo;s Four Aims</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Stop war</strong> through <dfn class="term" data-def="The principle that peace is maintained by countries acting together to deter or prevent aggression. If one nation attacked another, all League members would unite against the aggressor through diplomatic, economic, or military action.">collective security</dfn></li>
            <li><strong>Improve lives</strong> &mdash; better working conditions, health, and social welfare</li>
            <li><strong>Achieve <dfn class="term" data-def="The reduction or withdrawal of military forces and weapons. The League aimed to persuade all nations to reduce their armed forces to the lowest level needed for domestic safety.">disarmament</dfn></strong> &mdash; reduce weapons to prevent future wars</li>
            <li><strong>Enforce the Treaty of Versailles</strong> &mdash; uphold the post-war settlement</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n29">All members signed up to the <dfn class="term" data-def="The founding charter of the League of Nations, included as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles. It set out the rules and principles by which the League would operate, including the commitment to collective security.">Covenant</dfn> &mdash; a set of promises. They agreed to respect other members&rsquo; territory, take disputes to the League, work together for <dfn class="term" data-def="The principle that peace is maintained by countries acting together to deter or prevent aggression. If one nation attacked another, all League members would unite against the aggressor through diplomatic, economic, or military action.">collective security</dfn>, reduce weapons, and support the Court of International Justice.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n30">What Did the Big Three Want?</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n31"><strong>Wilson</strong> wanted a powerful world parliament where all nations would discuss problems and make decisions together. <strong>Clemenceau</strong> wanted a strong League with its own army to protect countries from aggressors. <strong>Lloyd George</strong> wanted a simpler body that could handle emergencies &mdash; but without too much power over Britain.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Structure of the League</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">The League&rsquo;s structure was a <strong>compromise</strong> between these views. It gave every nation a voice, but also let the major powers keep control. In practice, its systems made quick action very difficult.</p>

        <figure class="diagram" data-narration-id="n6">
          <img src="diagram_league_structure.png" alt="Diagram showing the structure of the League of Nations — The Assembly, The Council, the Permanent Court of International Justice, the Secretariat, and the specialist Commissions and Agencies">
        </figure>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">The Assembly</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">Every member nation had one vote in the Assembly. It met once a year to discuss major issues and set the budget. All decisions had to be <dfn class="term" data-def="Complete agreement by all members. The League of Nations required unanimous decisions in the Assembly and Council, meaning any single member could block action. This made it extremely difficult to respond quickly to international crises.">unanimous</dfn> &mdash; every single member had to agree. This made it very slow to reach decisions.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">The Council</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">The Council was smaller and more powerful. It met several times a year, and in emergencies. It had <strong>4 permanent members</strong> &mdash; Britain, France, Italy, and Japan &mdash; each with <dfn class="term" data-def="The power held by permanent members of the League's Council to reject or block any decision. A single veto from any permanent member could prevent the League from taking action, regardless of what other members wanted.">veto</dfn> power, meaning any one of them could block any decision. Temporary members were elected on a rotating basis.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n11">Permanent Court of International Justice</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">Based at The Hague in the Netherlands, this court settled legal disputes between nations. However, it had <strong>no way to enforce</strong> its rulings &mdash; countries could simply ignore its decisions.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n13">The Secretariat</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">The Secretariat was the League&rsquo;s civil service. It organised meetings, kept records, and prepared reports for the Assembly and Council.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n15">Commissions and Agencies</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n16">The League ran several specialist bodies. The <strong>International Labour Organisation (ILO)</strong> improved working conditions worldwide. The <strong>Health Committee</strong> fought diseases like malaria. The <strong>Slavery Commission</strong> worked to end forced labour. The <strong>Refugees Commission</strong> helped displaced people return home. These were among the League&rsquo;s greatest achievements.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n17">Powers: Collective Security in Practice</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">The League&rsquo;s main tool for keeping peace was collective security &mdash; all members acting together against any aggressor. The Covenant set out a three-step process:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n19">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Three Steps of Collective Security</div>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Moral Condemnation</strong> &mdash; the League would publicly condemn the aggressor and order them to stop</li>
            <li><strong>Economic <dfn class="term" data-def="Penalties imposed on a country by other nations, typically involving trade restrictions or financial penalties. The League of Nations could impose economic sanctions on aggressive nations, but enforcing them relied entirely on member cooperation.">Sanctions</dfn></strong> &mdash; member nations would refuse to trade with the aggressor, damaging their economy</li>
            <li><strong>Military Force</strong> &mdash; as a last resort, member nations would contribute armed forces to stop the aggressor</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n20">Fatal Flaws</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">The League had one critical weakness: <strong>it had no army of its own</strong>. Every step relied on member nations choosing to help &mdash; and they were often unwilling to send troops or damage their own trade. Some historians called the League &ldquo;toothless&rdquo;.</p>

        <div class="collapsible">

            <span>Why was the League structurally flawed?</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n22"><strong>Absent USA:</strong> Wilson lost the 1920 election to Warren Harding, who adopted a policy of <dfn class="term" data-def="A policy of remaining apart from the affairs of other countries. After World War One, many Americans wanted to avoid being dragged into European problems and focus on their own country instead.">isolationism</dfn>. Many Americans were against joining &mdash; they did not want to be dragged into foreign wars, some had German or Irish roots and resented the Allies, and business interests opposed trade restrictions. Without the world&rsquo;s richest and most powerful nation, the League was weakened in three ways:</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n32"><strong>Weakened economically</strong> &mdash; sanctions could not work properly because the USA, the world&rsquo;s richest country, could keep trading with aggressors. <strong>Weakened militarily</strong> &mdash; the League could not call on America&rsquo;s huge army. <strong>Weakened politically</strong> &mdash; it was America&rsquo;s idea, yet they refused to join. No one really wanted to lead.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n23"><strong>Unanimity requirement:</strong> Both the Assembly and Council needed every member to agree. One country could block any action, making fast responses almost impossible.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n24"><strong>Veto power:</strong> Permanent Council members could block any decision on their own, so self-interested nations could stop the League acting against them or their allies.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n25"><strong>No standing army:</strong> Military action relied on members choosing to send troops. No country wanted to fight in distant wars that did not threaten them directly.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n26"><strong>Sanctions were leaky:</strong> Non-members like the USA could keep trading with aggressors, making economic penalties useless.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n33"><strong>Banned members:</strong> The <strong>USSR</strong> was banned because it was communist &mdash; Western nations saw it as a threat. <strong>Germany</strong> was banned until it proved it was peaceful. This made the League look like a &ldquo;winners&rsquo; club&rdquo; and left out major world powers.</p>

        <p>Don&rsquo;t just describe the League&rsquo;s structure &mdash; explain how each part was flawed. For example, the combination of unanimous voting and veto power made decisive action almost impossible. Linking structure to weakness shows the analytical thinking examiners reward.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n28">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The League aimed to prevent war, improve lives, and build a new world order through cooperation. But it was crippled from birth by structural flaws and the absence of the world&rsquo;s most powerful nation.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The USA&rsquo;s absence was the League&rsquo;s greatest weakness:</strong> Without American money and military power, sanctions were leaky, no one could enforce decisions, and no country wanted to lead.</li>
          <li><strong>Structure guaranteed inaction:</strong> Unanimous voting, veto power, and no army meant the League could spot problems but rarely solve them.</li>
          <li><strong>Key members were missing:</strong> The USA refused to join, the USSR and Germany were banned. This left Britain and France in charge &mdash; but neither truly wanted the role.</li>
        </ul>
