        <p data-narration-id="n2">The <dfn class="term" data-def="An international organisation founded in 1920 as part of the Treaty of Versailles, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. Its purpose was to maintain world peace through collective security, disarmament, and negotiation. It was weakened from the start by the USA's refusal to join.">League of Nations</dfn> was founded in 1920, with its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. It was the brainchild of President Woodrow Wilson, who believed an international organisation could prevent future wars through cooperation rather than conflict. However, the League was critically damaged from the outset when the <strong>USA refused to join</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The League&rsquo;s Four Aims</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Stop war</strong> through <dfn class="term" data-def="The principle that peace is maintained by countries acting together to deter or prevent aggression. If one nation attacked another, all League members would unite against the aggressor through diplomatic, economic, or military action.">collective security</dfn></li>
            <li><strong>Improve lives</strong> &mdash; better working conditions, health, and social welfare</li>
            <li><strong>Achieve <dfn class="term" data-def="The reduction or withdrawal of military forces and weapons. The League aimed to persuade all nations to reduce their armed forces to the lowest level needed for domestic safety.">disarmament</dfn></strong> &mdash; reduce weapons to prevent future wars</li>
            <li><strong>Enforce the Treaty of Versailles</strong> &mdash; uphold the post-war settlement</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Structure of the League</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">The League&rsquo;s structure was designed to enable collective decision-making, but in practice its mechanisms made decisive action extremely difficult. Understanding the structure reveals why the League often failed to respond quickly to crises.</p>

        <figure class="diagram" data-narration-id="n6">
          <img src="diagram_league_structure.png" alt="Diagram showing the structure of the League of Nations — The Assembly, The Council, the Permanent Court of International Justice, the Secretariat, and the specialist Commissions and Agencies">
        </figure>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">The Assembly</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">The Assembly was the League&rsquo;s parliament, where every member nation had one vote. It met annually to discuss major issues and set the League&rsquo;s budget. Crucially, decisions required <dfn class="term" data-def="Complete agreement by all members. The League of Nations required unanimous decisions in the Assembly and Council, meaning any single member could block action. This made it extremely difficult to respond quickly to international crises.">unanimity</dfn> &mdash; every member had to agree &mdash; making it extremely slow and difficult to reach decisions on controversial matters.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">The Council</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">The Council was a smaller, more powerful body that met more frequently to deal with crises. It had <strong>permanent members</strong> &mdash; Britain, France, Italy, and Japan &mdash; each holding <dfn class="term" data-def="The power held by permanent members of the League's Council to reject or block any decision. A single veto from any permanent member could prevent the League from taking action, regardless of what other members wanted.">veto</dfn> power, meaning any one of them could block any decision. Temporary members were elected by the Assembly to serve on a rotating basis.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n11">Permanent Court of International Justice</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">Based at The Hague in the Netherlands, this court was designed to settle legal disputes between nations. However, it had no means of <strong>enforcing</strong> its rulings &mdash; nations could simply ignore its judgements without consequence.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n13">The Secretariat</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">The Secretariat was the League&rsquo;s civil service, responsible for administration, record-keeping, and preparing reports for the Assembly and Council. It carried out the day-to-day work of the organisation.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n15">Commissions and Agencies</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n16">The League operated several specialist bodies that achieved some genuine success. The <strong>International Labour Organisation (ILO)</strong> worked to improve working conditions worldwide. The <strong>Health Committee</strong> combated disease. The <strong>Slavery Commission</strong> fought to end forced labour. These humanitarian efforts were among the League&rsquo;s most positive achievements.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n17">Powers: Collective Security in Practice</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">The League&rsquo;s main tool for keeping peace was collective security &mdash; the idea that all members would act together against any aggressor. The <dfn class="term" data-def="The founding charter of the League of Nations, included as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles. It set out the rules and principles by which the League would operate, including the commitment to collective security.">Covenant</dfn> of the League set out a three-step process for dealing with aggression:</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n19">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Three Steps of Collective Security</div>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Moral Condemnation</strong> &mdash; the League would publicly condemn the aggressor and order them to stop</li>
            <li><strong>Economic <dfn class="term" data-def="Penalties imposed on a country by other nations, typically involving trade restrictions or financial penalties. The League of Nations could impose economic sanctions on aggressive nations, but enforcing them relied entirely on member cooperation.">Sanctions</dfn></strong> &mdash; member nations would refuse to trade with the aggressor, damaging their economy</li>
            <li><strong>Military Force</strong> &mdash; as a last resort, member nations would contribute armed forces to stop the aggressor</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n20">Fatal Flaws</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">The League&rsquo;s collective security system suffered from a critical weakness: <strong>it had no army of its own</strong>. Every step of enforcement relied entirely on the goodwill and cooperation of member nations, who were often reluctant to commit troops or damage their own trade.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n23"><strong>Unanimity requirement:</strong> Both the Assembly and Council required unanimous agreement. Any single member could block action, making swift responses to crises virtually impossible.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n24"><strong>Veto power:</strong> Permanent Council members could individually block any decision, meaning self-interested nations could prevent the League from acting against them or their allies.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n25"><strong>No standing army:</strong> Military action required members to voluntarily contribute forces. In practice, no nation wanted to send its soldiers to fight in distant conflicts that did not directly threaten its own interests.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n26"><strong>Sanctions were leaky:</strong> Non-member nations &mdash; including the USA &mdash; were not bound by League sanctions and could continue trading with aggressors, rendering economic penalties ineffective.</p>

        <p>Don&rsquo;t just describe the League&rsquo;s structure &mdash; explain how it was flawed.

Linking structure to weakness demonstrates analytical thinking that examiners reward.</p>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n28">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The League of Nations was founded with noble ambitions &mdash; to prevent war, improve lives, and create a new international order based on cooperation. Yet it was crippled from the beginning by structural weaknesses and the absence of the world&rsquo;s most powerful nation.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The USA&rsquo;s absence was the League&rsquo;s greatest weakness:</strong> Without American economic and military power, the League lacked the ability to enforce its decisions &mdash; collective security was only as strong as its most powerful members, and the strongest refused to participate.</li>
          <li><strong>Structure guaranteed inaction:</strong> Unanimous voting, veto power, and no standing army meant the League could identify problems but rarely solve them &mdash; it was designed for consensus in a world that could not agree.</li>
          <li><strong>Ambition outstripped capability:</strong> The League tried to maintain peace, enforce treaties, achieve disarmament, and improve global welfare simultaneously, but lacked the authority, resources, or member commitment to accomplish any of these goals reliably.</li>
        </ul>
