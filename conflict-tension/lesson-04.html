        <p data-narration-id="n2">While the Treaty of Versailles dealt with Germany, separate treaties were needed for each of Germany&rsquo;s wartime allies. These settlements reshaped the map of Europe, dismantling empires and creating new nations &mdash; but they also sowed the seeds of future instability.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Turkey&rsquo;s Challenge</div>
          <p>The harsh terms of S&egrave;vres sparked a <strong>nationalist uprising</strong> led by <strong>Mustafa Kemal Atat&uuml;rk</strong>. Turkish forces fought to reclaim lost territory, forcing the Allies to negotiate a replacement treaty. The <strong>Treaty of Lausanne (1923)</strong> was significantly fairer: Turkey regained most of its land, faced <strong>no military restrictions</strong>, and paid <strong>no reparations</strong>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">Turkey remains the only example of a defeated nation successfully challenging and overturning its treaty terms by force. This demonstrated the fragility of the entire peace settlement &mdash; when challenged with determination, the Allies backed down.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n22">The peace settlement created several new nations, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. While this appeared to fulfil the principle of self-determination, the reality was far messier.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Critically evaluate the principle of self-determination. The Allies applied it selectively &mdash; millions of Germans were placed under Polish or Czech rule, and Austria was forbidden from uniting with Germany. Highlighting this hypocrisy demonstrates sophisticated analysis in your exam answers.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n26">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The wider peace settlement extended the flaws of Versailles across the defeated powers. Treaties left Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria weakened and resentful, new states were plagued by ethnic tensions and economic fragility, and Turkey&rsquo;s successful military challenge exposed the settlement&rsquo;s vulnerability to resistance.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Self-determination was applied inconsistently:</strong> The principle that peoples should choose their own government was selectively enforced &mdash; millions of Germans and Hungarians ended up as minorities in foreign states, and Anschluss was forbidden despite popular desire for union.</li>
          <li><strong>Turkey proved the settlement could be challenged:</strong> Atat&uuml;rk&rsquo;s nationalist uprising forced the Allies to replace S&egrave;vres with the far more lenient Lausanne treaty, demonstrating that the post-war order could be overturned by determined resistance.</li>
          <li><strong>New states inherited old problems:</strong> Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia were born with ethnic divisions, economic weakness, and political inexperience &mdash; creating potential flashpoints for future conflict rather than stable new democracies.</li>
        </ul>
