        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Growing Optimism in the Late 1920s</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The mid-to-late 1920s saw growing optimism about peace. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A 1924 plan that restructured Germany&rsquo;s reparations payments and provided US loans to stabilise the German economy. It ended the hyperinflation crisis but made Germany heavily dependent on American money.">Dawes Plan</dfn> (1924) had stabilised Germany&rsquo;s economy by providing US loans, ending the hyperinflation crisis. But it made Germany entirely dependent on American money &mdash; a weakness that would prove disastrous when the Depression hit. The biggest agreements of this period were made <strong>outside</strong> the League of Nations. The great powers trusted treaties between themselves more than they trusted the League&rsquo;s <dfn class="term" data-def="The principle that peace is maintained by countries acting together to prevent aggression. If one nation attacked another, all League members would respond collectively through moral condemnation, economic sanctions, or military action.">collective security</dfn>.</p>

        <!-- LOCARNO TREATIES -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">The Locarno Treaties (1925)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">The <dfn class="term" data-def="A series of agreements signed in October 1925 at Locarno, Switzerland. Germany, France, and Belgium voluntarily agreed to respect their shared borders, and the Rhineland would remain permanently demilitarised. Britain and Italy acted as guarantors. Seen as a major step towards reconciliation.">Locarno Treaties</dfn> were signed in October 1925 in Switzerland. For the first time since the war, Germany was <strong>voluntarily</strong> entering agreements rather than having terms forced on it.</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_1920s_agreements.png" alt="Comparison of three 1920s peace agreements — Locarno Treaties (1925), Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928), and the Disarmament Conference (1932) — showing how all major diplomacy happened outside the League of Nations and lacked enforcement.">
        </figure>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">The treaties created the &ldquo;Spirit of Locarno&rdquo; &mdash; a period of real warmth between former enemies. As a direct result, <strong>Germany joined the League of Nations in 1926</strong>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">But these agreements were made <strong>outside the League</strong>. This showed that the great powers trusted direct deals more than collective security. Germany&rsquo;s refusal to guarantee its eastern borders hinted at future ambitions that would eventually shatter the peace.</p>

        <!-- KELLOGG-BRIAND PACT -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n8">The Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">The <dfn class="term" data-def="An international agreement signed in August 1928 in which 62 nations, including Germany, France, and the USA, promised not to use war as a means of settling international disputes. It had no enforcement mechanism and did not cover wars of self-defence, making it essentially unenforceable.">Kellogg-Briand Pact</dfn> was signed in August 1928 &mdash; the peak of 1920s optimism. It was co-authored by US Secretary of State Frank Kellogg and French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n10">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Kellogg-Briand Pact</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Signed by <strong>62 nations</strong>, including Germany, France, and &mdash; importantly &mdash; the <strong>USA</strong>.</li>
            <li>All signatories promised <strong>not to use war</strong> to settle disputes.</li>
            <li><strong>Fatal flaw:</strong> there was <strong>no enforcement mechanism</strong>. If a country broke the pact, nothing would happen.</li>
            <li>It did not cover wars of <strong>self-defence</strong> &mdash; a loophole so big that any aggressor could claim they were defending themselves.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">The <strong>USA</strong> &mdash; not even a League member &mdash; signed this pact. The most important diplomacy was happening <strong>outside Geneva</strong>, not within the League. If even peace agreements bypassed the League, what purpose did it serve?</p>

        <!-- DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n12">The Disarmament Conference (1932&ndash;1934)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">One of the League&rsquo;s main aims was <dfn class="term" data-def="The reduction of a country&rsquo;s military forces and weapons. The League aimed to get all nations to reduce their armies, but in practice only Germany had been forced to disarm under the Treaty of Versailles.">disarmament</dfn>. Germany had been forced to disarm by the Treaty of Versailles. Other countries were supposed to follow &mdash; but none did. Britain wanted to cut spending but still had a huge empire to protect. France refused to reduce its weapons because it feared Germany.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">In 1932, the League organised a <strong>World Disarmament Conference</strong> in Geneva. It was meant to be the next big step towards peace. Instead, it became a disaster.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n15">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Disarmament Conference</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Hitler pointed out that Germany was the <strong>only country</strong> that had actually disarmed &mdash; everyone else had broken their promise.</li>
            <li>He demanded France <strong>reduce its army to Germany&rsquo;s size</strong>. France refused.</li>
            <li>Germany <strong>walked out</strong> of the conference &mdash; and then <strong>left the League of Nations</strong> (October 1933).</li>
            <li>Behind the scenes, <strong>Hitler was secretly rearming Germany</strong> the whole time.</li>
            <li>The conference collapsed with <strong>no agreement</strong>. France began to rearm and build border defences.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n16">The failure of the Disarmament Conference was a turning point. The League had failed in one of its core missions. Countries now began rearming instead of disarming, and the optimism of the 1920s was well and truly over.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Locarno and Kellogg-Briand <em>look</em> like successes. A strong answer will argue they were actually <strong>signs of the League&rsquo;s weakness</strong> &mdash; the key diplomacy happened outside the League, proving powerful nations did not trust collective security. Link this to the Disarmament Conference failure to show how optimism collapsed.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1920s agreements looked hopeful, but they all bypassed the League and lacked enforcement. When the Disarmament Conference collapsed and Germany walked out, the era of optimism was over.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Diplomacy bypassed the League:</strong> Locarno and Kellogg-Briand were negotiated outside the League, proving powerful nations did not trust collective security.</li>
          <li><strong>Germany&rsquo;s eastern borders were left unguaranteed:</strong> Locarno secured western borders, but Germany refused to guarantee its borders with Poland and Czechoslovakia &mdash; a warning sign for the late 1930s.</li>
          <li><strong>The Disarmament Conference failed:</strong> The League could not deliver on one of its core aims. Hitler used the conference to claim victimhood, then left both the conference and the League while secretly rearming.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the agreements related to each other and their cumulative impact.\nExample: The Dawes Plan (1924) stabilised Germany\u2019s economy through US loans, ending the hyperinflation crisis and creating the conditions for reconciliation. This led directly to the Locarno Treaties (1925), where Germany voluntarily agreed to respect its western borders with France and Belgium for the first time since the war. The resulting \u2018Spirit of Locarno\u2019 brought Germany into the League in 1926. The optimism peaked with the Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928), signed by 62 nations including the USA. However, all these agreements bypassed the League and lacked enforcement, meaning the appearance of peace was fragile and dependent on continued goodwill.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: The Locarno Treaties (1925) were significant because Germany voluntarily agreed to respect its western borders with France and Belgium, with Britain and Italy acting as guarantors. This created the \u2018Spirit of Locarno\u2019 and led to Germany joining the League of Nations in 1926. However, Germany refused to guarantee its eastern borders with Poland and Czechoslovakia, which hinted at future ambitions.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: The Kellogg-Briand Pact was signed in 1928 by 62 nations including the USA. All signatories promised not to use war to settle disputes. But the pact had no enforcement mechanism and a self-defence loophole, so it could not actually prevent aggression.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: Countries signed agreements to keep peace in the 1920s. / The Locarno Treaties were signed in 1925.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the failure had escalating consequences.\nExample: The Disarmament Conference exposed the contradiction at the heart of the League \u2014 Germany had been forced to disarm under Versailles, but other countries had broken their promise to follow. Hitler exploited this by demanding France reduce its army to Germany\u2019s size. When France refused, Hitler had a propaganda victory: he could claim Germany was being treated unfairly. Germany walked out of the conference and left the League in October 1933, then secretly began rearming. The failure encouraged France to begin rearming and building border defences, ending the era of disarmament and replacing it with an arms race.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: The Disarmament Conference failed because of disagreements between France and Germany. Hitler pointed out that Germany was the only country that had actually disarmed, as required by Versailles. He demanded equality, but France refused to reduce its army because it feared Germany. Germany then walked out of the conference and left the League of Nations in October 1933.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: The League organised a Disarmament Conference in 1932, but it collapsed with no agreement. Germany left the conference and then left the League of Nations. Hitler began secretly rearming Germany.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: The Disarmament Conference failed because countries could not agree. / Hitler took Germany out of the League of Nations.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

This goodwill led to Germany joining the League in 1926 and the Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928), where 62 nations \u2014 including the USA \u2014 renounced war. But these agreements masked structural weaknesses: Germany refused to guarantee its eastern borders, the Kellogg-Briand Pact had no enforcement, and the key diplomacy bypassed the League entirely.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: The League\u2019s organisation created serious weaknesses. The Assembly met only once a year, decisions required a unanimous vote in the Council, and the League had no permanent army \u2014 it relied entirely on members providing troops. This made it painfully slow: the Lytton Commission took over a year to investigate Manchuria. Unanimous voting meant one country could block any action. The lack of an army meant enforcement depended on the willingness of members. However, the real problem was that major agreements bypassed the League entirely \u2014 the Locarno Treaties (1925) and the Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928) were negotiated outside Geneva, proving the great powers never trusted the League\u2019s collective security system. The Disarmament Conference (1932\u20131934) then failed when Germany demanded equal treatment, France refused, and Hitler walked out. These failures showed that the League\u2019s structural weaknesses were compounded by the self-interest of its leading members, who refused to make the system work.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The League\u2019s organisation was flawed from the start. The Assembly met only once a year, and the Council required unanimous votes, meaning one country could veto any decision. The League had no army and relied on members providing troops, but no one wanted to send soldiers to fight in distant disputes. The Lytton Commission took over a year to report on Manchuria because the League had no rapid-response capability.\nExample (other factor): The self-interest of Britain and France was equally important. They dominated the League but prioritised their own empires and trade. At Corfu (1923), the Conference of Ambassadors sided with Italy. Over Abyssinia, sanctions deliberately excluded oil, coal, and steel. The Hoare-Laval Pact (1935) tried to reward Mussolini with two-thirds of Abyssinia. The League\u2019s structure might have worked if its members had been committed to it.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The absence of the USA also weakened the League. America was the world\u2019s strongest economic power, so sanctions were incomplete without it. The Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928) was signed by 62 nations including the USA \u2014 but outside the League, showing even peace agreements bypassed it.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The League was too slow because it only met once a year. / The League had no army to force countries to obey.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: Britain and France controlled the League but repeatedly put their own interests first. They negotiated the Locarno Treaties (1925) and signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928) outside the League, showing they did not trust collective security. France refused to disarm at the Disarmament Conference because it feared Germany, giving Hitler the excuse to walk out and leave the League (October 1933). Over Manchuria, Britain wanted to maintain good trading relations with Japan. Over Abyssinia, they kept the Suez Canal open, excluded oil from sanctions, and the Hoare-Laval Pact tried to give Mussolini two-thirds of Abyssinia. However, the League\u2019s structural weaknesses also contributed. The absence of the USA \u2014 the world\u2019s strongest economic power \u2014 meant sanctions were always incomplete. The League had no army and relied on members providing troops. The Great Depression made all nations turn inward, refusing to risk their own fragile economies. Self-interest was the main cause, but structural flaws made it impossible to overcome.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Britain and France prioritised their empires and trade over the League\u2019s principles. Key diplomacy bypassed the League \u2014 the Locarno Treaties and Kellogg-Briand Pact were negotiated outside Geneva. France refused to disarm because it feared Germany, making the Disarmament Conference collapse. Over Abyssinia, Britain refused to close the Suez Canal and both countries drew up the Hoare-Laval Pact to reward Mussolini.\nExample (other factor): The League\u2019s organisation was also flawed. The Assembly met only once a year, unanimous voting was required, and there was no permanent army. The Lytton Commission took over a year to report on Manchuria. These structural problems meant the League could not respond quickly or forcefully to crises, regardless of its members\u2019 intentions.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The Great Depression was also a reason the League failed. After the Wall Street Crash (1929), countries turned to protectionism and refused to impose sanctions. Britain and France slashed military spending. The Depression drove Japan to invade Manchuria for resources and fuelled extremism in Germany.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Britain and France did not want to risk their own trade to help the League. / The League had no army to enforce its decisions.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: The Great Depression destroyed the cooperation that had existed in the 1920s. After the Wall Street Crash (1929), countries turned to protectionism, raising tariffs to protect their own industries. Nations refused to impose economic sanctions on aggressors because they feared hurting their own fragile economies. Britain and France slashed military spending, leaving them unable to back up the League with force. The Depression fuelled extremism \u2014 Japan\u2019s military invaded Manchuria for resources, and Hitler exploited mass unemployment to rise to power. The Disarmament Conference collapsed when Hitler demanded equal treatment and France refused. However, the League had shown weaknesses before the Depression. The Locarno Treaties and Kellogg-Briand Pact bypassed the League entirely, proving the great powers never trusted collective security. The League\u2019s structure \u2014 no army, unanimous voting, slow decision-making \u2014 was flawed from the start. The Depression exposed and deepened existing weaknesses rather than creating them.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The Depression crippled the League because countries turned inward. Over 6 million were unemployed in Germany by 1932. Nations refused to impose sanctions on aggressors because they feared damaging their own economies. Britain and France cut military spending, so the League had no credible threat of force. The Depression drove Japan to invade Manchuria for resources and helped Hitler rise to power in Germany.\nExample (other factor): The League\u2019s structural weaknesses also mattered. It had no army and relied on members providing troops. The Assembly met only once a year and the Council required unanimous votes. These problems pre-dated the Depression \u2014 the Locarno Treaties and Kellogg-Briand Pact were negotiated outside the League in the 1920s, showing the great powers never trusted it. The Disarmament Conference failed partly because France refused to reduce its army, not just because of the Depression.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The absence of the USA weakened the League regardless of the Depression. America was the world\u2019s strongest economic power and not a League member. Over Manchuria, Japan\u2019s main trade was with the USA, so League sanctions were meaningless. Without American military power, the League could not challenge aggressors.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The Depression made countries too poor to help the League. / Countries were too busy with their own problems to stop aggressors.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms.
