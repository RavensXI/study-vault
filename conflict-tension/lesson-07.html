        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Growing Optimism in the Late 1920s</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The mid-to-late 1920s saw growing optimism about peace. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A 1924 plan that restructured Germany&rsquo;s reparations payments and provided US loans to stabilise the German economy. It ended the hyperinflation crisis but made Germany heavily dependent on American money.">Dawes Plan</dfn> (1924) had stabilised Germany&rsquo;s economy by providing US loans, ending the hyperinflation crisis. But it made Germany entirely dependent on American money &mdash; a weakness that would prove disastrous when the Depression hit. The biggest agreements of this period were made <strong>outside</strong> the League of Nations. The great powers trusted treaties between themselves more than they trusted the League&rsquo;s <dfn class="term" data-def="The principle that peace is maintained by countries acting together to prevent aggression. If one nation attacked another, all League members would respond collectively through moral condemnation, economic sanctions, or military action.">collective security</dfn>.</p>

        <!-- LOCARNO TREATIES -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">The Locarno Treaties (1925)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">The <dfn class="term" data-def="A series of agreements signed in October 1925 at Locarno, Switzerland. Germany, France, and Belgium voluntarily agreed to respect their shared borders, and the Rhineland would remain permanently demilitarised. Britain and Italy acted as guarantors. Seen as a major step towards reconciliation.">Locarno Treaties</dfn> were signed in October 1925 in Switzerland. For the first time since the war, Germany was <strong>voluntarily</strong> entering agreements rather than having terms forced on it.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n5">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Locarno Treaties</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Germany, France, and Belgium <strong>voluntarily promised</strong> to respect their shared western borders.</li>
            <li>The <dfn class="term" data-def="A strip of German territory along the River Rhine bordering France. Under the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was forbidden from placing troops or military equipment in this zone. It was intended as a buffer to protect France from German attack.">demilitarised zone</dfn> in the Rhineland was to remain <strong>permanently</strong> demilitarised.</li>
            <li><strong>Britain and Italy</strong> acted as guarantors &mdash; promising to act if any signatory broke the deal.</li>
            <li>Crucially, Germany did <strong>NOT</strong> agree to respect its <strong>eastern borders</strong> with Poland and Czechoslovakia &mdash; a major warning sign.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">The treaties created the &ldquo;Spirit of Locarno&rdquo; &mdash; a period of real warmth between former enemies. As a direct result, <strong>Germany joined the League of Nations in 1926</strong>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">But these agreements were made <strong>outside the League</strong>. This showed that the great powers trusted direct deals more than collective security. Germany&rsquo;s refusal to guarantee its eastern borders hinted at future ambitions that would eventually shatter the peace.</p>

        <!-- KELLOGG-BRIAND PACT -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n8">The Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">The <dfn class="term" data-def="An international agreement signed in August 1928 in which 62 nations, including Germany, France, and the USA, promised not to use war as a means of settling international disputes. It had no enforcement mechanism and did not cover wars of self-defence, making it essentially unenforceable.">Kellogg-Briand Pact</dfn> was signed in August 1928 &mdash; the peak of 1920s optimism. It was co-authored by US Secretary of State Frank Kellogg and French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n10">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Kellogg-Briand Pact</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Signed by <strong>62 nations</strong>, including Germany, France, and &mdash; importantly &mdash; the <strong>USA</strong>.</li>
            <li>All signatories promised <strong>not to use war</strong> to settle disputes.</li>
            <li><strong>Fatal flaw:</strong> there was <strong>no enforcement mechanism</strong>. If a country broke the pact, nothing would happen.</li>
            <li>It did not cover wars of <strong>self-defence</strong> &mdash; a loophole so big that any aggressor could claim they were defending themselves.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">The <strong>USA</strong> &mdash; not even a League member &mdash; signed this pact. The most important diplomacy was happening <strong>outside Geneva</strong>, not within the League. If even peace agreements bypassed the League, what purpose did it serve?</p>

        <!-- DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n12">The Disarmament Conference (1932&ndash;1934)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">One of the League&rsquo;s main aims was <dfn class="term" data-def="The reduction of a country&rsquo;s military forces and weapons. The League aimed to get all nations to reduce their armies, but in practice only Germany had been forced to disarm under the Treaty of Versailles.">disarmament</dfn>. Germany had been forced to disarm by the Treaty of Versailles. Other countries were supposed to follow &mdash; but none did. Britain wanted to cut spending but still had a huge empire to protect. France refused to reduce its weapons because it feared Germany.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">In 1932, the League organised a <strong>World Disarmament Conference</strong> in Geneva. It was meant to be the next big step towards peace. Instead, it became a disaster.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n15">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Disarmament Conference</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Hitler pointed out that Germany was the <strong>only country</strong> that had actually disarmed &mdash; everyone else had broken their promise.</li>
            <li>He demanded France <strong>reduce its army to Germany&rsquo;s size</strong>. France refused.</li>
            <li>Germany <strong>walked out</strong> of the conference &mdash; and then <strong>left the League of Nations</strong> (October 1933).</li>
            <li>Behind the scenes, <strong>Hitler was secretly rearming Germany</strong> the whole time.</li>
            <li>The conference collapsed with <strong>no agreement</strong>. France began to rearm and build border defences.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n16">The failure of the Disarmament Conference was a turning point. The League had failed in one of its core missions. Countries now began rearming instead of disarming, and the optimism of the 1920s was well and truly over.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Locarno and Kellogg-Briand <em>look</em> like successes. A strong answer will argue they were actually <strong>signs of the League&rsquo;s weakness</strong> &mdash; the key diplomacy happened outside the League, proving powerful nations did not trust collective security. Link this to the Disarmament Conference failure to show how optimism collapsed.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n20">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1920s agreements looked hopeful, but they all bypassed the League and lacked enforcement. When the Disarmament Conference collapsed and Germany walked out, the era of optimism was over.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Diplomacy bypassed the League:</strong> Locarno and Kellogg-Briand were negotiated outside the League, proving powerful nations did not trust collective security.</li>
          <li><strong>Germany&rsquo;s eastern borders were left unguaranteed:</strong> Locarno secured western borders, but Germany refused to guarantee its borders with Poland and Czechoslovakia &mdash; a warning sign for the late 1930s.</li>
          <li><strong>The Disarmament Conference failed:</strong> The League could not deliver on one of its core aims. Hitler used the conference to claim victimhood, then left both the conference and the League while secretly rearming.</li>
        </ul>
