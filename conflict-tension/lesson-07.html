        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Growing Optimism in the Late 1920s</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The mid-to-late 1920s saw growing optimism about international peace. Remarkably, the most significant agreements of this period were made <strong>outside</strong> the League of Nations framework. While this seemed like good news at the time, it carried a troubling implication: the great powers trusted specific treaties negotiated between themselves more than they trusted the League&rsquo;s system of <dfn class="term" data-def="The principle that peace is maintained by countries acting together to prevent aggression. If one nation attacked another, all League members would respond collectively through moral condemnation, economic sanctions, or military action.">collective security</dfn>.</p>

        <!-- LOCARNO TREATIES -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">The Locarno Treaties (1925)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">The <dfn class="term" data-def="A series of agreements signed in October 1925 at Locarno, Switzerland. Germany, France, and Belgium voluntarily agreed to respect their shared borders, and the Rhineland would remain permanently demilitarised. Britain and Italy acted as guarantors. Seen as a major step towards reconciliation.">Locarno Treaties</dfn> were signed in October 1925 at Locarno, Switzerland. They represented a dramatic shift in European diplomacy &mdash; for the first time since the war, Germany was voluntarily entering into agreements rather than having terms imposed upon it.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n5">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Locarno Treaties</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Germany, France, and Belgium <strong>voluntarily promised</strong> to respect their shared western borders.</li>
            <li>The <dfn class="term" data-def="A strip of German territory along the River Rhine bordering France. Under the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was forbidden from placing troops or military equipment in this zone. It was intended as a buffer to protect France from German attack.">demilitarised zone</dfn> in the Rhineland was to remain <strong>permanently</strong> demilitarised.</li>
            <li><strong>Britain and Italy</strong> acted as guarantors &mdash; promising to take action if any signatory broke the agreement.</li>
            <li>Crucially, Germany did <strong>NOT</strong> agree to respect its <strong>eastern borders</strong> with Poland and Czechoslovakia &mdash; a significant and ominous omission.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">The treaties produced what became known as the &ldquo;Spirit of Locarno&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Locarno Honeymoon&rdquo; &mdash; a period of genuine warmth and cooperation between former enemies. As a direct result, <strong>Germany was invited to join the League of Nations in 1926</strong>, seemingly completing its return to the international community.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">However, there was an important subtext. The fact that these agreements were made <strong>outside the League</strong> showed that the great powers trusted specific, negotiated treaties between themselves far more than they trusted the League&rsquo;s collective security system. Furthermore, Germany&rsquo;s refusal to guarantee its eastern borders hinted at future ambitions that would eventually shatter the peace.</p>

        <!-- KELLOGG-BRIAND PACT -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n8">The Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">The <dfn class="term" data-def="An international agreement signed in August 1928 in which 62 nations, including Germany, France, and the USA, promised not to use war as a means of settling international disputes. It had no enforcement mechanism and did not cover wars of self-defence, making it essentially unenforceable.">Kellogg-Briand Pact</dfn> was signed in August 1928 and represented the high-water mark of 1920s optimism. It was co-authored by US Secretary of State Frank Kellogg and French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n10">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Kellogg-Briand Pact</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Signed by <strong>62 nations</strong>, including Germany, France, and &mdash; significantly &mdash; the <strong>USA</strong>.</li>
            <li>All signatories promised <strong>not to use war</strong> as a means of settling international disputes.</li>
            <li><strong>Fatal flaw:</strong> there was absolutely <strong>no enforcement mechanism</strong>. If a country broke the pact, nothing would happen.</li>
            <li>It did not cover wars of <strong>self-defence</strong> &mdash; a loophole so large that any aggressor could simply claim they were defending themselves.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">The involvement of the <strong>USA</strong> &mdash; which was not even a member of the League of Nations &mdash; was both significant and revealing. It showed that the most important diplomacy of the era was happening <strong>outside Geneva</strong>, not within the League&rsquo;s framework. If even peace agreements bypassed the League, what purpose did it truly serve?</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Be prepared to explain the <strong>contradictory nature</strong> of these agreements. On the surface, Locarno and Kellogg-Briand look like peace successes. But a strong answer will argue they were actually <strong>signs of the League&rsquo;s weakness</strong> &mdash; the most important diplomacy was happening outside the League, proving that powerful nations did not trust collective security to keep the peace.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n15">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Locarno Treaties and the Kellogg-Briand Pact represented the high point of 1920s international cooperation. Yet their very existence outside the League of Nations framework highlighted a crucial, underlying problem that would prove fatal.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Diplomacy bypassed the League:</strong> The most significant peace agreements of the 1920s &mdash; Locarno and Kellogg-Briand &mdash; were negotiated outside the League, demonstrating that powerful nations trusted direct treaties between themselves more than the League&rsquo;s collective security system.</li>
          <li><strong>Germany&rsquo;s eastern borders were left unguaranteed:</strong> While Locarno secured the western borders, Germany deliberately refused to guarantee its borders with Poland and Czechoslovakia &mdash; a warning sign that would become catastrophically relevant in the late 1930s.</li>
          <li><strong>Promises without enforcement are meaningless:</strong> The Kellogg-Briand Pact was signed by 62 nations but had no enforcement mechanism and a self-defence loophole wide enough to drive an army through. Within a decade, signatories including Germany, Italy, and Japan would all launch wars of aggression.</li>
        </ul>
