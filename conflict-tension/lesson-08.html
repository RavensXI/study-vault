        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The Great Depression</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The <dfn class="term" data-def="The catastrophic collapse of the US stock market in October 1929 that triggered a worldwide economic depression. Share prices plummeted, banks collapsed, businesses failed, and millions lost their jobs and savings.">Wall Street Crash</dfn> of October 1929 triggered the worst economic crisis the modern world had ever seen. Its effects rippled outward from the United States and devastated economies across the globe, destroying the fragile optimism of the &ldquo;Locarno era&rdquo; almost overnight.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Global Impact of the Depression</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>International trade collapsed</strong> as countries introduced <dfn class="term" data-def="The policy of protecting a country&rsquo;s own industries by taxing or restricting imports from other countries. During the Depression, nations raised tariffs to shield their economies, which further reduced global trade and deepened the crisis.">protectionism</dfn> &mdash; imposing tariffs and trade barriers to protect their own industries.</li>
            <li><strong>Mass unemployment</strong> hit every major economy. In Germany, unemployment reached over 6 million by 1932.</li>
            <li><strong>Rise of extremism:</strong> Economic desperation fuelled the rise of the <strong>Nazis in Germany</strong> and empowered the <strong>Japanese military</strong>, who demanded territorial expansion.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">The Depression had a devastating impact on the League of Nations. International cooperation &mdash; the League&rsquo;s lifeblood &mdash; evaporated as countries turned inward. Nations became <strong>reluctant to impose economic sanctions</strong> on aggressors because they feared damaging their own fragile economies. Britain and France, the League&rsquo;s most important members, cut military spending drastically, leaving them unable and unwilling to back up the League&rsquo;s decisions with force.</p>

        <!-- MANCHURIAN CRISIS -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n5">The Manchurian Crisis (1931&ndash;1933)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">The Manchurian Crisis was the first major test of the League by one of its own leading members. It would prove to be a catastrophic failure that fatally undermined the League&rsquo;s credibility.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">Background: Japan and the Depression</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">Japan&rsquo;s economy was devastated by the Depression. As an island nation dependent on trade, the collapse of international markets and the rise of protectionism hit Japan particularly hard. The Japanese military, which had enormous political influence, argued that territorial expansion in Asia was the solution &mdash; and their eyes turned to <dfn class="term" data-def="A region in north-eastern China, rich in natural resources including coal, iron, and fertile agricultural land. Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931 and turned it into a puppet state called Manchukuo.">Manchuria</dfn>, a resource-rich region of north-eastern China.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">The Mukden Incident (September 1931)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">In September 1931, the Japanese army <strong>staged an explosion</strong> on the South Manchuria Railway near the city of Mukden. They blamed Chinese saboteurs and used this fabricated incident as a pretext for launching a <strong>full-scale invasion</strong> of Manchuria. By early 1932, Japan had conquered the entire region.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n11">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Japan renamed the conquered territory &ldquo;Manchukuo&rdquo; and installed a <dfn class="term" data-def="A state that is officially independent but in reality is controlled by an outside power. Japan set up Manchukuo as a puppet state, placing the former Chinese emperor Pu Yi on the throne while Japanese officials made all real decisions.">puppet state</dfn> &mdash; placing the last Chinese emperor, <strong>Pu Yi</strong>, on the throne as a figurehead while Japanese officials controlled everything behind the scenes.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n12">The League&rsquo;s Response</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">China appealed to the League for help. The League&rsquo;s response was painfully slow and ultimately ineffective:</p>

It took over a year to report and concluded that Japan had acted unlawfully, but the League took no meaningful action to reverse the invasion.">Lytton Commission</dfn> to investigate &mdash; but the commission took <strong>over a year</strong> to produce its report, during which time Japan continued to consolidate its hold on Manchuria.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n15">The Lytton Report, published in October 1932, concluded that <strong>Japan had acted unlawfully</strong>. In February 1933, the League Assembly voted <strong>42 to 1</strong> to accept the report &mdash; Japan cast the only dissenting vote.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n16">Japan&rsquo;s response was devastating: it simply <strong>walked out of the League</strong> and formally withdrew in March 1933. The League imposed <strong>no economic sanctions</strong> and took <strong>no military action</strong>. Manchuria was too far away, and Britain and France &mdash; dealing with their own economic crises &mdash; were completely unwilling to risk a war in the Far East.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>The Manchurian Crisis is a topic that could be asked about specifically in the exam. It is also an excellent example to use in <strong>any question about the League&rsquo;s failure</strong> &mdash; it demonstrates every weakness (slow response, no sanctions, no military action, powerful members acting with impunity). Learn the key dates and the sequence of events thoroughly.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n20">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Manchurian Crisis proved that a powerful League member could commit blatant aggression and face no real consequences. It sent a clear message to Mussolini and Hitler: the League was a &ldquo;paper tiger&rdquo; &mdash; impressive on paper but powerless in practice.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Depression destroyed international cooperation:</strong> The economic crisis made nations turn inward, unwilling to impose sanctions or risk military confrontation. The League&rsquo;s entire system of collective security depended on cooperation that no longer existed.</li>
          <li><strong>The League was fatally slow:</strong> The Lytton Commission took over a year to report, during which Japan consolidated its conquest. By the time the League voted, Manchuria was already lost &mdash; proving the League could not respond to fast-moving crises.</li>
          <li><strong>A green light for future aggressors:</strong> Japan&rsquo;s success in defying the League without consequence emboldened Mussolini (who would invade Abyssinia in 1935) and Hitler (who would begin remilitarising Germany). The 1930s pattern of unchecked aggression began here.</li>
        </ul>
