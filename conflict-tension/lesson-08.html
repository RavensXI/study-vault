        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The Great Depression</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The <dfn class="term" data-def="The catastrophic collapse of the US stock market in October 1929 that triggered a worldwide economic depression. Share prices plummeted, banks collapsed, businesses failed, and millions lost their jobs and savings.">Wall Street Crash</dfn> of October 1929 triggered the worst economic crisis the world had seen. Its effects spread from the USA and wrecked economies everywhere, destroying the optimism of the 1920s almost overnight.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Global Impact of the Depression</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Trade collapsed</strong> as countries turned to <dfn class="term" data-def="The policy of protecting a country&rsquo;s own industries by taxing or restricting imports from other countries. During the Depression, nations raised tariffs to shield their economies, which further reduced global trade and deepened the crisis.">protectionism</dfn> &mdash; putting up tariffs to protect their own industries. America stopped trading with much of the world, so the Depression spread.</li>
            <li><strong>Mass unemployment</strong> hit every major economy. In Germany, over 6 million were unemployed by 1932.</li>
            <li><strong>Rise of extremism:</strong> Desperate people supported leaders like <strong>Hitler</strong> and the <strong>Japanese military</strong>, who promised simple solutions &mdash; restore national pride and take over more land.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">The Depression crippled the League. Countries turned inward. They were <strong>too busy dealing with their own problems</strong> &mdash; unemployment, poverty &mdash; to support the League. Nations refused to impose <strong>economic sanctions</strong> on aggressors because they feared hurting their own fragile economies. Britain and France slashed military spending, leaving them unable to back up the League with force.</p>

        <!-- MANCHURIAN CRISIS -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n5">The Manchurian Crisis (1931&ndash;1933)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">This was the League&rsquo;s first big crisis involving a major member. It ended in total failure and fatally damaged the League&rsquo;s reputation.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">Background: Japan and the Depression</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">Japan was an island nation dependent on trade, so the Depression hit it hard. The powerful Japanese military argued that the answer was territorial expansion &mdash; seizing resource-rich land in Asia. Their target was <dfn class="term" data-def="A region in north-eastern China, rich in natural resources including coal, iron, and fertile agricultural land. Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931 and turned it into a puppet state called Manchukuo.">Manchuria</dfn>, a region of north-eastern China rich in coal, iron, and farmland. China itself was unstable and divided, making it an easier target.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">The Mukden Incident (September 1931)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">In September 1931, the Japanese army <strong>staged an explosion</strong> on the South Manchuria Railway near Mukden. They blamed Chinese saboteurs and used this fake incident as an excuse for a <strong>full-scale invasion</strong>. By early 1932, Japan controlled the whole of Manchuria. In February 1932, Japan also <strong>bombed the Chinese city of Shanghai</strong>.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Japan renamed the territory &ldquo;Manchukuo&rdquo; and set up a <dfn class="term" data-def="A state that is officially independent but in reality is controlled by an outside power. Japan set up Manchukuo as a puppet state, placing the former Chinese emperor Pu Yi on the throne while Japanese officials made all real decisions.">puppet state</dfn> &mdash; placing the former Chinese emperor <strong>Pu Yi</strong> on the throne as a figurehead.

        <p data-narration-id="n13">China appealed to the League. The response was painfully slow and completely useless:</p>

It <strong>walked out of the League</strong> (March 1933) and then <strong>invaded Jehol</strong>, another region of China. The League imposed <strong>no sanctions and no military action</strong>. Without the USA and USSR, economic sanctions would have been meaningless anyway &mdash; Japan&rsquo;s main trade was with America. Only the USA or USSR had the resources to actually stop Japan, and neither was in the League.</p>

            <li><strong>No sanctions:</strong> Without the USA and USSR, economic sanctions would have been pointless. Japan mainly traded with America.</li>
            <li><strong>Too far away:</strong> Britain and France would not risk sending their navies halfway around the world.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-interest:</strong> Britain wanted to stay on good terms with Japan. Member countries could not agree on what to do.</li>
            <li><strong>Structural weakness:</strong> The League had no army. If the USSR had been a member, it could have helped &mdash; but it was not.</li>

        <p>For &ldquo;Write an account&rdquo; questions on Manchuria, show how the crisis <strong>got worse step by step</strong>: Japan staged the Mukden Incident, the League was too slow (Lytton), Japan ignored the ruling, walked out, and invaded Jehol. Explain <em>why</em> it was a crisis &mdash; a permanent Council member broke the Covenant, and the League could do nothing. Link to wider consequences: it set a <strong>precedent</strong> that encouraged Mussolini and Hitler.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Manchurian Crisis proved a powerful League member could commit open aggression and face no real consequences. It set a <strong>precedent</strong> &mdash; the League could be ignored. Mussolini and Hitler watched closely.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Depression killed cooperation:</strong> Countries turned inward and refused to impose sanctions or risk war. Without the USA and USSR, the League had no real power to act.</li>
          <li><strong>The League was too slow:</strong> The Lytton Commission took over a year. By the time the League voted, Manchuria was lost. Japan then invaded Jehol too, proving the League could not respond to fast-moving crises.</li>
          <li><strong>A green light for aggressors:</strong> Japan defied the League and got away with it. This encouraged Mussolini (Abyssinia, 1935) and Hitler (Rhineland, 1936). The pattern of unchecked aggression began here.</li>
