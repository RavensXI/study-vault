        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The Treaty of Versailles</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">In <strong>June 1919</strong>, Germany was invited to the Palace of Versailles outside Paris. Its representatives were told to sign the <dfn class="term" data-def="The peace treaty signed on 28 June 1919 at the Palace of Versailles that officially ended World War One between Germany and the Allied Powers. It imposed severe military, territorial, and economic penalties on Germany.">Treaty of Versailles</dfn> or face invasion. They had no choice. Germany had been excluded from all negotiations &mdash; the terms were decided by the Big Three and handed over as a <dfn class="term" data-def="A German term meaning 'dictated peace.' Germans used this word to describe the Treaty of Versailles because they had no say in the negotiations and were forced to accept the terms under threat of invasion.">Diktat</dfn>, a dictated peace with no discussion allowed.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Treaty Categories</div>
          <p>The Treaty punished Germany across four main areas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Military Terms</strong> &mdash; severe restrictions on armed forces</li>
            <li><strong>Territorial Terms</strong> &mdash; loss of land in Europe and overseas</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Terms</strong> &mdash; <dfn class="term" data-def="Financial compensation demanded from Germany by the Allied Powers for the damage caused during World War One. The final sum was set at &pound;6.6 billion in 1921.">reparations</dfn> and resource extraction</li>

        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Military Terms</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">The Treaty stripped Germany&rsquo;s military power. For a country where the army was a source of huge national pride and respect, these terms were deeply humiliating.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n9">Territorial Terms</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">Germany lost <strong>10% of its land</strong> and <strong>12% of its population</strong>, along with all overseas colonies. These losses stripped the country of key industrial regions, farmland, and millions of German-speaking citizens.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n17">Economic Terms</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">The economic penalties aimed to weaken Germany and compensate the Allies for war damage. Combined with the loss of land, they crippled Germany&rsquo;s ability to recover.</p>

France would receive <strong>50%</strong> (they had wanted 70%), Britain <strong>30%</strong>, and the rest shared among smaller allies.

        <h2 data-narration-id="n22">Article 231: The War Guilt Clause</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">The most hated part of the Treaty was <strong>Article 231</strong> &mdash; the <dfn class="term" data-def="Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles, which forced Germany to accept sole responsibility for causing World War One. It was used to justify the reparations and other punishments imposed on Germany.">War Guilt Clause</dfn>. It forced Germany to accept <strong>total blame</strong> for starting the war.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n24">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Article 231</div>
          <p>The War Guilt Clause had a key legal purpose: by saying Germany alone started the war, the Allies could justify every other punishment &mdash; reparations, disarmament, and land losses. Without Article 231, they had no formal basis for such severe terms.</p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n25">Germans were furious. Many did not believe they were solely to blame &mdash; Austria-Hungary had declared war on Serbia, and Russia had been the first to mobilise troops. German propaganda had told the public they were fighting a defensive war. The clause felt like a lie imposed by the victors, and it fuelled lasting resentment that nationalist politicians would exploit for years.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n26">How the Terms Connected</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n27">The Treaty&rsquo;s punishments were not separate &mdash; they reinforced each other, making Germany&rsquo;s situation far worse than any single term alone.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n28">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Interconnected Terms</div>
          <p>Losing industrial regions like the <strong>Saar</strong> and <strong>Upper Silesia</strong> (26% of coal, half of iron and steel) directly made it harder to pay &pound;6.6 billion in reparations. Being forced to deliver coal to France, Belgium, and Italy on top of this created an impossible situation. Military restrictions meant Germany could not resist by force. The Treaty was a compromise &mdash; none of the Big Three got everything they wanted &mdash; but for Germany, it was crushing.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Treaty dismantled German power through military, territorial, and economic penalties, all justified by Article 231. Germany was excluded from negotiations and forced to sign under threat of invasion, creating deep resentment that shaped European politics for decades.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Germany was attacked on every front:</strong> 100,000-man army, 10% of land lost, &pound;6.6 billion in reparations, and forced to accept sole war guilt &mdash; the penalties left Germany weakened, humiliated, and angry.</li>
          <li><strong>Article 231 was the foundation:</strong> The War Guilt Clause legally justified every other punishment. Without it, the Allies had no formal basis for reparations or disarmament.</li>
          <li><strong>The terms reinforced each other:</strong> Losing industrial land made reparations harder to pay, coal deliveries drained what was left, and military cuts prevented resistance &mdash; each term made the others worse.</li>
        </ul>
