        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The Treaty of Versailles</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">In <strong>June 1919</strong>, Germany was invited to the Palace of Versailles outside Paris. Its representatives were told to sign the <dfn class="term" data-def="The peace treaty signed on 28 June 1919 at the Palace of Versailles that officially ended World War One between Germany and the Allied Powers. It imposed severe military, territorial, and economic penalties on Germany.">Treaty of Versailles</dfn> or face invasion. They had no choice. Germany had been excluded from all negotiations &mdash; the terms were decided by the Big Three and handed over as a <dfn class="term" data-def="A German term meaning 'dictated peace.' Germans used this word to describe the Treaty of Versailles because they had no say in the negotiations and were forced to accept the terms under threat of invasion.">Diktat</dfn>, a dictated peace with no discussion allowed.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Treaty Categories</div>
          <p>The Treaty punished Germany across four main areas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Military Terms</strong> &mdash; severe restrictions on armed forces</li>
            <li><strong>Territorial Terms</strong> &mdash; loss of land in Europe and overseas</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Terms</strong> &mdash; <dfn class="term" data-def="Financial compensation demanded from Germany by the Allied Powers for the damage caused during World War One. The final sum was set at &pound;6.6 billion in 1921.">reparations</dfn> and resource extraction</li>

        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Military Terms</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">The Treaty stripped Germany&rsquo;s military power. For a country where the army was a source of huge national pride and respect, these terms were deeply humiliating.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n9">Territorial Terms</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">Germany lost <strong>10% of its land</strong> and <strong>12% of its population</strong>, along with all overseas colonies. These losses stripped the country of key industrial regions, farmland, and millions of German-speaking citizens.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n17">Economic Terms</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">The economic penalties aimed to weaken Germany and compensate the Allies for war damage. Combined with the loss of land, they crippled Germany&rsquo;s ability to recover.</p>

France would receive <strong>50%</strong> (they had wanted 70%), Britain <strong>30%</strong>, and the rest shared among smaller allies.

        <h2 data-narration-id="n22">Article 231: The War Guilt Clause</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">The most hated part of the Treaty was <strong>Article 231</strong> &mdash; the <dfn class="term" data-def="Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles, which forced Germany to accept sole responsibility for causing World War One. It was used to justify the reparations and other punishments imposed on Germany.">War Guilt Clause</dfn>. It forced Germany to accept <strong>total blame</strong> for starting the war.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n24">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Article 231</div>
          <p>The War Guilt Clause had a key legal purpose: by saying Germany alone started the war, the Allies could justify every other punishment &mdash; reparations, disarmament, and land losses. Without Article 231, they had no formal basis for such severe terms.</p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n25">Germans were furious. Many did not believe they were solely to blame &mdash; Austria-Hungary had declared war on Serbia, and Russia had been the first to mobilise troops. German propaganda had told the public they were fighting a defensive war. The clause felt like a lie imposed by the victors, and it fuelled lasting resentment that nationalist politicians would exploit for years.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n26">How the Terms Connected</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n27">The Treaty&rsquo;s punishments were not separate &mdash; they reinforced each other, making Germany&rsquo;s situation far worse than any single term alone.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n28">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Interconnected Terms</div>
          <p>Losing industrial regions like the <strong>Saar</strong> and <strong>Upper Silesia</strong> (26% of coal, half of iron and steel) directly made it harder to pay &pound;6.6 billion in reparations. Being forced to deliver coal to France, Belgium, and Italy on top of this created an impossible situation. Military restrictions meant Germany could not resist by force. The Treaty was a compromise &mdash; none of the Big Three got everything they wanted &mdash; but for Germany, it was crushing.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Treaty dismantled German power through military, territorial, and economic penalties, all justified by Article 231. Germany was excluded from negotiations and forced to sign under threat of invasion, creating deep resentment that shaped European politics for decades.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Germany was attacked on every front:</strong> 100,000-man army, 10% of land lost, &pound;6.6 billion in reparations, and forced to accept sole war guilt &mdash; the penalties left Germany weakened, humiliated, and angry.</li>
          <li><strong>Article 231 was the foundation:</strong> The War Guilt Clause legally justified every other punishment. Without it, the Allies had no formal basis for reparations or disarmament.</li>
          <li><strong>The terms reinforced each other:</strong> Losing industrial land made reparations harder to pay, coal deliveries drained what was left, and military cuts prevented resistance &mdash; each term made the others worse.</li>
        </ul>

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of how different terms combined to weaken Germany in interconnected ways.\nExample: The Treaty attacked Germany on multiple fronts simultaneously, and the terms reinforced each other. The army was cut to 100,000 men with no air force, tanks, or submarines, and the Rhineland was demilitarised \u2014 leaving Germany militarily defenceless. At the same time, territorial losses stripped 10% of Germany\u2019s land, including 26% of its coal and half its iron and steel capacity. These industrial losses directly undermined Germany\u2019s ability to pay the \u00a36.6 billion reparations bill, yet forced coal deliveries to France, Belgium, and Italy drained what remained. Article 231 tied everything together by forcing Germany to accept sole blame for the war, giving the Allies legal justification for every restriction.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why one set of terms weakened Germany.\nExample: The military terms significantly weakened Germany. The army was cut to 100,000 men with no conscription, no tanks, no air force, and no submarines. The navy was limited to 6 battleships. The Rhineland was demilitarised, removing any ability to defend the western border. For a country that prided itself on its military strength, these restrictions were deeply humiliating and left Germany defenceless against well-armed neighbours.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Germany lost 10% of its land under the Treaty. Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France and the Polish Corridor split Germany in two. Germany also had to pay \u00a36.6 billion in reparations.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: Germany had to reduce its army and pay money. / Germany lost land and military power.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of how territorial losses had interconnected political, economic, and national consequences.\nExample: The territorial losses affected Germany far beyond the map. Losing Alsace-Lorraine, the Saar, and Upper Silesia stripped Germany of 26% of its coal and half its iron and steel \u2014 resources essential for paying the \u00a36.6 billion reparations bill. The Polish Corridor split Germany in two, cutting off East Prussia and placing the German-speaking city of Danzig under League control, which was seen as a denial of self-determination. The ban on Anschluss with Austria deepened this injustice \u2014 Wilson\u2019s own Fourteen Points had championed self-determination, yet it was being denied to German-speaking peoples. All colonies were taken as mandates, ending Germany\u2019s status as a global power.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why one aspect of territorial loss affected Germany.\nExample: The territorial terms were economically devastating. The Saar coalfields were given to France under League control for 15 years, and Upper Silesia went to Poland. In total, Germany lost 26% of its coal and half its iron and steel capacity. These losses made economic recovery far harder and directly undermined Germany\u2019s ability to pay reparations.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Germany lost 10% of its land and 12% of its population. Alsace-Lorraine went back to France and the Polish Corridor gave Poland access to the sea at Danzig. Germany also lost all overseas colonies, given to Allied powers as mandates under the League of Nations.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: Germany lost a lot of land because of the Treaty. / The Polish Corridor split Germany in two.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of how economic punishments interacted with other terms to create a devastating combined effect.\nExample: The economic punishment went beyond the headline reparations figure. The \u00a36.6 billion bill \u2014 about 8% of national income \u2014 was set by a commission in 1921, two years after Germany signed without knowing the amount. But the Treaty also stripped the resources needed to pay: the Saar went to France, Upper Silesia to Poland, and Germany lost 26% of coal and half of iron and steel. On top of this, forced coal deliveries to France, Belgium, and Italy drained what remained. The interconnection was devastating \u2014 Germany was expected to pay an enormous bill while simultaneously being stripped of the industrial capacity to earn it.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why one economic punishment affected Germany.\nExample: Reparations were the most significant economic punishment. The \u00a36.6 billion bill gave France 50% and Britain 30%. The sum was so enormous it was estimated to take until 1988 to pay off. Crucially, the exact amount was not revealed until 1921, meaning Germany had signed up to an open-ended financial commitment without knowing the figure. This created uncertainty and crippled economic planning.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Germany had to pay \u00a36.6 billion in reparations to the Allies. They also had to make coal deliveries to France, Belgium, and Italy. Germany lost industrial regions like the Saar and Upper Silesia which contained important resources.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: The military terms were a source of resentment, especially for nationalists who prided themselves on Germany\u2019s armed forces. But the reparations had a wider and longer-lasting impact on ordinary Germans. The \u00a36.6 billion bill combined with the loss of 26% of coal and half of iron and steel created widespread poverty. The effects went beyond the figure itself \u2014 they contributed to hyperinflation and the French invasion of the Ruhr in 1923 when Germany defaulted on payments. Land losses were linked because they made reparations harder to pay. Overall, reparations were more damaging over a longer period and were hated by a larger section of the population because of the poverty and starvation which accompanied them.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The military terms were hated because Germany was left weak and defenceless, surrounded by armed neighbours. The army was cut to 100,000 men with no conscription, tanks, air force, or submarines. The navy was limited to 6 battleships. The Rhineland was demilitarised. German militarism had been a source of particular pride before the war, so this was seen as a deliberate attempt to humiliate Germany and reduce its status in the world.\nExample (other factor): Land losses were also deeply hated, especially the Polish Corridor splitting Germany in two. The Saar was granted to France for 15 years of coal mining. Anschluss was banned, denying self-determination to German-speaking peoples. Reparations of \u00a36.6 billion were hated because the final figure was not set when Germany was forced to sign, and the sum was seen as impossible to pay.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The military terms were hated because Germany was left weak and defenceless, surrounded by armed neighbours. Germany was denied modern weapons such as tanks and military aircraft, and the army was limited to 100,000 men. Other terms were also hated because of the severity of land losses and reparations payments.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Germany\u2019s army was made very small. / Germany also lost land and had to pay money.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: Article 231 was deeply hated because it branded Germany as solely responsible for the war \u2014 a claim most Germans rejected since Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia and Russia mobilised first. Its true significance was as the legal foundation for every other punishment. Without the War Guilt Clause, the Allies had no formal basis for demanding reparations, stripping territory, or dismantling the military. However, the reparations and territorial losses arguably caused more practical suffering \u2014 losing 26% of coal and half of iron and steel while paying \u00a36.6 billion created poverty that affected millions. Article 231 was the moral insult; reparations and territorial losses were the material damage. The clause\u2019s role as the legal justification for everything else arguably makes it the most significant single term.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Article 231 was deeply hated because it forced Germany to accept total blame for starting the war. Most Germans did not believe they were solely responsible \u2014 Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia and Russia mobilised first. German propaganda had told the public they were fighting a defensive war, so the clause felt like a lie imposed by the victors. Crucially, it served a legal function: it provided the formal justification for all other punishments including reparations, disarmament, and territorial losses.\nExample (other factor): The reparations bill of \u00a36.6 billion was also deeply hated because it caused direct economic suffering. France received 50% and Britain 30%. The sum was estimated to take until 1988 to pay. Combined with the loss of 26% of coal and half of iron and steel capacity through territorial losses, many Germans felt the economic terms were designed to ruin the country permanently.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The military restrictions were also hated because the army was cut to 100,000 men with no air force, tanks, or submarines.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: The economic terms caused the most widespread suffering because they affected ordinary Germans directly. The \u00a36.6 billion reparations bill \u2014 about 8% of national income \u2014 combined with the loss of 26% of coal and half of iron and steel created an impossible situation. Germany was expected to pay an enormous sum while being stripped of the industrial capacity to earn it. The effects were long-lasting, contributing to hyperinflation and political instability. However, the military terms also had consequences beyond simple humiliation. Demilitarising the Rhineland and limiting the army to 100,000 left Germany unable to resist when France invaded the Ruhr in 1923 over unpaid reparations. The terms were interconnected: economic weakness was made worse by military weakness, since Germany could not defend itself or resist enforcement of economic punishments.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s).

The sum was estimated to take until 1988 to pay, and the exact figure was not revealed until two years after signing. On top of reparations, forced coal deliveries to France, Belgium, and Italy drained resources needed for recovery. The loss of the Saar and Upper Silesia meant Germany lost 26% of its coal and half its iron and steel, making it even harder to generate the wealth needed to pay.\nExample (other factor): The military terms were deeply humiliating. Germany\u2019s army was reduced to 100,000 men with no tanks, air force, or submarines. The Rhineland was demilitarised. For a nation that prided itself on its military, being left defenceless among well-armed neighbours was a source of intense resentment and shame.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The military restrictions were also damaging because they left Germany defenceless. The army was cut to 100,000 men with no modern weapons. The Rhineland was demilitarised.
