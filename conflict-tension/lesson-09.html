        <p data-narration-id="n2">If Manchuria wounded the League, <dfn class="term" data-def="The African nation now known as Ethiopia. In the 1930s it was one of the few independent African countries and a member of the League of Nations. Italy invaded Abyssinia in October 1935, and the League&rsquo;s failure to protect it destroyed the League&rsquo;s credibility.">Abyssinia</dfn> killed it. This was not a distant conflict in Asia &mdash; it was a major European power invading a fellow League member, right on Europe&rsquo;s doorstep. The League&rsquo;s failure proved that collective security was dead.</p>

        <!-- BACKGROUND -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">Background: Mussolini&rsquo;s Ambitions</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Italy&rsquo;s fascist dictator, <strong>Mussolini</strong>, dreamed of building a new Roman Empire. Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia) was a prime target. It was the <strong>only independent black country in Africa</strong> and sat between two Italian colonies (Eritrea and Italian Somaliland). It was rich in resources. Mussolini also wanted <strong>revenge</strong> for Italy&rsquo;s humiliating defeat by Abyssinia at the Battle of Adwa in <strong>1896</strong>.</p>

In <strong>June 1935</strong>, he spoke at the League in Geneva, warning of what would happen if they failed to act.</p>

        <!-- LEAGUE'S RESPONSE -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n6">The League&rsquo;s Response &mdash; and Failure</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">Britain and France faced a dilemma. They were worried about <strong>Hitler&rsquo;s Germany</strong> and wanted to keep Mussolini as an ally against the Nazi threat. Protecting Abyssinia risked pushing Italy towards Germany. They chose <strong>self-interest</strong> over the League&rsquo;s principles.</p>

        <p>If comparing Manchuria and Abyssinia, argue <strong>Abyssinia was more damaging</strong>. In Manchuria, the League could claim the crisis was too far away. In Abyssinia, a <strong>permanent Council member</strong> broke the Covenant &mdash; and Britain and France actively undermined the League through the Hoare-Laval Pact. This was not just failure; it was betrayal from within. For &ldquo;Write an account&rdquo; questions, show how the crisis <strong>escalated</strong>: Italy invaded, the League&rsquo;s sanctions were useless, and then Hoare-Laval made it even worse.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n22">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Abyssinian Crisis ended the League as a serious force. Britain and France put self-interest first, sanctions were deliberately useless, and the Hoare-Laval Pact proved the League&rsquo;s own leaders did not believe in it. After Abyssinia, countries rearmed and formed their own alliances instead.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Self-interest over the League:</strong> Britain and France wanted Mussolini as an ally against Hitler and sacrificed Abyssinia to keep him. The Hoare-Laval Pact proved the League&rsquo;s leaders did not believe in collective security.</li>
          <li><strong>Useless sanctions:</strong> Oil, coal, and steel were excluded. The Suez Canal stayed open. Even when the League acted, its actions were designed to fail.</li>
          <li><strong>Devastating knock-on effects:</strong> Mussolini allied with Hitler (Rome-Berlin Axis). Hitler remilitarised the Rhineland while the world was distracted. Countries lost faith, rearmed, and formed secret alliances. The path to war was wide open.</li>
        </ul>
