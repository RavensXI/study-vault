        <p data-narration-id="n2">If Manchuria wounded the League, <dfn class="term" data-def="The African nation now known as Ethiopia. In the 1930s it was one of the few independent African countries and a member of the League of Nations.

This was not a distant conflict in Asia &mdash; it was a major European power invading a fellow League member, right on Europe&rsquo;s doorstep. The League&rsquo;s failure proved that collective security was dead.</p>

        <!-- BACKGROUND -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">Background: Mussolini&rsquo;s Ambitions</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Italy&rsquo;s fascist dictator, <strong>Mussolini</strong>, dreamed of building a new Roman Empire. Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia) was a prime target. It was the <strong>only independent black country in Africa</strong> and sat between two Italian colonies (Eritrea and Italian Somaliland). It was rich in resources. Mussolini also wanted <strong>revenge</strong> for Italy&rsquo;s humiliating defeat by Abyssinia at the Battle of Adwa in <strong>1896</strong>.</p>

In <strong>June 1935</strong>, he spoke at the League in Geneva, warning of what would happen if they failed to act.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n6">The League&rsquo;s Response &mdash; and Failure</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">Britain and France faced a dilemma. They were worried about <strong>Hitler&rsquo;s Germany</strong> and wanted to keep Mussolini as an ally against the Nazi threat. Protecting Abyssinia risked pushing Italy towards Germany. They chose <strong>self-interest</strong> over the League&rsquo;s principles.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>If comparing Manchuria and Abyssinia, argue <strong>Abyssinia was more damaging</strong>. In Manchuria, the League could claim the crisis was too far away. In Abyssinia, a <strong>permanent Council member</strong> broke the Covenant &mdash; and Britain and France actively undermined the League through the Hoare-Laval Pact. This was not just failure; it was betrayal from within. For &ldquo;Write an account&rdquo; questions, show how the crisis <strong>escalated</strong>: Italy invaded, the League&rsquo;s sanctions were useless, and then Hoare-Laval made it even worse.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n22">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Abyssinian Crisis ended the League as a serious force. Britain and France put self-interest first, sanctions were deliberately useless, and the Hoare-Laval Pact proved the League&rsquo;s own leaders did not believe in it. After Abyssinia, countries rearmed and formed their own alliances instead.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Self-interest over the League:</strong> Britain and France wanted Mussolini as an ally against Hitler and sacrificed Abyssinia to keep him. The Hoare-Laval Pact proved the League&rsquo;s leaders did not believe in collective security.</li>
          <li><strong>Useless sanctions:</strong> Oil, coal, and steel were excluded. The Suez Canal stayed open. Even when the League acted, its actions were designed to fail.</li>
          <li><strong>Devastating knock-on effects:</strong> Mussolini allied with Hitler (Rome-Berlin Axis). Hitler remilitarised the Rhineland while the world was distracted. Countries lost faith, rearmed, and formed secret alliances. The path to war was wide open.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY events in Abyssinia destroyed the League.\nExample: The events showed the League was openly sabotaged by the actions of leading member nations. Italy, a permanent Council member, invaded Abyssinia in October 1935 using tanks, aircraft, and poison gas. The League imposed economic sanctions but deliberately excluded oil, coal, and steel \u2014 the very resources Italy needed for war \u2014 and left the Suez Canal open. The League was further undermined by the secret Hoare-Laval Pact (December 1935), in which Britain and France tried to give Mussolini two-thirds of Abyssinia. This showed that self-interest was their priority; they wanted to keep Mussolini on their side rather than Hitler\u2019s. When the pact was leaked, both ministers were forced to resign, but the damage to the League\u2019s credibility was irreversible. Italy conquered Abyssinia in May 1936 and left the League.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: Mussolini\u2019s invasion of Abyssinia showed that the League lacked the strength to prevent acts of aggression because the only way it could have any influence was by imposing trade sanctions. However, the sanctions against Italy in 1935\u201336 did not include oil, coal, or steel, so Mussolini\u2019s military capability was not compromised. Britain also refused to close the Suez Canal, the main route for Italian supply ships, because it feared this would push Mussolini towards an alliance with Hitler.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Italy invaded Abyssinia in October 1935 and the League imposed sanctions. But the sanctions did not include oil or coal. The Hoare-Laval Pact was a secret deal that tried to give Italy most of Abyssinia. Italy conquered Abyssinia in May 1936 and then left the League.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. General statements with basic knowledge.\nExample: Italy invaded Abyssinia and the League could not stop it. / The sanctions were too weak to make a difference.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY the pact had such devastating consequences.\nExample: The Hoare-Laval Pact (December 1935) was the ultimate betrayal of the League because it was drawn up in secret by the League\u2019s two most powerful members. British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare and French Prime Minister Pierre Laval proposed giving Mussolini two-thirds of Abyssinia in exchange for ending the war. When leaked to the press, it caused a public outcry and both men were forced to resign. The damage went far beyond personal careers: it proved that Britain and France did not believe in collective security \u2014 they were willing to reward an aggressor by carving up a fellow League member to serve their own strategic interests of keeping Mussolini as an ally against Hitler. After this, no small nation could trust the League to protect it. The credibility of collective security was destroyed.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: The Hoare-Laval Pact was drawn up secretly by Samuel Hoare and Pierre Laval in December 1935. It proposed giving Mussolini two-thirds of Abyssinia while the League was supposedly imposing sanctions against Italy for its invasion. When the plan was leaked to the press, there was huge public outrage. Both Hoare and Laval were forced to resign. The pact showed that the League\u2019s own leaders were undermining it from within.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Britain and France made a secret deal to give Italy most of Abyssinia. It was leaked and both ministers had to resign. This showed that the League\u2019s leaders did not believe in collective security.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning, showing understanding of HOW/WHY Abyssinia\u2019s consequences contributed to war.\nExample: The Abyssinian Crisis had a cascade of consequences that made war more likely. While the world was distracted, Hitler remilitarised the Rhineland in March 1936 \u2014 a direct violation of Versailles \u2014 and no one stopped him. Italy\u2019s success encouraged Mussolini to ally with Hitler, forming the Rome-Berlin Axis in October 1936. Countries lost faith in the League and began rearming and forming their own alliances instead of relying on collective security. The League\u2019s failure proved that aggression would not be punished \u2014 a lesson Hitler applied repeatedly in the late 1930s with the Anschluss and Sudetenland. Haile Selassie\u2019s warning to the League \u2014 \u2018It is us today. It will be you tomorrow\u2019 \u2014 proved tragically prophetic.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account with a range of accurate knowledge. Shows analysis of how/why at one stage.\nExample: Italy\u2019s conquest of Abyssinia (May 1936) pushed Mussolini towards an alliance with Hitler, and the Rome-Berlin Axis was formed in October 1936. This was significant because it united two aggressive dictators. Meanwhile, Hitler used the distraction of the Abyssinian Crisis to remilitarise the Rhineland in March 1936. Countries lost faith in the League and began rearming instead.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: After Abyssinia, Hitler remilitarised the Rhineland in March 1936 because the world was distracted. Italy and Germany formed the Rome-Berlin Axis in October 1936. Countries stopped trusting the League and started rearming.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: Self-interest was the decisive factor because Britain and France controlled the League and repeatedly chose to undermine it. Over Abyssinia, they formed the Stresa Front with Italy (April 1935) and deliberately avoided mentioning Abyssinia, which Mussolini took as a green light. When Italy invaded, Britain refused to close the Suez Canal and sanctions excluded oil, coal, and steel. The Hoare-Laval Pact (December 1935) tried to give Mussolini two-thirds of Abyssinia \u2014 the ultimate betrayal. Over Manchuria, Britain wanted to maintain good trading relations with Japan. However, structural weaknesses also contributed. The absence of the USA meant sanctions were incomplete \u2014 over Abyssinia, the USA continued trading with Italy. The League had no army and relied on members providing troops. The Great Depression made nations unwilling to risk their fragile economies. Self-interest was the main cause, but structural flaws ensured the League could not overcome it.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Britain and France wanted to keep Mussolini as an ally against Hitler, so they sacrificed Abyssinia. At the Stresa Front (April 1935), they deliberately avoided mentioning Abyssinia. Sanctions excluded oil, coal, and steel \u2014 a speech in the House of Commons warned that banning coal would cost 30,000 British miners their jobs. Britain refused to close the Suez Canal. The Hoare-Laval Pact (December 1935) secretly tried to reward Mussolini with two-thirds of Abyssinia. This was not just failure but active betrayal.\nExample (other factor): The League\u2019s organisation was also a weakness. It had no army and relied on members providing troops. Sanctions depended on all countries cooperating, but non-League members like the USA continued trading with Italy. The League\u2019s slow decision-making \u2014 the Assembly met only once a year \u2014 meant it could not respond quickly to aggression.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The Great Depression also weakened the League. Countries turned to protectionism and refused to impose sanctions that might damage their own economies. The Depression fuelled extremism and aggressive leaders like Mussolini who exploited economic chaos to pursue territorial expansion.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Britain and France put their own interests first instead of supporting the League. / The League had no army to stop aggressors.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: The Great Depression destroyed international cooperation. After the Wall Street Crash (1929), countries turned to protectionism and refused to impose sanctions that might damage their own fragile economies. Britain and France slashed military spending, leaving them unable to back up the League with force. The Depression fuelled aggressive regimes \u2014 Japan invaded Manchuria for resources, and Hitler exploited mass unemployment to rise to power. Over Abyssinia, Britain argued that banning coal exports to Italy would cost 30,000 British miners their jobs. However, the League had structural weaknesses before the Depression. Its leading members\u2019 self-interest was the deeper problem: over Abyssinia, Britain and France formed the Stresa Front with Italy and deliberately avoided mentioning the crisis, then the Hoare-Laval Pact tried to give Mussolini two-thirds of Abyssinia. Sanctions excluded oil, coal, and steel, and the Suez Canal was kept open. The Depression made self-interest worse, but it did not create it.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The Depression crippled the League because countries turned inward. Nations refused to impose sanctions on aggressors because they feared damaging their own economies. Britain and France cut military spending. The Depression drove Japan\u2019s military to invade Manchuria for resources and helped Hitler rise to power. Over Abyssinia, economic fears meant sanctions excluded oil, coal, and steel.\nExample (other factor): The self-interest of Britain and France was equally important. Over Abyssinia, they wanted to keep Mussolini as an ally against Hitler. The Stresa Front (April 1935) deliberately avoided mentioning Abyssinia. Britain refused to close the Suez Canal. The Hoare-Laval Pact (December 1935) tried to reward Mussolini with two-thirds of Abyssinia. These were choices driven by strategic interest, not just economic hardship.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The absence of the USA was also a major weakness. America was not a League member and continued trading with Italy during the Abyssinian Crisis. Without the world\u2019s strongest economy, sanctions could never be fully effective. The USA\u2019s absence reduced the League\u2019s credibility from the start.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The Depression made countries too poor to help the League. / Countries were too busy with their own problems to stop aggressors.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Complex, sustained line of reasoning which is sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress from developed explanation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes to form a sustained judgement.\nExample: The League\u2019s lack of enforcement power was a fundamental flaw. It had no permanent army and could only use moral condemnation or economic sanctions. Over Abyssinia, sanctions were imposed but deliberately excluded oil, coal, and steel \u2014 making them useless. The Suez Canal was left open for Italian supply ships. Members could simply leave the League if they disagreed: Japan left in 1933, Germany in 1933, Italy in 1937. However, the League did have enforcement tools \u2014 it was the self-interest of its members that prevented their use. Over Abyssinia, Britain refused to close the Suez Canal not because it lacked the power but because it feared pushing Mussolini towards Hitler. The Hoare-Laval Pact (December 1935) tried to give Mussolini two-thirds of Abyssinia. Sanctions excluded oil because Britain feared the economic consequences \u2014 a speech in the House of Commons warned it would cost 30,000 British miners their jobs. The League had some power to enforce; its members chose not to use it.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one reason has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): The League had no army and relied on members providing troops, which none were willing to do. Over Abyssinia, sanctions excluded oil, coal, and steel \u2014 the very resources Italy needed for war. Non-League members like the USA continued trading with Italy, undermining any economic pressure. Members could leave the League with no consequences \u2014 Japan (1933), Germany (1933), and Italy (1937) all did so. Without military force or effective sanctions, the League was toothless.\nExample (other factor): The self-interest of Britain and France was equally important. Over Abyssinia, they wanted to keep Mussolini as an ally against Hitler. The Stresa Front (April 1935) deliberately avoided mentioning Abyssinia. Britain controlled the Suez Canal but refused to close it. The Hoare-Laval Pact tried to reward the aggressor. Sanctions were deliberately weak \u2014 the League had some enforcement power, but its leaders chose not to use it.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge and understanding. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: The absence of the USA also weakened enforcement. America was not a League member and continued trading with Italy during the Abyssinian Crisis. Without the world\u2019s strongest economic power, sanctions could never be fully effective. The USA\u2019s absence reduced the League\u2019s authority from the start.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The League had no army so countries could ignore it. / Sanctions did not work because they were too weak.\n\n0 marks: No evidence or fails to address the question.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.
