        <p data-narration-id="n2">If the Manchurian Crisis severely wounded the League of Nations, <dfn class="term" data-def="The African nation now known as Ethiopia. In the 1930s it was one of the few independent African countries and a member of the League of Nations. Italy invaded Abyssinia in October 1935, and the League&rsquo;s failure to protect it destroyed the League&rsquo;s credibility.">Abyssinia</dfn> was the fatal blow. This was not a distant conflict in the Far East &mdash; it was a clear case of a large European nation invading a smaller League member state, right on Europe&rsquo;s doorstep. The League&rsquo;s failure to stop it proved beyond doubt that collective security was dead.</p>

        <!-- BACKGROUND -->
        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">Background: Mussolini&rsquo;s Ambitions</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Italy&rsquo;s fascist dictator, <strong>Mussolini</strong>, dreamed of building a new Roman Empire. Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia) was a tempting target: it sat between two existing Italian colonies in East Africa (Eritrea and Italian Somaliland), it was rich in natural resources, and conquering it would avenge Italy&rsquo;s humiliating defeat at the Battle of Adwa in 1896.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>In December 1934, a clash between Italian and Abyssinian troops at the <strong>Wal-Wal oasis</strong> on the border with Italian Somaliland gave Mussolini the pretext he needed.

        <p data-narration-id="n7">Britain and France &mdash; the League&rsquo;s most powerful members &mdash; faced a dilemma. They were growing increasingly worried about <strong>Hitler&rsquo;s Germany</strong> and desperately wanted to keep Mussolini as an ally against the Nazi threat. Protecting Abyssinia risked pushing Italy towards Germany.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>If asked to compare the Manchurian and Abyssinian crises, argue that <strong>Abyssinia was more significant</strong>. In Manchuria, the League could claim the crisis was too far away. In Abyssinia, a major European League member invaded a fellow member state &mdash; and the League&rsquo;s two leading powers (Britain and France) actively undermined its response through the Hoare-Laval Pact. This was not just failure; it was betrayal from within.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n22">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Abyssinian Crisis was the final nail in the League&rsquo;s coffin. It proved beyond doubt that Britain and France&rsquo;s national interests would always come before collective security, and that the League was powerless to protect its own members from aggression. After Abyssinia, the League was irrelevant.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Britain and France chose self-interest over collective security:</strong> They wanted Mussolini as an ally against Hitler and were willing to sacrifice Abyssinia &mdash; a fellow League member &mdash; to keep him on side. The Hoare-Laval Pact was the ultimate proof that the League&rsquo;s leading members did not believe in its principles.</li>
          <li><strong>Sanctions without teeth are meaningless:</strong> The League imposed sanctions but deliberately excluded the resources Italy actually needed (oil, steel, coal) and left the Suez Canal open. This demonstrated that even when the League acted, its actions were designed to be ineffective.</li>
          <li><strong>The crisis had devastating knock-on effects:</strong> It pushed Mussolini into alliance with Hitler (the Rome-Berlin Axis), distracted the world while Hitler remilitarised the Rhineland, and destroyed any remaining faith in the League. The path to World War Two was now wide open.</li>
        </ul>
