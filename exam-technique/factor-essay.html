              <p>&lsquo;The main reason for the failure of the League of Nations was the absence of the USA.&rsquo; How far do you agree with this statement? [16 marks + 4 SPaG]</p>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-model-paragraph">
              <span class="guide-annotation">Stated Factor + Evidence</span>
              <p>The absence of the USA was a major reason the League of Nations failed. Without America, the League lost its most powerful potential member, which weakened both its economic sanctions and its moral authority. For example, when Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931, the League could not impose effective trade sanctions because the USA &mdash; Japan&rsquo;s biggest trading partner &mdash; was not a member. This meant the League&rsquo;s main weapon was useless, making it easy for aggressive nations to ignore its rulings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-model-paragraph">
              <span class="guide-annotation">Other Factor + Comparison</span>
              <p>However, the structure of the League itself was also a critical weakness. Decisions in the Assembly and Council required unanimous agreement, which meant any single member could block action. Britain and France, the League&rsquo;s leading members, were often reluctant to act because they were recovering from the First World War and prioritised their own interests. During the Abyssinia Crisis in 1935, Britain and France secretly agreed the Hoare&ndash;Laval Pact to give Mussolini two-thirds of Abyssinia rather than confront him. This suggests the League would have struggled even with American membership, because its own decision-making process was fatally slow.</p>

            <div class="guide-model-paragraph">
              <span class="guide-annotation">Judgement</span>
              <p>Overall, I agree with the statement to a large extent. While the League&rsquo;s structure was flawed, these weaknesses were magnified by America&rsquo;s absence. With the USA inside the League, economic sanctions would have had real teeth and aggressive nations would have faced a united front. The structural problems could have been overcome with strong leadership, but without America there was no leader powerful enough to make the League work.</p>

              <p>&lsquo;Science and technology has been the main factor in the development of medicine since medieval times.&rsquo; How far do you agree? [16 marks + 4 SPaG]</p>

              <p>Science helped medicine get better. Pasteur discovered germs and this was really important for medicine. Before that, people believed in the Four Humours and miasma. Koch found the bacteria that caused diseases like tuberculosis and cholera. Jenner also made a smallpox vaccine earlier, in 1796. These are all examples of how science improved medicine over time.</p>

              <p>Science and technology was a significant factor in the development of medicine. Pasteur&rsquo;s Germ Theory (1861) proved that microorganisms caused disease, overturning centuries of belief in miasma. This was crucial because it gave doctors a scientific target for the first time &mdash; Robert Koch built on this by identifying the specific bacteria causing tuberculosis (1882) and cholera (1883), allowing public health officials to tackle the real causes of epidemics rather than simply cleaning up bad smells.</p>

            <p><em>A full Level 4 answer would continue with a counter-argument (e.g. government action was equally important), then a conclusion with a clear judgement &mdash; see the model answer above.</em></p>

        <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
        <ul class="guide-mistakes">
          <li class="guide-mistake">
            <span class="guide-mistake-icon">&#10060;</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Only writing about the stated factor</strong> &mdash; You MUST discuss at least one other factor to reach Level 3+. The question asks &ldquo;how far&rdquo; you agree, which requires weighing alternatives.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="guide-mistake">
            <span class="guide-mistake-icon">&#10060;</span>
            <div>
              <strong>No judgement in the conclusion</strong> &mdash; &ldquo;Both factors were important&rdquo; is not a judgement. You must say which factor matters MORE and explain why.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="guide-mistake">
            <span class="guide-mistake-icon">&#10060;</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Telling the story without explaining</strong> &mdash; Describing what happened (narrative) only reaches Level 2. You need to explain WHY factors were important and HOW they connect to the question.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="guide-mistake">
            <span class="guide-mistake-icon">&#10060;</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Ignoring SPaG</strong> &mdash; 4 marks for spelling, punctuation and grammar is almost a full grade boundary. Use paragraphs, spell key terms correctly, and leave 2 minutes to proofread.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="guide-mistake">
            <span class="guide-mistake-icon">&#10060;</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Spending too long on this question</strong> &mdash; 25 minutes maximum. Students often overwrite the essay and run out of time for earlier questions worth easy marks.
