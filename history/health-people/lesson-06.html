        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Introduction: A Time of Transition</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The 18th century was a time of transition for medicine in Britain. Vesalius, Par&eacute;, and Harvey had made important breakthroughs, but many old ideas about disease and treatment <strong>stubbornly persisted</strong>. This lesson looks at what stayed the same (<dfn class="term" data-def="Things that stay the same over time.">continuity</dfn>) and what was genuinely new (<dfn class="term" data-def="New developments, ideas, or practices that represent a break from the past.">change</dfn>) in how people understood and treated disease.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">What Stayed the Same (Continuity)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Even though science was becoming more important, many old ideas about disease were still popular among ordinary people.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n5">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Persistent Old Beliefs</div>
          <ul data-narration-id="n20">
            <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="The theory that disease was caused by 'bad air' or foul-smelling vapours rising from rotting matter, swamps, or sewage.">Miasma</dfn></strong> &mdash; the belief that &ldquo;bad air&rdquo; or foul smells caused illness &mdash; was still widely accepted.</li>
            <li>The ancient Greek idea of the <dfn class="term" data-def="An ancient Greek medical theory, developed by Hippocrates and Galen, which claimed the body contained four liquids (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile) that needed to be in balance for good health.">Four Humours</dfn> had not disappeared entirely.</li>
            <li>Many people still believed that illness was a <strong>punishment from God</strong>.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Medical &ldquo;Marketplace&rdquo;</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">For most people, healthcare in the 1600s&ndash;1700s was like a <strong>marketplace</strong> &mdash; they could choose between different practitioners, none of whom were reliably effective:</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Who Could You Visit for Medical Help?</div>
          <ul data-narration-id="n21">
            <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="Practitioners who combined haircutting with minor surgery such as tooth-pulling, bloodletting, and treating wounds.">Barber-surgeons</dfn>:</strong> Poorly trained practitioners who gave haircuts <em>and</em> performed minor operations like tooth-pulling and bloodletting. Surgery was seen as a low-status craft.</li>
            <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A person who prepared and sold medicines and herbal remedies.">Apothecaries</dfn>:</strong> Sold medicines and potions, often with little formal training. They were the forerunners of modern pharmacists and often the only medical help for poorer people.</li>
            <li><strong>Wise women:</strong> Used traditional knowledge of herbs and plants, sometimes mixed with superstition. Often the first point of contact for rural communities.</li>
            <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of unqualified or fraudulent people selling fake medicines and promising miracle cures.">Quack doctors</dfn>:</strong> Travelling salesmen who sold fake &ldquo;cure-all&rdquo; medicines. There was no regulation to stop them, and desperate people were easy targets.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">The lack of regulation meant medical treatment was very inconsistent. Wealthy patients could afford physicians, but even physicians often relied on outdated ideas like bloodletting and purging.</p>

        <h3>New Treatments from Overseas</h3>

        <p>As European exploration expanded in the 16th and 17th centuries, new treatments arrived from abroad:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n22">
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A substance derived from the bark of the cinchona tree in South America.">Quinine</dfn></strong> from South American tree bark was used to treat <dfn class="term" data-def="A dangerous disease spread by mosquito bites, causing recurring fever, chills, and sometimes death.">malaria</dfn> and was one of the first genuinely effective imported medicines.</li>
          <li><strong>Opium</strong> was used as a powerful painkiller, though it caused serious addiction.</li>
          <li><strong>Tobacco</strong> was believed to be a cure-all for almost every illness &mdash; a claim since disproved.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supernatural Beliefs Persisted</h3>

        <p>Even as new scientific ideas spread, supernatural beliefs remained widespread. Many people believed in the <dfn class="term" data-def="The belief that the touch of a reigning monarch could cure scrofula (a form of tuberculosis affecting the lymph nodes in the neck).">King&rsquo;s Touch</dfn> &mdash; the idea that the monarch&rsquo;s touch could cure <dfn class="term" data-def="A form of tuberculosis that affects the lymph nodes in the neck, causing swelling.">scrofula</dfn> (a form of tuberculosis known as the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Evil&rdquo;). Thousands attended royal ceremonies hoping to be healed. This shows how slowly scientific thinking replaced superstition.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n8">What Was New (Change)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">The 18th century was part of the <dfn class="term" data-def="An intellectual movement of the 17th and 18th centuries that emphasised reason, science, and individual rights over tradition and superstition.">Enlightenment</dfn>, when science and reason were becoming very important. This spirit of enquiry began to influence medicine.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n10">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Key Changes in the 18th Century</div>
          <ul data-narration-id="n23">
            <li><strong>The growth of hospitals:</strong> Before, hospitals were mostly places of &ldquo;care&rdquo; run by the Church. New hospitals were now built with the aim of <strong>curing</strong> patients.</li>
            <li><strong>Doctors trained in hospitals:</strong> Physicians began observing patients in wards, learning through direct experience rather than only from books.</li>
            <li><strong>Free dispensaries:</strong> Set up for the poor, these provided medicine and advice without requiring payment for a doctor&rsquo;s visit.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n11">Case Study: John Hunter (1728&ndash;1793)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n12"><strong>John Hunter</strong> shows the new scientific approach to medicine. Often called the <dfn class="term" data-def="A title given to John Hunter in recognition of his pioneering approach to surgery based on scientific observation, experimentation, and anatomical knowledge rather than tradition.">&ldquo;Father of Scientific Surgery&rdquo;</dfn>, he pushed a new way of thinking about medical practice.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">Instead of accepting old ideas from books, Hunter taught that surgeons must learn through <strong>observation and experiment</strong>. He was a skilled <dfn class="term" data-def="A scientist who studies the structure of the human body, including its organs, bones, muscles, and other internal parts.">anatomist</dfn> who carried out many dissections to understand how the body worked.</p>

        <h3>Hunter&rsquo;s Surgical Innovations</h3>

        <p>One of Hunter&rsquo;s most celebrated achievements was treating a <dfn class="term" data-def="A dangerous swelling of a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the vessel wall.">popliteal aneurysm</dfn> &mdash; a dangerously swollen artery behind the knee. The standard treatment was <strong>amputation</strong>, which was brutal and often fatal. Hunter tied off the artery higher up the leg, allowing other blood vessels to expand and keep the leg alive. This showed his approach in action: <strong>observe the problem, hypothesise a solution, test it</strong>.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p>Getting bodies for dissection was a major problem. Henry VIII had granted surgeons just <strong>4 hanged criminals per year</strong> for anatomical study. As demand grew, this was hopelessly inadequate.</p>
              <p>The result was a grim trade in stolen corpses. <dfn class="term" data-def="People who illegally dug up freshly buried corpses from graveyards and sold them to surgeons and medical schools for dissection.">&ldquo;Resurrection men&rdquo;</dfn> stole fresh bodies from graves and sold them to surgeons and medical schools. Hunter himself obtained bodies this way &mdash; many surgeons saw it as a necessary evil.</p>

              <p>Hunter was so dedicated that he deliberately <strong>infected himself with a sexually transmitted disease</strong> to study its effects. This was an extreme and dangerous example of his belief that direct observation was the only way to truly understand disease.</p>
              <p>He also ran a large medical practice, trained <strong>hundreds of students</strong>, and wrote influential books on dentistry, gunshot wounds, and venereal diseases. His teaching shaped a generation of surgeons who spread his evidence-based methods.</p>

        <h3>Hunter and the Professionalisation of Surgery</h3>

        <p>Hunter argued that surgeons and barbers should be <strong>separated</strong> and that surgery should become a respected profession, not a trade practised by people who also cut hair. His campaigning helped establish the <dfn class="term" data-def="The professional body that oversees the practice of surgery in England.">Royal College of Surgeons</dfn> in 1800, which still oversees surgery in England today.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n17">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; John Hunter</div>
          <p>John Hunter promoted <strong>observation and experiment</strong> over reliance on old textbooks. He collected thousands of anatomical specimens to teach students, pioneered new surgical techniques (including tying off aneurysms instead of amputating), and helped establish surgery as a respected profession through the Royal College of Surgeons. His methods helped transform surgery into a respected, evidence-based science.</p>

        <p>For questions about this period, discuss <strong>both continuity and change</strong>. Examiners want to see that you understand progress was not straightforward &mdash; old beliefs like miasma and the Four Humours persisted even as new ideas emerged. A balanced answer covering both sides will score higher marks.</p>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n19">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 18th century was a time of transition. New scientific thinking was taking hold &mdash; especially through figures like John Hunter &mdash; but most people still relied on old beliefs and traditional remedies. Real, widespread change would not come until the 19th century.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n24">
          <li><strong>Old beliefs persisted:</strong> Miasma, the Four Humours, and supernatural explanations remained common, alongside quackery and herbal remedies.</li>
          <li><strong>New institutions emerged:</strong> Hospitals shifted from care to cure, doctors trained through observation, and free dispensaries helped the poor.</li>
          <li><strong>John Hunter bridged old and new:</strong> He championed observation and experimentation, helping transform surgery into a respected, evidence-based profession.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of aspects of significance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining the relationship between aspects of significance, for example over time.\nExample: The Renaissance was significant because it created a shift in attitudes that made future breakthroughs possible. The rediscovery of accurate anatomical observation by Vesalius (1543) challenged Galen\u2019s errors after 1,300 years, but its full impact was slow \u2014 most doctors continued to follow Galen. The printing press allowed new ideas to spread faster than ever, yet it also spread old, incorrect ideas. By the 18th century, the scientific approach championed by figures like John Hunter built directly on Renaissance thinking, turning surgery from a craft into a science.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of aspects of significance. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more aspects of significance.\nExample: The Renaissance was significant because it encouraged observation and questioning of old ideas. Vesalius proved Galen wrong about the jaw bone and blood vessels through dissection. Harvey proved blood circulated in 1628. The printing press spread these findings across Europe, allowing other doctors to check and build on them.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of significance. Students progress from basic explanation by simple reasoning of one identified aspect.\nExample: The Renaissance was significant because it led to new anatomical discoveries. Vesalius performed dissections and published De Humani Corporis Fabrica in 1543, which showed Galen had made mistakes.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of significance. Students identify aspect(s) relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The Renaissance led to new ideas about the body. People started questioning old beliefs.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining the relationship between aspects of significance, for example over time.\nExample: Hunter was significant both for his immediate innovations and his long-term impact on surgery as a profession. His treatment of the popliteal aneurysm by tying off the artery \u2014 rather than amputating \u2014 demonstrated that scientific observation could replace brute-force surgery. More importantly, his teaching methods (using anatomical specimens and hands-on experience) trained a generation of surgeons who spread evidence-based practice. His campaigning helped establish the Royal College of Surgeons in 1800, formalising surgery as a respected profession rather than a barber\u2019s trade.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of aspects of significance. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more aspects of significance.\nExample: Hunter was significant because he changed both surgical techniques and surgical education. He pioneered new techniques like tying off aneurysms instead of amputating, and he collected thousands of anatomical specimens to teach students through direct observation rather than textbooks. His methods helped separate surgery from barbering.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of significance. Students progress from basic explanation by simple reasoning of one identified aspect.\nExample: Hunter was significant because he promoted observation and experiment in surgery. He carried out many dissections and taught his students to learn through hands-on experience rather than relying on old books.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of significance.

        text: "Explain two ways in which ideas about the causes of disease in the medieval period and the early modern period (c.1500\u2013c.1700) were similar.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of similarities. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining complexities of similarities arising from the broader historical context.\nExample: Both periods relied heavily on miasma as an explanation for disease, but the reasons for its persistence differed. In the medieval period, the Church\u2019s control over education meant Galen\u2019s ideas (including miasma) were taught as fact. In the early modern period, miasma persisted because even though the Renaissance encouraged questioning, no one had yet proved what actually caused disease \u2014 without germ theory (not until 1861), miasma remained the best available explanation. Similarly, supernatural beliefs persisted in both periods: medieval people saw plague as God\u2019s punishment, while in the 1600s\u20131700s thousands still attended ceremonies for the King\u2019s Touch.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of similarities. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more identified similarities.\nExample: One similarity is that both periods believed in miasma \u2014 that bad air caused disease. Medieval plague doctors carried posies and early modern people still associated bad smells with illness. Another similarity is that supernatural beliefs remained common in both periods. Medieval flagellants believed God sent plague as punishment, and in the early modern period people still believed in the King\u2019s Touch to cure scrofula.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one similarity. Students progress from basic explanation by reasoning supported with factual knowledge.\nExample: One similarity is that people in both periods still believed in the Four Humours. Medieval and early modern doctors both used bloodletting and purging to try to balance the humours.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of similarity/similarities. Students identify similarity/similarities relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Both periods believed bad air caused disease.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Communication was important throughout but was rarely sufficient on its own \u2014 it needed scientific discoveries to communicate. The printing press (c.1440) allowed Vesalius\u2019s anatomical findings to spread across Europe, but it also spread incorrect ideas like miasma. In the 18th century, Jenner\u2019s publication of his vaccination findings (1798) was crucial, yet without government action (compulsory vaccination in 1852) the impact would have been limited. Koch\u2019s photographs of bacteria were a communication breakthrough that convinced sceptics, but the discoveries they communicated depended on improved microscope technology. In the 20th century, Florey and Chain\u2019s communication of penicillin\u2019s potential to the US government led to mass production, showing how communication and government action interacted.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Communication was important because it allowed medical ideas to spread. The printing press helped Vesalius\u2019s De Humani Corporis Fabrica (1543) reach doctors across Europe. The Royal Society (founded 1660) published scientific journals that helped share new experimental findings. Koch\u2019s photographs of bacteria provided visual proof that convinced sceptics.\nExample (other factor): The role of the individual was also important. Without Jenner\u2019s observation of milkmaids, vaccination would not have been developed. Without Pasteur\u2019s curiosity about why beer spoiled, Germ Theory might have been delayed. Individual genius was needed before there was anything to communicate.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Communication helped medicine develop because new discoveries could be shared. Jenner published his findings about vaccination in 1798 so other doctors could learn how to vaccinate against smallpox.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Communication was important because the printing press spread new ideas.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."

        text: "Has religion been the main factor in the development of medicine in Britain? Explain your answer with reference to religion and other factors. Use a range of examples from across your study of Health and the people: c1000 to the present day.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Religion\u2019s role changed over time from dominant to obstructive. In the medieval period, the Church controlled education and promoted Galen\u2019s ideas as God\u2019s truth, discouraging dissection and slowing anatomical progress. However, it also built hospitals and cared for the sick. During the Renaissance, the Church\u2019s grip weakened: Vesalius performed dissections despite religious taboos. By the 18th century, religious opposition to vaccination (arguing pain was God\u2019s will) delayed acceptance of Jenner\u2019s work and Simpson\u2019s chloroform. Meanwhile, science and technology became increasingly important \u2014 Pasteur\u2019s Germ Theory (1861) and Koch\u2019s bacteriology owed nothing to religion. In the modern period, religion played virtually no role, while government action (NHS 1948) and science (penicillin, DNA) drove progress.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Religion was important in the medieval period because the Church controlled education. It promoted Galen\u2019s ideas, discouraged dissection, and taught that disease was God\u2019s punishment. This slowed medical progress for centuries. However, the Church also built hospitals and monasteries that cared for the sick.\nExample (other factor): Science and technology was more important in the long run. Pasteur\u2019s Germ Theory (1861) and Koch\u2019s identification of specific bacteria completely changed understanding of disease. Improved microscopes allowed scientists to see bacteria for the first time. In the 20th century, Fleming\u2019s discovery of penicillin (1928) saved millions of lives.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Religion slowed medical progress because the Church taught that Galen was always right. This meant people did not challenge old ideas about the Four Humours for hundreds of years.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Religion affected medicine because the Church built hospitals. / Religion stopped new ideas being accepted.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Individuals were essential at every stage, but they could only succeed when other factors aligned. Vesalius needed the printing press to spread his anatomical findings; Harvey\u2019s discovery of blood circulation was only possible because he built on Vesalius\u2019s work. John Hunter\u2019s genius for observation and experiment transformed surgery, but he relied on body-snatchers for specimens because the law did not provide enough bodies. Jenner needed government funding (\u00a330,000 from Parliament) and eventually compulsory legislation (1852) to make vaccination widespread. In the 20th century, Fleming discovered penicillin by chance, but it took Florey and Chain\u2019s persistence and US government mass production during WWII to turn it into a usable drug. Individuals provided the breakthroughs, but science, government, and communication determined their impact.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Individuals were crucial because key breakthroughs depended on specific people. Vesalius challenged Galen through dissection (1543). John Hunter promoted observation and experiment, helping establish surgery as a science. Jenner developed the first vaccine (1796). Pasteur proposed Germ Theory (1861). Without these individuals, medical progress would have stalled.\nExample (other factor): Government action was also vital. Jenner\u2019s vaccine only became widespread when made compulsory in 1852. Chadwick\u2019s campaign for public health led to the 1848 and 1875 Public Health Acts. The NHS (1948) made healthcare available to everyone. Government support was often needed to turn individual discoveries into widespread change.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Individuals were important because John Hunter changed how surgery was practised. He collected thousands of anatomical specimens, pioneered new surgical techniques like treating aneurysms, and helped establish the Royal College of Surgeons in 1800.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Individuals were important because people like Jenner made discoveries. / Government was important because they passed laws about public health.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."
