        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Healthcare Before the NHS</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Before the <dfn class="term" data-def="The National Health Service, established on 5 July 1948, providing free healthcare to all British citizens regardless of their ability to pay.">NHS</dfn> was created in 1948, healthcare in Britain was a patchwork that left millions without proper care. If you were poor, you relied on charity hospitals, <dfn class="term" data-def="Institutions established under the Poor Law to house and provide basic care for those too poor, sick, or old to support themselves.">workhouse</dfn> infirmaries, or simply went without treatment. Seeing a doctor cost money most working-class families could not afford. Hospitals were run by a confusing mix of charities, local councils, and voluntary groups with no national coordination.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Before the NHS, healthcare was based on the <strong>ability to pay</strong>. The wealthy could afford private doctors and hospitals. The middle classes might have insurance. But the poorest &mdash; those who needed healthcare most &mdash; often had no access to it at all. The road to changing this took over fifty years.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Proving the Problem: Booth &amp; Rowntree</h2>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n5">Charles Booth&rsquo;s London Survey (1889&ndash;1903)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n6"><strong>Charles Booth</strong> was a wealthy Liverpool businessman who set out to disprove claims that poverty was widespread in London. Instead, his survey &mdash; begun in <strong>1886</strong>, published as <em>&ldquo;Life and Labour of the People in London&rdquo;</em> from <strong>1889</strong>, and continued until <strong>1903</strong> &mdash; proved the opposite. Booth found that about <strong>30% of Londoners</strong> lived in poverty so extreme they could not afford food or housing. He showed that poverty was caused by factors <strong>beyond individual control</strong> &mdash; low wages, illness, old age, and unemployment &mdash; not by laziness as many Victorians believed.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n7">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Booth created detailed <dfn class="term" data-def="Colour-coded maps of London created by Charles Booth as part of his poverty survey (1889-1903).">poverty maps</dfn> of London, colour-coding every street according to the income and social class of its residents. These maps provided powerful, visual evidence that poverty was concentrated in specific areas and was far more widespread than the government had acknowledged.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n8">Seebohm Rowntree&rsquo;s York Survey (1901)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n9"><strong>Seebohm Rowntree</strong> conducted a similar study in <strong>York</strong> in <strong>1901</strong>, testing whether Booth&rsquo;s London findings applied to a smaller, more typical city. His results were strikingly similar: about <strong>28% of York&rsquo;s population</strong> lived in extreme poverty. Rowntree went further by creating the concept of a <dfn class="term" data-def="The minimum income needed to afford the basic necessities of life &mdash; food, clothing, shelter, and fuel.">&ldquo;poverty line&rdquo;</dfn> &mdash; the minimum income needed for basic necessities. Both Booth and Rowntree set this at <strong>21 shillings per week</strong> (about &pound;1.08). Anyone earning less could not afford food, clothing, or shelter.</p>

A person was most vulnerable as a <strong>child</strong> (parents&rsquo; wages spread thin), then briefly above the poverty line as a <strong>young worker</strong>, then back into poverty with their <strong>own children</strong>, and finally into permanent poverty in <strong>old age</strong>. This showed poverty was a structural problem, not a personal failing.</p>

They proved with <strong>statistical evidence</strong> that poverty was widespread, structural, and caused by factors beyond personal control. Their work put enormous pressure on the government to act.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">The evidence from Booth and Rowntree, combined with a shocking discovery during the <dfn class="term" data-def="A war fought between Britain and the Boer (Dutch-descended) settlers in South Africa from 1899 to 1902.">Boer War</dfn> (1899&ndash;1902), pushed the newly elected <dfn class="term" data-def="The political party that won the 1906 general election in a landslide.">Liberal</dfn> government towards reform. The key figure was <strong>David Lloyd George</strong>, Chancellor of the Exchequer and the main architect of the Liberal welfare programme. He drove through controversial measures including the National Insurance Act, facing strong opposition from the wealthy who resented higher taxes.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n14">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>During the Boer War, army recruiters found that approximately <strong>40% of volunteers</strong> from industrial cities were <strong>too unhealthy to serve</strong> as soldiers. They were underweight, malnourished, riddled with disease, and had rotten teeth. This was a national embarrassment and a security threat &mdash; if Britain could not raise a healthy army, how could it defend its empire? The findings shocked the government so much that in <strong>1904</strong> they set up a special committee on the &ldquo;Physical Deterioration of the People.&rdquo; Its report confirmed the scale of the problem and increased the pressure for reform.</p>

            <h4>School Meals Act</h4>
            <p>Local councils were allowed (and from 1914, required) to provide <strong>free school meals</strong> for the poorest children. By 1914, over 150,000 children were receiving free meals daily. This tackled childhood malnutrition directly.</p>

            <h4>School Medical Inspections</h4>
            <p>All children were to receive <strong>medical inspections</strong> at school. However, initially there was no provision for treatment &mdash; children were told what was wrong with them but given no help to fix it. Free treatment was not available until 1912.</p>

            <h4>Children&rsquo;s Charter</h4>
            <p>The <strong>Children Act</strong> (known as the Children&rsquo;s Charter) banned children from begging and established <strong>juvenile courts</strong> to separate child and adult offenders. However, it did little to address the root causes of child poverty.</p>

            <h4>Old Age Pensions Act</h4>
            <p>For the first time, the government provided a <strong>weekly pension</strong> of 5 shillings (25p) to people over 70 with an income below &pound;31 per year. This helped the elderly avoid the workhouse, though the pension was small and the qualifying age was high (many people did not live to 70). By <strong>1914</strong>, almost <strong>1 million pensioners</strong> were receiving the pension, showing the scale of need.</p>

            <h4>Labour Exchanges</h4>
            <p><strong>Labour Exchanges</strong> were set up in towns across the country to help unemployed people find work. By <strong>1914</strong>, they were finding work for around <strong>3,000 people per day</strong>. However, it was not compulsory for employers to register their job vacancies, which limited their effectiveness.</p>

            <h4>National Insurance Act</h4>
            <p>Workers, employers, and the government all contributed to a fund that provided <strong>sickness pay</strong> (10 shillings per week for 26 weeks) and <strong>free medical care from a panel doctor</strong> for workers earning under &pound;160 per year. However, this did <strong>not</strong> cover workers&rsquo; families, hospital treatment, or specialist care.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n17">The Liberal Reforms had important limitations. The <strong>School Meals Act</strong> was initially voluntary, and many councils refused to implement it &mdash; even where meals were provided, children&rsquo;s health dropped again during holidays. The <strong>Old Age Pension</strong> was means-tested and only for those over 70, when working-class life expectancy was around 50. The <strong>1911 National Insurance Act</strong> only covered the worker, not their wife or children. It did not cover hospital treatment, dentistry, or specialist care, and after <strong>26 weeks</strong>, sickness benefits stopped.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n18">The Liberal Reforms were the <strong>beginning</strong> of the welfare state, not its completion. They showed government <em>could</em> help the poor and sick, but fell far short of healthcare for all. That would take another war and another report.</p>

The shared experience of evacuation, bombing, rationing, and sacrifice created a powerful demand for a fairer Britain after the war. Evacuation revealed urban poverty to middle-class families in the countryside, who were shocked by the condition of children arriving from the cities. The government&rsquo;s wartime control of hospitals also proved a nationally coordinated health system was possible.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The NHS in 1948 was the end of a long road &mdash; from Booth and Rowntree exposing poverty, through the Liberal Reforms&rsquo; first attempts at welfare, to Beveridge&rsquo;s wartime vision meeting post-war determination for a better Britain.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n34">
          <li><strong>Evidence changed attitudes:</strong> Booth and Rowntree&rsquo;s statistical proof that poverty was structural, not personal, overcame the Victorian belief in self-help and laissez-faire.</li>
          <li><strong>War exposed the problem and demanded solutions:</strong> The Boer War revealed the physical cost of poverty (40% of volunteers unfit). World War Two created the mood and political will for comprehensive reform.</li>
          <li><strong>The NHS completed a long journey:</strong> From the limited Liberal Reforms to Beveridge&rsquo;s &ldquo;cradle to grave&rdquo; vision, each step built on the last. The NHS was not a sudden invention but the final piece in fifty years of change.</li>

Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining the relationship between aspects of significance, for example over time.\nExample: The Beveridge Report was significant both immediately and in the longer term. In the short term, it captured the wartime mood for a fairer Britain, selling over 600,000 copies and becoming a key reason Labour won the 1945 election. Its identification of the \u2018Five Giants\u2019 \u2014 Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor, and Idleness \u2014 provided the blueprint for the entire welfare state, including the NHS. In the longer term, Beveridge\u2019s principle of care \u2018from the cradle to the grave\u2019 transformed the relationship between government and citizens, establishing the expectation that the state should provide healthcare, education, and social security. It completed a process begun by Booth and Rowntree\u2019s poverty surveys and the Liberal Reforms, but went far beyond them by proposing comprehensive, universal provision rather than targeted, limited measures.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of aspects of significance. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more aspects of significance.\nExample: The Beveridge Report was significant because it proposed a comprehensive welfare state including a free national health service. It identified five social problems (\u2018giants\u2019) the government needed to tackle. It was also significant because it was hugely popular \u2014 over 600,000 copies sold \u2014 and helped Labour win the 1945 election, leading directly to the creation of the NHS in 1948.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of significance. Students progress from basic explanation by simple reasoning of one identified aspect.\nExample: The Beveridge Report was significant because it recommended a free health service for all citizens. This became the blueprint for the NHS, which was launched in 1948.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of significance. Students identify aspect(s) relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The Beveridge Report was important because it led to the NHS.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining the relationship between aspects of significance, for example over time.\nExample: The Liberal Reforms were significant as the first time the British government accepted responsibility for citizens\u2019 health and welfare, breaking with the laissez-faire tradition. Free school meals (1906), school medical inspections (1907), old age pensions (1908), and the National Insurance Act (1911) addressed specific aspects of poverty identified by Booth and Rowntree. By 1914, almost 1 million pensioners were receiving payments and 150,000 children were getting free school meals daily. However, their longer-term significance lies in what they revealed: the National Insurance Act only covered the worker (not family), lasted only 26 weeks, and excluded hospital care. These gaps proved that partial measures were insufficient, building the case for the comprehensive welfare state proposed by Beveridge in 1942 and delivered through the NHS in 1948.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of aspects of significance. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more aspects of significance.\nExample: The Liberal Reforms were significant because they introduced measures like free school meals, old age pensions, and national insurance for workers. They showed the government could help the poor and sick. They were also significant because their limitations \u2014 the 1911 Act did not cover families or hospital treatment \u2014 proved that more comprehensive reform was needed, setting the stage for the NHS.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of significance. Students progress from basic explanation by simple reasoning of one identified aspect.\nExample: The Liberal Reforms were significant because they were the first time the government tried to help the poor with things like old age pensions and free school meals. This was a big change from the previous attitude of laissez-faire.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of significance. Students identify aspect(s) relevant to the question.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of similarities. Students progress from developed explanation by explaining complexities of similarities arising from the broader historical context.\nExample: Both Booth/Rowntree and Beveridge used evidence and data to expose social problems and pressure the government into action. Booth\u2019s poverty maps of London (1889\u20131903) and Rowntree\u2019s York survey (1901) proved with statistics that ~30% of the population lived in poverty caused by structural factors, not laziness. Similarly, Beveridge\u2019s 1942 report used evidence to identify the \u2018Five Giants\u2019 blocking progress. Both also had a direct and transformative impact on government policy: Booth and Rowntree\u2019s findings pressured the Liberal government into the reforms of 1906\u20131914, while Beveridge\u2019s report became the blueprint for the post-war welfare state including the NHS. In both cases, evidence-based investigation was the catalyst that overcame political resistance to change.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of similarities. Students progress from simple explanation by developed reasoning considering two or more identified similarities.\nExample: Both used detailed evidence to prove that poverty and poor health were widespread. Booth found ~30% of Londoners in poverty and Rowntree found ~28% of York in poverty, while Beveridge identified five major social evils. Both also directly led to major government reforms \u2014 the Liberal Reforms (1906\u20131914) and the welfare state including the NHS (1948).\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one similarity. Students progress from basic explanation by reasoning supported with factual knowledge.\nExample: Both Booth/Rowntree and Beveridge showed that poverty was a serious national problem. Their research put pressure on the government to take action to help people who were poor or sick.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of similarity/similarities. Students identify similarity/similarities relevant to the question. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Both wanted to help poor people and led to government action.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        text: "Has government been the main factor in the development of public health in Britain? Explain your answer with reference to government and other factors. Use a range of examples from across your study of Health and the people: c1000 to the present day.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Government has been essential in public health, but its role has changed over time and has often depended on other factors. In the medieval period, local government attempted basic measures like quarantine during the Black Death (1348), but lacked the scientific understanding to be effective. The 1848 Public Health Act was voluntary and widely ignored. Only after John Snow\u2019s cholera investigation (individual) and the Great Stink (1858) did government act decisively with the 1875 Public Health Act, making clean water and sewage disposal compulsory. The Liberal Reforms (1906\u20131914) \u2014 driven by Booth and Rowntree\u2019s evidence (individuals) and the Boer War (war) \u2014 began direct welfare provision. Beveridge\u2019s report (1942), shaped by WWII\u2019s shared sacrifice (war), led to the NHS in 1948. In the modern era, government campaigns (smoking ban 2007, sugar tax 2018) target lifestyle diseases. Throughout, government action has been most effective when triggered by external factors \u2014 epidemics, war, scientific evidence, or public pressure \u2014 rather than arising independently.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Government has been crucial in public health. The 1875 Public Health Act required local councils to provide clean water, sewers, and sanitation. The Liberal Reforms (1906\u20131914) introduced school meals, pensions, and national insurance. The NHS (1948) provided free healthcare for all. Modern government campaigns like the 2007 smoking ban have reduced lung cancer rates.\nExample (other factor): However, individuals were often the catalyst. Booth and Rowntree\u2019s poverty surveys pressured the government into the Liberal Reforms. John Snow\u2019s investigation of cholera in Broad Street (1854) proved the link to contaminated water before Germ Theory existed. Without these individuals, government might not have acted.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Government has been important in public health because it passed laws to improve conditions. The 1875 Public Health Act made local councils provide clean water and proper sewers. The NHS in 1948 gave everyone free healthcare.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: The government helped public health by creating the NHS.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms. Threshold (1 mark): reasonable accuracy, some control of meaning. 0 marks: errors severely hinder meaning."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: War has been a powerful but intermittent factor in public health. The Boer War (1899\u20131902) exposed the terrible health of the poor \u2014 40% of volunteers were unfit to serve \u2014 triggering the Liberal Reforms (1906\u20131914) including school meals, medical inspections, and national insurance. WWII was even more transformative: shared sacrifice, evacuation revealing urban poverty, and the wartime Emergency Medical Service proving a state health system could work all created the conditions for the Beveridge Report (1942) and the NHS (1948). However, war was not the only factor. Booth and Rowntree\u2019s poverty surveys (1889\u20131903) proved the problem with evidence (communication/individuals). The 1875 Public Health Act was driven by cholera epidemics and the Great Stink, not war. In the modern era, public health campaigns (smoking ban, sugar tax) respond to lifestyle diseases, not conflict. War provided crucial turning points, but government, science, and individuals sustained progress between wars.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): War has been very important. The Boer War revealed that 40% of army volunteers were too unhealthy to fight, leading to the Liberal Reforms. WWII created the demand for the NHS \u2014 the wartime Emergency Medical Service proved a state-run system could work, and the Beveridge Report captured the mood for a fairer post-war Britain.\nExample (other factor): However, science and technology was also important. Pasteur\u2019s Germ Theory (1861) gave the scientific basis for public health reforms. Without understanding that germs caused disease, measures like clean water supply and sewage disposal would not have been introduced.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: War was important because the Boer War showed that many young men were too unhealthy to fight. This led the government to introduce reforms like free school meals and old age pensions to improve the health of the population.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: War helped public health because it showed the government that people were unhealthy.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.

        text: "Has communication been the main factor in the development of medicine in Britain? Explain your answer with reference to communication and other factors. Use a range of examples from across your study of Health and the people: c1000 to the present day.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (13\u201316 marks): Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to sustained judgement. Range of accurate and detailed knowledge. Complex, sustained line of reasoning, sharply focused and fully substantiated. Students progress by analysis of relationship between factors.\nExample: Communication has been a consistent factor across the whole period, though its importance has changed. In the medieval period, communication actually hindered progress \u2014 the Church controlled knowledge, banned dissection, and ensured Galen\u2019s errors were repeated for over 1,000 years. The printing press (c.1440) was a turning point, allowing Vesalius to publish his anatomical drawings widely and challenge Galen. In the modern period, Booth and Rowntree\u2019s published poverty surveys (1889\u20131903) communicated statistical evidence to the public and government, directly leading to the Liberal Reforms. The Beveridge Report (1942) sold 600,000 copies and became a bestseller, shaping public opinion and leading to the NHS. Fleming\u2019s 1929 article on penicillin was ignored for a decade, showing that communication alone is not enough \u2014 Florey and Chain read it in 1938, but the drug still needed war and government funding to be developed. Communication spreads knowledge, but other factors determine whether that knowledge is acted upon.\n\nLevel 3 (9\u201312 marks): Developed explanation of stated factor and other factor(s). Range of accurate knowledge. Developed, sustained line of reasoning. May suggest one factor has greater merit.\nExample (stated factor): Communication has been important throughout. The printing press allowed Vesalius to spread his anatomical discoveries in the Renaissance. Booth and Rowntree published their poverty surveys, which pressured the government into the Liberal Reforms. The Beveridge Report was a bestseller that led to the NHS. Fleming published his penicillin findings in 1929, which Florey and Chain later read and developed.\nExample (other factor): However, science and technology has been more important overall. Without Pasteur\u2019s Germ Theory, Koch\u2019s identification of specific bacteria, or the development of antibiotics, there would have been nothing to communicate. Scientific discoveries drive progress; communication spreads it.\n\nLevel 2 (5\u20138 marks): Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s). Specific knowledge. Simple, sustained line of reasoning.\nExample: Communication was important because it helped spread medical knowledge. The printing press allowed Vesalius to share his anatomical drawings across Europe, and the Beveridge Report was published so widely that it led to the creation of the NHS.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20134 marks): Basic explanation of one or more factors. Basic knowledge.\nExample: Communication helped medicine because people could share their discoveries.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit.\n\nSPaG: High performance (4 marks): consistent accuracy, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms. Intermediate (2\u20133 marks): considerable accuracy, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms.
