      <p>The question gives you two bullet points (e.g. two events, policies, or developments) and asks which had MORE impact. You must write about BOTH bullets, not just one. The examiner wants to see you explain the impact of each and then COMPARE them to reach a judgement.</p>

      <h2>Annotated Model Answer</h2>

      <div class="guide-model-question">
        <p>Which of the following had more impact on the lives of black Americans? &bull; The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955&ndash;56) &bull; The Civil Rights Act (1964). Explain your answer with reference to both bullet points. [12 marks]</p>
      </div>

      <div class="guide-model-paragraph" data-annotation="BULLET A + EVIDENCE">
        <p>The Montgomery Bus Boycott had a significant impact on the lives of black Americans because it was the first successful large-scale protest against segregation in the South. For 381 days, 40,000 black residents of Montgomery refused to use the city buses, costing the bus company 65% of its revenue. The Supreme Court ruled bus segregation unconstitutional in Browder v. Gayle (1956). The boycott proved that non-violent direct action could defeat Jim Crow laws, and it made Martin Luther King Jr. a national leader. However, its direct impact was limited to bus segregation in one city.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="guide-model-paragraph" data-annotation="BULLET B + EVIDENCE">
        <p>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 had a much broader impact because it outlawed racial discrimination across the entire United States. The Act banned segregation in all public places, prohibited employment discrimination based on race, and strengthened voting rights enforcement. It was backed by federal law, meaning businesses and state governments could be taken to court if they discriminated. Within a year, segregation signs came down across the South and black Americans gained legal access to restaurants, hotels, and workplaces that had previously excluded them.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="guide-model-paragraph" data-annotation="COMPARISON + JUDGEMENT">
        <p>Overall, the Civil Rights Act had more impact because it affected every black American in every state, not just bus passengers in Montgomery. The boycott was a crucial catalyst &mdash; without it, the civil rights movement might not have gained momentum &mdash; but its direct impact was narrow. The Civil Rights Act turned the principles of the movement into enforceable law, creating permanent change rather than a single local victory. The boycott inspired the movement, but the Act delivered its results.</p>

            <strong>Only writing about one bullet</strong> &mdash; Both bullets must be covered. Writing brilliantly about one but ignoring the other caps you at Level 1.

            <strong>No comparison or judgement</strong> &mdash; &ldquo;Both had an impact&rdquo; is not a judgement. You must say which had MORE impact and explain WHY, comparing them directly.

            <strong>Describing events without explaining impact</strong> &mdash; The question asks about IMPACT on lives, not what happened. Always connect facts to how people&rsquo;s lives changed.
