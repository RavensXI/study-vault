      <h2>Annotated Model Answer</h2>

      <div class="guide-model-question">
        <p>In what ways were the lives of Americans affected by the economic boom of the 1920s? [8 marks]</p>
      </div>

      <div class="guide-model-paragraph" data-annotation="ECONOMIC IMPACT + EVIDENCE">
        <p>The economic boom of the 1920s transformed the daily lives of many Americans by making consumer goods affordable for the first time. Mass production techniques, pioneered by Henry Ford&rsquo;s assembly line, cut the price of a Model T car from $850 in 1908 to $295 by 1927. By 1929, there were 23 million cars registered in America &mdash; roughly one for every five people. Hire purchase (buying on credit) meant even working-class families could afford radios, refrigerators, and washing machines. These products saved time on housework and connected people to entertainment and news, changing how they spent their leisure time.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="guide-model-paragraph" data-annotation="SOCIAL IMPACT + EVIDENCE">
        <p>The boom also affected social attitudes and opportunities, particularly for women. The prosperity of the 1920s gave young women the financial independence to challenge traditional expectations. &lsquo;Flappers&rsquo; wore shorter skirts, smoked in public, and went out without chaperones &mdash; behaviour that would have been scandalous before the war. The number of women in employment rose by 25% during the 1920s, with many working as secretaries, telephonists, and shop assistants in the growing consumer economy. However, these changes mainly affected white, middle-class women in cities &mdash; rural women and African Americans saw far fewer benefits from the boom.</p>

          <div>
            <strong>Describing the event instead of its effects on lives</strong> &mdash; &ldquo;Ford used assembly lines to make cars&rdquo; is description. You need: &ldquo;Cheaper cars meant families could travel further for work and leisure, transforming daily life.&rdquo;
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="guide-mistake">
          <span class="guide-mistake-icon">&#10060;</span>
          <div>
            <strong>Being too vague about &ldquo;lives&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; &ldquo;People&rsquo;s lives got better&rdquo; scores poorly. Be specific: which people? How exactly did their lives change? Use statistics and examples.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="guide-mistake">
          <span class="guide-mistake-icon">&#10060;</span>

            <strong>Only covering one way</strong> &mdash; Two developed points is the target for Level 4. One point, even if detailed, limits your mark.

        <li class="guide-mistake">
          <span class="guide-mistake-icon">&#10060;</span>
          <div>
            <strong>Ignoring limitations</strong> &mdash; The best answers acknowledge that not everyone was affected equally. A brief mention of who missed out shows sophisticated understanding.
