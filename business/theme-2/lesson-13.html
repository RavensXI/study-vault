        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Types of Data</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Businesses collect and use data to understand how well they are performing. This data falls into two broad categories: <dfn class="term" data-def="Numerical data that can be measured and expressed in numbers, such as sales figures, profit margins, and market share percentages.">quantitative data</dfn> and <dfn class="term" data-def="Non-numerical data based on opinions, views, and experiences, such as customer reviews, interview responses, and feedback forms.">qualitative data</dfn>. Both types are valuable, but they tell the business different things.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n3">Quantitative Data</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Quantitative data is numerical &mdash; it can be measured, counted, and compared. Examples include sales revenue, profit figures, <dfn class="term" data-def="The percentage of total sales in a market that belongs to one business. Calculated as: (business sales &divide; total market sales) &times; 100.">market share</dfn> percentages, customer numbers, and website traffic.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n5">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Objective and factual &mdash; easy to compare over time or against competitors using graphs, tables, and charts</li>
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Can reveal clear trends, such as whether sales are growing or declining</li>
          <li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Tells you <em>what</em> is happening but not <em>why</em> &mdash; numbers alone cannot explain the reasons behind a change</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n6">Qualitative Data</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">Qualitative data is non-numerical &mdash; it captures opinions, feelings, and reasons. Examples include customer reviews, employee feedback, focus group discussions, and interview responses.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n8">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Explains the <em>reasons</em> behind trends &mdash; why customers are leaving, what they like or dislike</li>
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Can uncover problems or opportunities that numbers miss</li>
          <li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Subjective and harder to measure, compare, or analyse &mdash; different people interpret it differently</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n9">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The best decisions use <strong>both</strong> quantitative and qualitative data together. Quantitative data might show that sales have fallen by 15% this quarter. Qualitative data from customer surveys might reveal the reason &mdash; perhaps a competitor launched a better product, or customers are unhappy with delivery times. Combining both gives a clearer picture.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n10">Using Financial Data to Measure Performance</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">Financial data is a key type of quantitative data. Managers use it to assess how well the business is doing and to make decisions about the future.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n12">Comparing Performance Over Time</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">Businesses track figures such as revenue, profit, and profit margins over months or years. This is called <dfn class="term" data-def="Examining data over a period of time to identify patterns, such as rising sales or falling profit margins.">trend analysis</dfn>. For example, a business might compare this year&rsquo;s gross profit margin with last year&rsquo;s to see if it is improving or declining. A falling margin could signal rising costs that need investigating.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n14">Comparing Against Competitors</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">Businesses also compare their financial performance with rivals. If a competitor has a higher net profit margin, it suggests they are managing costs more effectively. Market share data shows whether a business is gaining or losing ground in its industry.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n16">Identifying Trends and Patterns</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">Spotting trends helps managers plan ahead. If sales data shows a clear seasonal pattern &mdash; high in December, low in January &mdash; the business can adjust stock levels, staffing, and marketing spend accordingly. Rising costs over several quarters might prompt a switch to a cheaper supplier.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n18">Greggs, the UK&rsquo;s largest bakery chain, uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative data to drive decisions. Sales data (quantitative) showed that breakfast items were outselling afternoon products, prompting the chain to expand its breakfast menu. Customer feedback (qualitative) revealed demand for healthier options and plant-based products, which led to the launch of the vegan sausage roll in 2019 &mdash; a product that boosted sales by 13.5% in the first half of that year. By combining both types of data, Greggs identified an opportunity that purely financial figures alone would not have revealed.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n19">Limitations of Financial Data</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">While financial data is essential, it has important limitations that managers must be aware of:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n21">
          <li><strong>Backward-looking:</strong> Financial data shows what <em>has already happened</em>. A strong set of accounts does not guarantee future success &mdash; the market could change tomorrow</li>
          <li><strong>Ignores external factors:</strong> Figures do not capture changes in the economy, new competitors entering the market, shifts in consumer taste, or changes in legislation that could affect future performance</li>
          <li><strong>Can be misleading:</strong> Data can be presented selectively to make performance look better than it is. For example, a business might highlight revenue growth while ignoring the fact that profits have fallen because costs rose even faster</li>
          <li><strong>Window dressing:</strong> Some businesses adjust figures legally (for example, by delaying payments or bringing forward sales) to make their accounts look stronger at a particular point in time</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n22">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Financial data is like a rear-view mirror &mdash; it shows where the business has been, not where it is going. A business with excellent profit figures last year could still fail next year if it ignores market changes, rising costs, or shifting customer preferences.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n23">The Value of Data in Decision Making</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">Despite its limitations, data is extremely valuable when used properly. Businesses that make <strong>data-driven decisions</strong> tend to outperform those that rely purely on gut feeling.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n25">
          <li><strong>Reduces risk:</strong> Data gives managers evidence to support their decisions. Launching a new product after positive market research is less risky than guessing what customers might want</li>
          <li><strong>Identifies problems early:</strong> Monitoring financial data regularly helps managers spot falling sales, rising costs, or cash flow problems before they become serious</li>
          <li><strong>Sets realistic targets:</strong> Past performance data helps managers set achievable goals. If sales grew by 5% last year, setting a 50% target would be unrealistic</li>
          <li><strong>Supports communication:</strong> Hard data makes it easier to convince stakeholders &mdash; investors, banks, employees &mdash; that a decision is the right one</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n26">Limitations of All Data</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n27">No data is perfect. Even well-collected data has limitations that managers should consider:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n28">
          <li><strong>Inaccuracy:</strong> Data may contain errors. Sales figures could be recorded incorrectly, or survey respondents might not answer truthfully</li>
          <li><strong>Incompleteness:</strong> Data rarely covers everything. A customer survey might capture the views of 200 people, but that may not represent the business&rsquo;s 50,000 customers</li>
          <li><strong>Bias:</strong> The way questions are worded in surveys, or the way data is collected, can skew results. A business that only surveys its happiest customers will get a misleadingly positive picture</li>
          <li><strong>Out of date:</strong> Data becomes less useful over time. Market research from two years ago may not reflect current consumer preferences</li>
          <li><strong>Experience matters too:</strong> Successful entrepreneurs often combine data with their own experience and instinct. Sometimes gut feeling &mdash; built on years of industry knowledge &mdash; leads to better decisions than data alone</li>
        </ul>

            <span>Case Study: Kodak &mdash; When Data Was Ignored</span>

              <p data-narration-id="n29">Kodak actually invented the first digital camera in 1975, and internal data clearly showed the shift from film to digital photography was accelerating. However, senior managers chose to ignore this data because film sales were still hugely profitable and they did not want to cannibalise their own product. By the time Kodak acted, competitors like Canon and Nikon had captured the digital market. Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2012. This shows that having good data is only useful if managers are willing to act on it &mdash; even when the findings are uncomfortable.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When a question asks you to evaluate data or financial information, always discuss <strong>both its value and its limitations</strong>. A strong answer might say: &ldquo;The profit margin data is useful because it shows the business is becoming more efficient, but it is backward-looking and does not account for a new competitor entering the market next year.&rdquo; Showing you understand that data is helpful but imperfect is what earns top marks.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n31">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Businesses use both quantitative data (numbers) and qualitative data (opinions) to measure performance and guide decisions. Financial data is powerful for spotting trends and comparing performance, but it is always backward-looking and never tells the full story. The best managers combine data with experience and judgement.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>

        marks: "Award up to 3 marks: 1 mark for identification, 1 mark for explanation, 1 mark for development/application.\n\nExample answer:\nQualitative data explains the reasons behind trends shown in quantitative data (1). For example, if sales figures show a 10% decline, customer feedback surveys might reveal that buyers are unhappy with delivery times or product quality (1). This allows the business to take targeted action to fix the specific problem, rather than guessing at the cause and potentially wasting money on the wrong solution (1)."

        marks: "Award up to 3 marks: 1 mark for identification, 1 mark for explanation, 1 mark for development/application.\n\nExample answer:\nData allows managers to identify problems early before they become serious (1). For example, monitoring monthly cash flow data might reveal that the business\u2019s cash balance is falling steadily each month (1). This early warning gives the manager time to arrange an overdraft or cut costs before the business runs out of cash entirely, which could otherwise lead to business failure (1)."

        marks: "Award up to 6 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Detailed discussion with developed reasoning on both sides and a reasoned judgement.\nExample: Financial data is very useful for decision making because it provides objective, measurable evidence. Managers can compare profit margins over time, identify whether costs are rising, and benchmark performance against competitors. This reduces the risk of making decisions based on guesswork. However, financial data alone is not enough. It is backward-looking \u2014 it shows past performance but cannot predict future changes in the market. It also does not explain why performance has changed. A drop in sales could be caused by poor marketing, a new competitor, or changing consumer tastes \u2014 financial data cannot tell you which. Qualitative data, such as customer feedback, is needed to understand the reasons. Additionally, data can be inaccurate or incomplete, and sometimes an entrepreneur\u2019s experience and instinct are just as important. Overall, financial data is essential but should always be combined with qualitative data and managerial judgement to make the best decisions.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about financial data."

The owner has two options: (A) use quantitative sales data to identify which products are underperforming and remove them from the menu, or (B) conduct qualitative customer surveys to find out why customers are buying less.\n\nJustify which option FreshBite should choose.",
        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: Option A \u2014 using sales data to remove underperforming products \u2014 would be quick and easy to implement. The data already exists in the till system, so there is no extra cost. Removing slow-selling sandwiches would reduce waste and allow FreshBite to focus on its best sellers. However, this approach only shows what is happening, not why. The sales drop might not be caused by the menu at all \u2014 it could be due to a new competitor opening nearby, poor customer service, or changed lunch habits since more people work from home. Removing popular items that happen to have temporarily low sales could make things worse. Option B \u2014 customer surveys \u2014 would take more time and effort to organise, and responses are subjective. However, surveys would reveal the actual reasons customers are buying less. If the issue is pricing, a new competitor, or portion sizes, no amount of sales data analysis would uncover that. On balance, FreshBite should choose Option B first. A 20% sales drop is significant and the owner needs to understand the root cause before making changes. Once the surveys reveal why customers are leaving, the owner can then use sales data (Option A) to fine-tune the menu. Ideally, both should be used together.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
