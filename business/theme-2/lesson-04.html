        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">What Does &ldquo;Ethical&rdquo; Mean in Business?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2"><dfn class="term" data-def="Moral principles that guide how a business behaves, going beyond what is legally required to do what is considered right.">Ethics</dfn> in business means doing what is morally right &mdash; not just what is legally required. A business might follow the law but still behave unethically. For example, it is legal to pay workers the minimum wage, but some people would argue it is not ethical if the company is making huge profits while its employees struggle to afford basic living costs.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">Ethical behaviour includes treating workers fairly, being honest with customers, sourcing materials responsibly, and considering the impact of business decisions on the wider community. Many growing businesses face difficult choices about whether to prioritise ethics or profits.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n4">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Ethical decisions go beyond legal compliance. A business can be fully legal but still face public criticism for unethical behaviour &mdash; such as using tax loopholes to avoid paying a fair share, or sourcing products from factories with poor working conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n5">Ethical Trade and Fair Wages</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">Ethical trade means ensuring that the workers who produce goods are treated fairly. This includes paying fair wages, providing safe working conditions, and not using child labour. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A certification system that guarantees producers in developing countries receive a fair price for their goods, along with better working conditions and community investment.">Fairtrade</dfn> mark is one of the most recognised ethical labels. It guarantees that producers in developing countries receive a minimum price for their goods, even if world market prices fall.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">Businesses that adopt ethical trade practices often pay more for their raw materials. A coffee shop using Fairtrade beans will have higher costs than one using the cheapest available supplier. However, many customers are willing to pay a premium for products they know have been sourced responsibly.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n8">The Trade-Off Between Ethics and Profit</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">Ethical choices often increase costs for a business. Paying higher wages, using sustainable materials, or choosing Fairtrade suppliers all eat into profit margins. This creates a trade-off: businesses must decide whether the long-term benefits of ethical behaviour outweigh the short-term cost.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">Arguments that ethics reduce profit:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n11">
          <li><strong>Higher costs</strong> &mdash; Fairtrade ingredients, better wages, and sustainable packaging all cost more than cheaper alternatives</li>
          <li><strong>Lower short-term profit</strong> &mdash; money spent on ethical practices cannot be spent on growth or paid to shareholders</li>
          <li><strong>Competitive disadvantage</strong> &mdash; rivals who cut corners on ethics can offer lower prices</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">Arguments that ethics increase profit in the long run:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n13">
          <li><strong>Brand reputation</strong> &mdash; customers increasingly prefer businesses they trust to act responsibly</li>
          <li><strong>Customer loyalty</strong> &mdash; ethical businesses build stronger relationships with their customers, leading to repeat purchases</li>
          <li><strong>Attracting talent</strong> &mdash; skilled employees often prefer working for companies with strong ethical values</li>
          <li><strong>Premium pricing</strong> &mdash; customers may pay more for ethically sourced products</li>
        </ul>

              <p data-narration-id="n14">The Body Shop was founded by Anita Roddick in 1976 with a clear ethical mission: no animal testing, Fairtrade ingredients, and minimal packaging. At a time when most cosmetics companies tested on animals, The Body Shop stood out. Customers were willing to pay higher prices because they trusted the brand&rsquo;s values. By 2006, the company had over 2,000 stores worldwide and was sold to L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al for &pound;652 million. The Body Shop showed that ethical behaviour can be a powerful <dfn class="term" data-def="A feature or combination of features that makes a business stand out from competitors.">unique selling point</dfn> that drives long-term growth.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n15">Environmental Considerations</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n16">Every business has an impact on the environment. As public awareness of climate change and pollution has grown, businesses face increasing pressure to reduce their environmental footprint. Key environmental issues include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n17">
          <li><strong>Pollution</strong> &mdash; factories and transport release harmful emissions into the air and water</li>
          <li><strong>Waste</strong> &mdash; manufacturing processes create waste that may end up in landfill or the ocean</li>
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="The total amount of greenhouse gases produced by a business, measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalent.">Carbon footprint</dfn></strong> &mdash; the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by a business&rsquo;s activities, including production, transport, and energy use</li>
          <li><strong>Packaging</strong> &mdash; excessive or non-recyclable packaging contributes to waste and pollution</li>
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="Meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In business, it means using resources responsibly.">Sustainability</dfn></strong> &mdash; using resources at a rate that can be maintained long-term, without depleting them for future generations</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n18">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p><dfn class="term" data-def="The idea that businesses have a responsibility to act in the interests of society and the environment, not just their shareholders. Often shortened to CSR.">Corporate social responsibility</dfn> (CSR) is the idea that businesses should consider the interests of society and the environment alongside profit. Many large companies publish annual CSR reports showing how they are reducing waste, cutting emissions, and supporting local communities.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n19">Pressure Groups</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">A <dfn class="term" data-def="An organised group of people who campaign to influence business or government behaviour on a particular issue, such as the environment or animal rights.">pressure group</dfn> is an organisation that campaigns to change the behaviour of businesses or governments. Pressure groups focus on specific issues &mdash; such as the environment, animal welfare, or workers&rsquo; rights &mdash; and use various methods to achieve their aims.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">Methods used by pressure groups include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n22">
          <li><strong>Protests and demonstrations</strong> &mdash; drawing public attention to an issue through marches or blockades</li>
          <li><strong>Social media campaigns</strong> &mdash; using platforms like Twitter/X and Instagram to spread awareness and put pressure on brands</li>
          <li><strong>Boycotts</strong> &mdash; encouraging consumers to stop buying from a business until it changes its behaviour</li>
          <li><strong>Petitions</strong> &mdash; collecting signatures to show widespread public concern</li>
          <li><strong>Lobbying</strong> &mdash; directly contacting politicians and decision-makers to push for new laws or regulations</li>

              <p data-narration-id="n23">In 1995, Greenpeace campaigned against Shell&rsquo;s plan to dump the Brent Spar oil platform in the North Sea. Greenpeace activists occupied the platform, and the campaign generated huge media coverage across Europe. Consumers in Germany boycotted Shell petrol stations, causing sales to drop by up to 50% at some locations. Shell eventually reversed its decision and dismantled the platform on land instead. This case showed the power of pressure groups to change the behaviour of even the largest multinational companies.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n24">The Impact on Business Decisions</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n25">Ethical and environmental considerations affect almost every area of a growing business:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n26">
          <li><strong>Supply chain</strong> &mdash; choosing ethical suppliers may cost more but protects the brand from scandals</li>
          <li><strong>Product design</strong> &mdash; using recyclable materials or reducing packaging adds cost but appeals to environmentally conscious consumers</li>
          <li><strong>Marketing</strong> &mdash; businesses can use their ethical stance as a selling point, but must be genuine &mdash; &ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo; (making false environmental claims) can backfire badly</li>
          <li><strong>Location</strong> &mdash; choosing sites that minimise transport emissions and pollution</li>
          <li><strong>Human resources</strong> &mdash; paying fair wages and offering good working conditions reduces staff turnover and boosts productivity</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n27">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Businesses that ignore ethical and environmental concerns risk losing customers, facing boycotts, and damaging their reputation. In the age of social media, bad practices can go viral in hours. On the other hand, genuinely ethical businesses often find that doing good is also good for business.</p>

        <p>In &ldquo;Discuss&rdquo; and &ldquo;Justify&rdquo; questions about ethics, always consider <strong>both sides</strong> of the argument. Acknowledge that ethical behaviour increases costs, then explain how it can also benefit the business through reputation, loyalty, and premium pricing. Use the specific business from the case study &mdash; do not just write in general terms. The best answers weigh up the trade-off and reach a reasoned judgement.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n33">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Ethics and environmental responsibility are no longer optional for growing businesses. Customers, pressure groups, and governments all expect businesses to act responsibly. While ethical practices increase costs, they can also build brand loyalty, justify premium pricing, and protect against reputational damage.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ethics vs. profit:</strong> Ethical choices cost more in the short term but can strengthen a brand and increase customer loyalty over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Environmental impact:</strong> Businesses must consider pollution, waste, carbon footprint, and sustainability &mdash; or risk backlash from consumers and pressure groups.</li>
          <li><strong>Pressure groups:</strong> Organised campaigns, boycotts, and social media pressure can force even large companies to change their behaviour.</li>

Consumers are increasingly concerned about climate change and may prefer to buy from companies that are seen to be environmentally responsible (1). This can lead to increased customer loyalty and higher sales, which may offset the initial cost of switching to greener energy sources or more efficient transport methods (1)."

If enough customers stop buying from the business, its revenue and profit will fall significantly (1).

It builds brand reputation and customer loyalty \u2014 companies like The Body Shop have shown that ethical values can be a powerful unique selling point. Ethical businesses also find it easier to attract and retain talented employees. However, ethical behaviour almost always increases costs. Paying fair wages, using Fairtrade suppliers, and investing in sustainable processes all reduce short-term profit. In price-sensitive markets, customers may not be willing to pay a premium for ethical products, which puts ethical businesses at a competitive disadvantage against cheaper rivals. Overall, acting ethically is generally good for businesses that sell to consumers who value responsibility, but it may not always be practical for businesses competing mainly on price.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about one side of the argument."

        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: Switching to Fairtrade coffee would directly affect GreenBean\u2019s core product. A 25% increase in ingredient costs is significant for a small chain, and the owner would need to either absorb the cost (reducing profits) or raise prices (risking losing price-sensitive customers). However, the Fairtrade logo is instantly recognisable and could attract ethically minded customers, especially in a competitive coffee market where many independent shops look similar. It is also quick to implement \u2014 no construction or installation needed. Investing \u00a330,000 per branch (\u00a3150,000 total) in solar panels is a large upfront cost that a small chain may struggle to finance. However, solar panels would reduce energy bills every month, eventually paying for themselves. They also visibly signal environmental responsibility and reduce the business\u2019s carbon footprint. The payback period could be 5\u201310 years, so this is a long-term investment. On balance, GreenBean should switch to Fairtrade beans. As a coffee shop, its product is its identity \u2014 Fairtrade certification directly improves the core offer and can be marketed immediately to attract new customers. Solar panels are a good idea but require finance that a small chain with 5 branches may not have, and the benefits take years to materialise.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
