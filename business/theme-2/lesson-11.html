        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Quality Control</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2"><dfn class="term" data-def="A method of checking quality by inspecting finished products at the end of the production process to identify and remove faulty items.">Quality control</dfn> means inspecting products at the <strong>end</strong> of the production process to find and remove any faulty items before they reach the customer. Inspectors check a sample &mdash; or sometimes every single product &mdash; against set standards.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n3">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Simple to set up &mdash; only needs trained inspectors at the end of the production line</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Faults are only spotted after production is complete, so defective items have already used up materials, time, and labour &mdash; creating waste and increasing costs</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Quality control is reactive rather than preventive. If a whole batch is faulty, the business may have to scrap or rework every item, which is expensive and slows down delivery to customers.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n5">Quality Assurance</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n6"><dfn class="term" data-def="A method of maintaining quality by building checks into every stage of the production process, so defects are prevented rather than just detected at the end.">Quality assurance</dfn> takes a different approach. Instead of checking products only at the end, quality checks are built into <strong>every stage</strong> of production. Each worker or team is responsible for the quality of their own work before passing it to the next stage.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">This means defects are caught and fixed early, reducing waste and ensuring a consistently high standard. Workers take more ownership of quality, which can improve motivation.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n8">Total Quality Management (TQM)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n9"><dfn class="term" data-def="A quality assurance approach where every employee in the organisation is responsible for maintaining high standards. Quality becomes part of the business culture, not just a production task.">Total Quality Management (TQM)</dfn> is the most thorough form of quality assurance. It means that <strong>every employee</strong> &mdash; from the factory floor to senior management &mdash; is responsible for quality. Quality is not just a production task; it becomes part of the business culture.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n10">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Reduces waste, improves consistency, and builds a strong reputation for reliability</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Expensive and time-consuming to implement &mdash; requires training for all staff and a genuine culture change</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n11">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Quality control checks products <strong>after</strong> production (detecting faults). Quality assurance checks <strong>during</strong> production (preventing faults). TQM makes quality everyone&rsquo;s responsibility across the whole organisation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n12">The Cost of Poor Quality</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">Selling poor-quality products or delivering a bad experience has serious consequences for a business:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n14">
          <li><strong>Returns and refunds</strong> &mdash; customers send products back, costing the business money and stock</li>
          <li><strong>Bad reviews</strong> &mdash; negative online reviews and social media posts can spread quickly, putting off new customers</li>
          <li><strong>Loss of repeat business</strong> &mdash; unhappy customers will not buy again, reducing long-term revenue</li>
          <li><strong>Damage to brand reputation</strong> &mdash; once a brand is known for poor quality, it is very hard to rebuild trust</li>
          <li><strong>Legal costs</strong> &mdash; if products are unsafe or not fit for purpose, the business may face legal action under the Consumer Rights Act 2015</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n15">Customer Service</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n16"><dfn class="term" data-def="The support and assistance a business provides to customers before, during, and after a purchase to ensure a positive experience.">Customer service</dfn> is the support a business gives to its customers at every stage of the buying process. Good customer service makes people feel valued and builds loyalty.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n17">Before the Sale</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">Before customers buy, businesses can provide helpful <strong>product information</strong>, expert advice, and clear pricing. A well-designed website, knowledgeable staff, and prompt responses to enquiries all help customers make confident purchasing decisions.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n19">During the Sale</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">During the purchase, customers expect <strong>helpful, friendly staff</strong>, easy payment options, and a smooth buying experience &mdash; whether online or in store. Long queues, confusing checkouts, or unhelpful staff can drive customers away.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n21">After the Sale</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n22">After-sale service includes handling <strong>returns and complaints</strong> efficiently, honouring warranties, providing follow-up support, and checking customer satisfaction. A business that resolves complaints well can actually turn a disappointed customer into a loyal one.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n23">Good vs Poor Customer Service</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">The quality of customer service directly affects a business&rsquo;s success:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n25">
          <li><strong>Good customer service</strong> leads to repeat purchases, positive word-of-mouth recommendations, a strong brand reputation, and higher sales revenue</li>
          <li><strong>Poor customer service</strong> leads to lost customers, negative reviews, declining sales, and difficulty attracting new customers &mdash; especially in competitive markets where rivals offer a better experience</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n26">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>It costs a business around five times more to attract a new customer than to keep an existing one. Good customer service is one of the cheapest and most effective ways to build long-term revenue.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n27">The Role of ICT in Customer Service</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n28">Technology has given businesses new ways to communicate with customers and resolve issues quickly:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n29">
          <li><strong>Online chat and chatbots</strong> &mdash; provide instant answers to common questions on the business&rsquo;s website, 24 hours a day</li>
          <li><strong>Social media responses</strong> &mdash; businesses can respond publicly to customer complaints and queries on platforms like X (Twitter), Instagram, and Facebook, showing they care about their customers</li>
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="Customer Relationship Management &mdash; software that stores customer data (purchase history, preferences, complaints) so the business can personalise service and track interactions.">CRM</dfn> systems</strong> &mdash; Customer Relationship Management software stores customer data such as purchase history, preferences, and past complaints, allowing businesses to personalise service and track interactions</li>
          <li><strong>Automated emails</strong> &mdash; order confirmations, delivery updates, and follow-up satisfaction surveys keep customers informed without needing staff to send each message manually</li>
        </ul>

              <p data-narration-id="n30">Amazon built its brand around customer service. The company makes returns simple and fast &mdash; often issuing refunds before the returned item has even arrived back. Its CRM system tracks every purchase and interaction, allowing personalised recommendations. Amazon&rsquo;s customer reviews system means buyers can make informed decisions, and the company actively removes fake reviews to maintain trust. Prime membership offers fast, free delivery as an additional service. This relentless focus on the customer experience is a major reason Amazon became the world&rsquo;s largest online retailer &mdash; customers trust that problems will be resolved quickly and fairly.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When answering questions on quality or customer service, always link your answer back to the <strong>impact on the business</strong>. Do not just describe what quality control or good customer service looks like &mdash; explain how it affects sales, reputation, costs, or repeat business. Use the context of the business in the question to make your answer specific.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n32">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Quality and customer service work together to shape how customers view a business. Getting them right builds loyalty and reputation; getting them wrong is expensive and hard to recover from.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Quality control</strong> inspects finished products; <strong>quality assurance</strong> (including TQM) prevents defects by checking at every stage of production.</li>
          <li><strong>Poor quality</strong> leads to returns, bad reviews, and lost customers &mdash; damaging both revenue and brand reputation.</li>
          <li><strong>Good customer service</strong> before, during, and after the sale builds loyalty, and ICT tools like CRM systems and social media help businesses deliver it efficiently.</li>

Because every employee checks quality at their own stage, defects are caught early before more materials, time, and labour are wasted on a faulty product (1). This lowers the business\u2019s costs of production and means fewer products need to be scrapped or reworked, improving profit margins over time (1)."

This allows the business to personalise its communication and recommend products the customer is likely to want, making the customer feel valued (1). As a result, customers are more likely to remain loyal and make repeat purchases, increasing the business\u2019s long-term revenue (1)."

        marks: "Award up to 6 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Detailed discussion of both methods with developed reasoning and a judgement.\nExample: Quality assurance has clear advantages \u2014 by building checks into every stage of production, defects are caught early. This reduces waste because faulty products are not completed before the problem is found. It also improves consistency, which builds customer trust and strengthens the brand. Workers take more ownership of quality, which can boost motivation. However, quality assurance is more expensive to set up than quality control. It requires training every employee, changing the business culture, and monitoring every production stage. For a very small business with simple products, quality control at the end may be sufficient and far cheaper. There is also a risk that quality assurance slows production if checks at every stage are too detailed. Overall, quality assurance is generally better for businesses producing complex or high-value products where defects are costly. But for simple, low-risk products, quality control may be more cost-effective.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about one or both methods."

        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: Option A would address customer complaints directly. A CRM system would allow FreshBite to track every customer interaction, spot patterns in complaints, and respond to negative reviews on social media quickly and personally. A dedicated customer service team could handle returns, offer replacements, and rebuild trust with unhappy customers. However, this approach treats the symptoms rather than the cause \u2014 customers are complaining because ingredients are missing and deliveries are late. Spending \u00a315,000 on a CRM system will not stop the mistakes from happening. Option B targets the root cause of the problem. Improving quality assurance in the packing process means checks would be built in at every stage \u2014 verifying each ingredient against the order before the box is sealed. This would dramatically reduce missing ingredients, which is the main source of complaints. Fewer errors means fewer returns, fewer negative reviews, and more satisfied customers who order again. On balance, FreshBite should choose Option B. The complaints are caused by operational mistakes, not by a lack of customer service. Fixing the packing process will reduce errors, which will naturally reduce complaints and improve reviews. Once quality is consistent, FreshBite could then consider investing in a CRM system to further strengthen customer relationships \u2014 but the priority must be getting the product right first.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
