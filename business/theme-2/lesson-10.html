        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Procurement</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2"><dfn class="term" data-def="The process of finding, buying, and receiving goods or services from external suppliers.">Procurement</dfn> is the process of finding, buying, and receiving goods or services that a business needs from external suppliers. This could be raw materials for manufacturing, components for assembly, or finished products for resale.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">Effective procurement matters because the inputs a business buys directly affect the quality of its outputs, its costs, and how quickly it can fulfil customer orders. A business that gets procurement wrong &mdash; paying too much, receiving poor-quality materials, or waiting too long for deliveries &mdash; will struggle to compete.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Choosing the Right Supplier</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">Selecting the right supplier is one of the most important decisions a business makes. There are several key factors to consider:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n6">
          <li><strong>Price</strong> &mdash; lower prices reduce costs and improve profit margins, but the cheapest supplier is not always the best choice</li>
          <li><strong>Quality</strong> &mdash; poor-quality materials lead to poor-quality products, more customer complaints, and damage to the brand&rsquo;s reputation</li>
          <li><strong>Reliability</strong> &mdash; can the supplier consistently deliver the right goods, in the right quantities, on time?</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> &mdash; can the supplier respond quickly if the business needs to increase an order at short notice or change a specification?</li>
          <li><strong>Location</strong> &mdash; a nearby supplier means shorter <dfn class="term" data-def="The time between placing an order with a supplier and receiving the goods.">lead times</dfn> and lower delivery costs, but a distant supplier may offer better prices</li>
          <li><strong>Capacity</strong> &mdash; does the supplier have the ability to meet the business&rsquo;s needs as it grows?</li>
          <li><strong>Payment terms</strong> &mdash; generous trade credit (e.g. 60 days to pay) helps the business manage its cash flow</li>
          <li><strong>Ethical standards</strong> &mdash; customers increasingly expect businesses to use suppliers that treat workers fairly and minimise environmental harm</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n7">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>There is often a trade-off between price and quality when choosing suppliers. A business must decide which factors matter most based on its target market and competitive strategy. A luxury brand prioritises quality; a budget retailer prioritises price.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n8">Managing Stock</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">Once a business has chosen its suppliers, it must decide how much <dfn class="term" data-def="The raw materials, components, or finished goods a business holds ready for production or sale.">stock</dfn> to hold. Holding too much stock ties up cash and increases storage costs. Holding too little risks running out and losing sales.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">There are two main approaches to stock management:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n11">
          <li><strong>Just-in-time (JIT)</strong> &mdash; ordering stock only when it is needed for production, keeping stock levels very low. This reduces storage costs and waste but depends on suppliers being extremely reliable.</li>
          <li><strong>Just-in-case (JIC)</strong> &mdash; holding large amounts of stock as a buffer so the business never runs out. This is safer but more expensive, as cash is tied up in inventory that may not sell quickly.</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">Most businesses set a <strong>minimum stock level</strong> &mdash; the lowest amount of stock they are willing to hold before reordering. They also track the <strong>reorder level</strong> (the point at which a new order is placed) and the <strong>lead time</strong> (how long the supplier takes to deliver).</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n13">The Supply Chain</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">The <dfn class="term" data-def="The network of businesses and processes involved in getting a product from raw materials to the final customer.">supply chain</dfn> is the entire network of businesses and processes involved in getting a product from raw materials to the final customer. It includes suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and the transport links between them.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">A reliable supply chain means a business can produce goods consistently and meet customer demand. An unreliable supply chain leads to delays, stock shortages, lost sales, and a damaged reputation.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n16">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Supply chain disruptions can have serious consequences. During the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chains were severely disrupted &mdash; businesses faced shortages of components, long delays, and rapidly rising costs. This showed how dependent modern businesses are on complex, international supply chains.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n17">Supplier Relationships</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">Businesses must decide how to manage their relationships with suppliers. There are two broad approaches:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n19">
          <li><strong>Long-term partnerships</strong> &mdash; building a close, ongoing relationship with a small number of trusted suppliers. This can lead to better prices through bulk discounts, more flexible terms, priority treatment during shortages, and shared innovation. The supplier benefits from guaranteed, regular orders.</li>
          <li><strong>Shopping around</strong> &mdash; regularly switching suppliers to find the cheapest price for each order. This keeps costs down but means the business has no loyalty from suppliers, may receive inconsistent quality, and gets no priority if demand surges.</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">Many businesses use a mix of both approaches &mdash; maintaining long-term partnerships for critical materials while shopping around for less important supplies.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n21">The Role of Logistics</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n22"><dfn class="term" data-def="The management of the flow of goods from the point of origin to the point of consumption, including transport, warehousing, and distribution.">Logistics</dfn> is about getting the right goods to the right place at the right time. It covers transport, warehousing, and distribution &mdash; everything that happens between a product leaving the supplier and reaching the customer.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">Good logistics management helps a business:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n24">
          <li>Reduce delivery times and meet customer expectations</li>
          <li>Minimise transport and storage costs</li>
          <li>Keep stock levels balanced &mdash; enough to meet demand without overstocking</li>
          <li>Respond quickly to changes in demand or supply chain disruptions</li>
        </ul>

              <p data-narration-id="n25">Zara, the Spanish fashion retailer, has built its success on an exceptionally fast supply chain. While most fashion brands take 6&ndash;9 months to get a new design from concept to shop floor, Zara can do it in just 2&ndash;3 weeks. The company keeps much of its manufacturing close to its headquarters in Spain and Portugal rather than outsourcing to Asia. This means shorter lead times and the ability to respond almost instantly to new fashion trends. Zara deliberately produces small batches and restocks frequently, creating a sense of scarcity that encourages customers to buy quickly. The result is less unsold stock, lower markdowns, and a reputation for always having something new in store.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When discussing suppliers in an exam, always link back to the <strong>type of business</strong> in the question. A manufacturer using JIT needs suppliers that are reliable and nearby. A retailer selling luxury goods needs suppliers that deliver high quality. Show the examiner you understand that the &ldquo;best&rdquo; supplier depends on the business&rsquo;s specific needs and strategy.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n27">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Working effectively with suppliers is essential for keeping costs down, maintaining quality, and ensuring products reach customers on time. The right supplier relationships and stock management approach depend on what the business sells and how it competes.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Choosing suppliers</strong> involves balancing price, quality, reliability, flexibility, and ethical standards &mdash; the cheapest option is not always the best.</li>
          <li><strong>Stock management</strong> is a trade-off between holding too much (costly) and too little (risky) &mdash; JIT and JIC represent opposite ends of this spectrum.</li>
          <li><strong>Strong supplier relationships</strong> can provide better prices, priority treatment, and shared innovation, but require commitment from both sides.</li>

For a budget retailer like Poundland, price is the most important factor because customers expect low prices. However, the cheapest supplier may offer lower quality materials. If a business like Apple used cheap components, its products would fail and its premium reputation would be destroyed. Cheap suppliers may also be unreliable \u2014 if deliveries are late, production stops and the business loses sales. There are also ethical concerns \u2014 the cheapest supplier might keep prices low by paying workers poorly or ignoring environmental regulations, which could damage the brand if customers find out. Overall, the cheapest supplier is not always the best choice. The decision depends on the business\u2019s competitive strategy \u2014 a premium brand should prioritise quality and reliability over price.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about one or both sides."

It currently buys from several different suppliers, choosing whoever is cheapest each week. Customer complaints about inconsistent quality have been increasing. The owner is considering two options: (A) sign an exclusive contract with one local farm for all produce, or (B) continue using multiple suppliers but introduce quality checks on every delivery.\n\nJustify which option FreshBox should choose.",
        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: Signing an exclusive contract with one local farm would give FreshBox consistent quality because all produce comes from the same source with known standards. A local farm also means shorter lead times \u2014 fresher fruit and vegetables, which is crucial for a business selling perishable goods. The farm would benefit from guaranteed weekly orders, so it may offer better prices or prioritise FreshBox during busy periods. However, relying on a single supplier is risky \u2014 if the farm has a bad harvest or a supply problem, FreshBox has no backup and would have to let customers down. Continuing with multiple suppliers and adding quality checks would maintain flexibility and reduce the risk of relying on one source. Quality checks would catch problems before produce reaches customers. However, inspecting every delivery is time-consuming and costly for a small business, and the root cause of inconsistent quality \u2014 constantly switching between different suppliers \u2014 is not actually solved. On balance, FreshBox should sign the exclusive contract with the local farm. The business\u2019s USP is fresh, quality produce, and a trusted local supplier delivers this more reliably than constantly switching between the cheapest options. FreshBox could reduce risk by keeping one or two backup suppliers for emergencies, even if the main contract is with one farm.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
