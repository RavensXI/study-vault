        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Gross Profit</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2"><dfn class="term" data-def="The profit a business makes after deducting the direct costs of making or buying the goods it sells, but before deducting other expenses such as rent and wages.">Gross profit</dfn> is the money left over after a business subtracts the direct cost of making or buying its products from its <dfn class="term" data-def="The total income a business receives from selling its goods or services over a given period.">revenue</dfn>. It shows whether the core trading activity is profitable before considering other expenses.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p><strong>Gross Profit = Revenue &minus; Cost of Sales</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n4"><dfn class="term" data-def="The direct costs of producing or purchasing the goods a business sells, including raw materials and stock bought for resale.">Cost of sales</dfn> includes the direct costs of producing or purchasing the goods sold &mdash; raw materials, stock bought for resale, and direct labour on the production line. It does <strong>not</strong> include rent, marketing, or office salaries.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n5"><strong>Worked example:</strong> A clothing business has revenue of &pound;250,000 and cost of sales of &pound;100,000.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n6">
          <li>Gross profit = &pound;250,000 &minus; &pound;100,000 = <strong>&pound;150,000</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">This tells us the business earns &pound;150,000 from its core trading activity. However, it still needs to pay rent, wages, utilities, and other running costs out of this amount.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n8">Net Profit</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n9"><dfn class="term" data-def="The profit remaining after all costs, including operating expenses such as rent, wages, utilities, and marketing, have been deducted from gross profit.">Net profit</dfn> is the profit remaining after <strong>all</strong> business costs have been deducted, not just the cost of sales. It is the true &ldquo;bottom line&rdquo; &mdash; what the business actually keeps.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n10">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p><strong>Net Profit = Gross Profit &minus; Operating Expenses</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n11"><dfn class="term" data-def="The day-to-day costs of running a business that are not directly tied to making the product, such as rent, wages, marketing, insurance, and utility bills.">Operating expenses</dfn> include rent, staff wages, marketing, insurance, utility bills, and any other day-to-day costs not already counted in cost of sales.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n12"><strong>Worked example:</strong> The same clothing business has operating expenses of &pound;110,000.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n13">
          <li>Net profit = &pound;150,000 &minus; &pound;110,000 = <strong>&pound;40,000</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">A business can have a healthy gross profit but a low (or even negative) net profit if its operating expenses are too high. This is why both figures matter.</p>

        <figure class="diagram"><img src="diagram_financial_calculations.jpg" alt="Bar chart showing Revenue at £800k, Cost of Sales deducted to reach Gross Profit at £320k, then Overheads deducted to reach Net Profit at £120k"></figure>


        <h2 data-narration-id="n15">Gross Profit Margin</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n16"><dfn class="term" data-def="The percentage of revenue that is left as gross profit after the cost of sales has been deducted. It measures how efficiently a business turns revenue into profit from its core trading activity.">Gross profit margin</dfn> expresses gross profit as a percentage of revenue. It measures how efficiently a business converts revenue into profit from its core trading activity.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n17">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p><strong>Gross Profit Margin (%) = (Gross Profit &divide; Revenue) &times; 100</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n18"><strong>Worked example:</strong> Using the clothing business figures &mdash; gross profit of &pound;150,000 and revenue of &pound;250,000:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n19">
          <li>Gross profit margin = (&pound;150,000 &divide; &pound;250,000) &times; 100 = <strong>60%</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">This means 60p of every &pound;1 of revenue is left after paying for the goods sold. A high gross profit margin suggests the business is good at controlling its production or purchasing costs. A falling gross profit margin could mean materials have become more expensive or the business has been forced to cut prices.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n21">Net Profit Margin</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n22"><dfn class="term" data-def="The percentage of revenue that remains as net profit after all costs have been deducted. It measures the overall efficiency and profitability of the entire business.">Net profit margin</dfn> expresses net profit as a percentage of revenue. It measures the overall profitability of the business &mdash; how much of each pound of revenue the business actually keeps as profit after <strong>all</strong> costs.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n23">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p><strong>Net Profit Margin (%) = (Net Profit &divide; Revenue) &times; 100</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n24"><strong>Worked example:</strong> Net profit of &pound;40,000 and revenue of &pound;250,000:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n25">
          <li>Net profit margin = (&pound;40,000 &divide; &pound;250,000) &times; 100 = <strong>16%</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n26">The business keeps 16p as profit from every &pound;1 of revenue. If the gross profit margin is healthy but the net profit margin is low, the problem lies in operating expenses rather than production costs. The business might need to cut overheads &mdash; for example, moving to cheaper premises or reducing marketing spend.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n27">Average Rate of Return (ARR)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n28"><dfn class="term" data-def="A method of comparing investment options by calculating the average annual profit as a percentage of the cost of the investment.">Average rate of return (ARR)</dfn> helps a business decide whether an investment is worthwhile. It calculates the average annual profit from an investment as a percentage of the initial cost, making it easy to compare different options.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n29">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p><strong>ARR (%) = (Average Annual Profit &divide; Cost of Investment) &times; 100</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n30">To find average annual profit, calculate the total profit over the life of the investment and divide by the number of years.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n31"><strong>Worked example:</strong> A clothing business invests &pound;80,000 in new machinery. Over 4 years it generates total profit of &pound;48,000.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n32">
          <li>Average annual profit = &pound;48,000 &divide; 4 = <strong>&pound;12,000</strong></li>
          <li>ARR = (&pound;12,000 &divide; &pound;80,000) &times; 100 = <strong>15%</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n33">The higher the ARR, the better the return on investment. A business will usually compare the ARR to other investment options or to the interest rate it could earn by leaving the money in a bank. If the ARR is lower than the bank interest rate, the investment may not be worthwhile.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n34">Interpreting Financial Data</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n35">Financial calculations are only useful if a business can interpret what the numbers mean and take action. Here are the key things to consider:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n36">
          <li><strong>Compare over time</strong> &mdash; is the profit margin improving or declining? A falling margin is a warning sign even if revenue is growing</li>
          <li><strong>Compare against competitors</strong> &mdash; a 10% net profit margin is strong in supermarkets (where margins are typically 2&ndash;5%) but weak in software (where 20%+ is common)</li>
          <li><strong>Look at both margins together</strong> &mdash; a high gross profit margin but low net profit margin suggests operating expenses are the problem, not production costs</li>
          <li><strong>Consider the context</strong> &mdash; a new business may have low margins while it builds a customer base; a seasonal business may have very different margins at different times of year</li>
        </ul>

              <p data-narration-id="n37"><strong>UrbanWear</strong> is a high-street retailer with revenue of &pound;500,000, cost of sales of &pound;300,000, and operating expenses of &pound;160,000. Its gross profit is &pound;200,000 (40% margin) and net profit is &pound;40,000 (8% margin).</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n38"><strong>LuxeThread</strong> is a premium online brand with revenue of &pound;200,000, cost of sales of &pound;60,000, and operating expenses of &pound;70,000. Its gross profit is &pound;140,000 (70% margin) and net profit is &pound;70,000 (35% margin).</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n39">Although UrbanWear has higher revenue, LuxeThread is far more profitable per pound of sales. LuxeThread&rsquo;s higher gross margin comes from premium pricing, and its lower operating expenses (no physical shop, fewer staff) give it a much stronger net profit margin. UrbanWear might improve by cutting overheads or negotiating lower costs with suppliers.</p>

        <p>Always <strong>show your working</strong> in calculation questions &mdash; even if your final answer is wrong, you can still pick up marks for the correct method. When interpreting figures, don&rsquo;t just state the number &mdash; explain what it <strong>means for the business</strong>. For example, &ldquo;a net profit margin of 5% means the business keeps only 5p from every &pound;1 of sales, which suggests its operating costs are too high.&rdquo;</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Financial calculations allow a business to measure profitability, compare performance over time, and make informed investment decisions. Gross and net profit margins reveal different things about business efficiency, and the ARR helps evaluate whether an investment is worth pursuing.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gross profit</strong> measures core trading profitability (Revenue &minus; Cost of sales); <strong>net profit</strong> is the true bottom line after all expenses.</li>
          <li><strong>Profit margins</strong> turn raw figures into percentages for comparison &mdash; a high gross but low net margin points to high operating expenses.</li>
          <li><strong>ARR</strong> compares investment options by expressing average annual profit as a percentage of the initial cost.</li>
        </ul>

The falling net profit margin from 18% to 7% must therefore be caused by rising operating expenses. This could include higher rent if the landlord has increased the lease, increased staffing costs from hiring extra employees or paying higher wages, or a big increase in marketing spending. Utility costs such as electricity for blenders and fridges may also have risen. To improve the net profit margin, FreshFit could try to negotiate lower rent, reduce staff hours during quiet periods, or switch to cheaper marketing methods such as social media instead of paid advertising. However, cutting costs too aggressively could damage customer experience \u2014 for example, reducing staff might lead to longer queues and lost customers. The best approach would be to analyse each operating expense line by line and target the areas where costs have increased most.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about profit margins."

Estimated total profit over 5 years: \u00a318,000.\n\nJustify which investment GreenGlow should choose.",
        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by context.\nExample: Option A has an ARR of 16% (average annual profit \u00a36,400 \u00f7 \u00a340,000 \u00d7 100). Option B has an ARR of 24% (average annual profit \u00a33,600 \u00f7 \u00a315,000 \u00d7 100). Although Option A generates more total profit (\u00a332,000 vs \u00a318,000), Option B delivers a higher return on every pound invested. Option B also requires far less initial investment (\u00a315,000 vs \u00a340,000), which is important for a small business that may not have \u00a340,000 available or may struggle to secure a loan for that amount. The e-commerce website could also open up a national or even international customer base, whereas the automated equipment only speeds up production. However, if GreenGlow is already struggling to meet demand, the equipment could reduce cost of sales and improve the gross profit margin. On balance, GreenGlow should choose Option B. The higher ARR, lower upfront cost, and potential to reach many more customers make it the better use of limited funds. The business could invest in automation later once online sales have grown enough to justify the larger spend.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
