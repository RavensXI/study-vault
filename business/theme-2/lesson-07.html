        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">What Is Promotion?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2"><dfn class="term" data-def="The methods a business uses to communicate with customers and persuade them to buy its products or services.">Promotion</dfn> is how a business communicates with potential customers to make them aware of a product and persuade them to buy it. It is one of the four Ps of the marketing mix, alongside product, price, and place.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">The aims of promotion include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n4">
          <li><strong>Raising awareness</strong> &mdash; making customers know the product exists</li>
          <li><strong>Attracting new customers</strong> &mdash; encouraging people to try the product for the first time</li>
          <li><strong>Increasing sales</strong> &mdash; boosting revenue by persuading more people to buy</li>
          <li><strong>Building brand image</strong> &mdash; creating a positive reputation in customers&rsquo; minds</li>
          <li><strong>Competing with rivals</strong> &mdash; standing out in a crowded market</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n5">Methods of Promotion</h2>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n6">Advertising</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">Advertising is a paid form of promotion where a business pays to have its message shown to a wide audience. Common advertising channels include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n8">
          <li><strong>Television</strong> &mdash; reaches millions of viewers but is very expensive (a 30-second prime-time TV advert can cost over &pound;100,000)</li>
          <li><strong>Radio</strong> &mdash; cheaper than TV and good for reaching local audiences</li>
          <li><strong>Print</strong> &mdash; newspapers, magazines, leaflets, and posters; useful for targeting specific groups</li>
          <li><strong>Online</strong> &mdash; social media ads, search engine ads, and banner ads; highly targeted and measurable</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">Sales Promotions</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">Sales promotions are short-term offers designed to give customers an extra reason to buy now. Examples include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n11">
          <li><strong>BOGOF</strong> (buy one get one free) &mdash; encourages customers to buy more</li>
          <li><strong>Discounts and price reductions</strong> &mdash; a temporary lower price to attract bargain hunters</li>
          <li><strong>Loyalty cards</strong> &mdash; reward repeat customers (e.g. Tesco Clubcard, Costa Coffee rewards)</li>
          <li><strong>Free samples</strong> &mdash; let customers try before they buy, reducing the risk of purchase</li>
          <li><strong>Competitions and prize draws</strong> &mdash; create excitement and engagement around the brand</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n12">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Sales promotions boost sales in the short term, but they reduce profit margins because the business earns less per unit sold. A business that relies too heavily on promotions risks training customers to only buy when there is a deal on.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n13">Sponsorship</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n14"><dfn class="term" data-def="When a business pays to have its name or brand associated with an event, team, or individual in exchange for publicity.">Sponsorship</dfn> is when a business pays to be associated with an event, sports team, or individual. For example, Nike sponsors many top athletes, and Emirates sponsors Arsenal FC. Sponsorship builds brand awareness and creates a positive image by linking the brand with something the target audience cares about.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n15">Public Relations (PR)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n16"><dfn class="term" data-def="Activities aimed at building a positive image of a business in the public eye, such as press releases, charity work, or media appearances.">Public relations</dfn> involves managing the reputation of the business through media coverage, press releases, charity events, and community involvement. Unlike advertising, PR is not directly paid for &mdash; a positive news story about a business is free publicity. However, negative PR (such as a product recall or scandal) can damage a brand quickly.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n17">Social Media Marketing</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">Social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Facebook allow businesses to reach millions of customers for relatively low cost. Benefits include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n19">
          <li>Direct two-way communication with customers</li>
          <li>Highly targeted advertising based on age, location, and interests</li>
          <li>Content can go viral, reaching a huge audience at no extra cost</li>
          <li>Real-time customer feedback and engagement</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n20">Direct Marketing</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">Direct marketing involves communicating with customers individually rather than through mass media. Methods include email newsletters, text messages, catalogues, and personalised offers. It is effective because the message is tailored to the customer, but it can be seen as intrusive if overused.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n22">Factors Affecting the Choice of Promotion</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">A business must choose the right mix of promotional methods. The choice depends on several factors:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n24">
          <li><strong>Budget</strong> &mdash; a small start-up cannot afford TV advertising, so social media or leaflets may be more realistic</li>
          <li><strong>Target audience</strong> &mdash; the promotion must reach the right people. A business targeting teenagers would focus on TikTok and Instagram, not newspaper adverts</li>
          <li><strong>Product type</strong> &mdash; complex or expensive products (like cars) may need personal selling, while everyday items (like snacks) suit TV or social media ads</li>
          <li><strong>Competition</strong> &mdash; if a competitor runs a major advertising campaign, the business may need to respond with its own promotion to avoid losing market share</li>
        </ul>

              <p data-narration-id="n25">Gymshark was founded in 2012 by 19-year-old Ben Francis in his parents&rsquo; garage. Instead of spending on traditional advertising, Gymshark built its brand almost entirely through social media and influencer marketing. The company sent free products to fitness influencers on YouTube and Instagram, who promoted the brand to millions of followers. By 2020, Gymshark was valued at over &pound;1 billion &mdash; all without a single TV advert. This shows how social media marketing can be more effective than traditional advertising, especially for brands targeting younger consumers with limited budgets.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n26">What Is Place?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n27">Place refers to how a product gets from the manufacturer to the customer. It is about choosing the right <dfn class="term" data-def="The route a product takes from the manufacturer to the final consumer, involving intermediaries such as wholesalers and retailers.">distribution channel</dfn> so that products are available where and when customers want to buy them.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n28">Types of Distribution</h3>

        <ul data-narration-id="n29">
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A business that buys goods in bulk from manufacturers and sells them in smaller quantities to retailers.">Wholesaler</dfn></strong> &mdash; buys in bulk from the manufacturer and sells in smaller quantities to retailers. Useful for small retailers who cannot buy directly from the manufacturer.</li>
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A business that sells products directly to the final consumer, such as a shop or supermarket.">Retailer</dfn></strong> &mdash; sells products directly to the consumer. Examples include supermarkets, high-street shops, and department stores.</li>
          <li><strong>E-tailer</strong> &mdash; a retailer that sells online (e.g. Amazon, ASOS). Growing rapidly as more consumers shop online.</li>
          <li><strong>Direct selling</strong> &mdash; the manufacturer sells straight to the consumer with no intermediary. Examples include farm shops, factory outlets, and company websites.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n30">Channels of Distribution</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n31">The main channels of distribution are:</p>

        <div class="timeline" data-narration-id="n32">
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Channel 1</div>
            <h4>Traditional Channel</h4>
            <p>Manufacturer &rarr; Wholesaler &rarr; Retailer &rarr; Consumer. The longest channel, involving the most intermediaries. Each intermediary adds a mark-up, increasing the final price.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Channel 2</div>
            <h4>Modern Channel</h4>
            <p>Manufacturer &rarr; Retailer &rarr; Consumer. Common with large retailers like Tesco and Sainsbury&rsquo;s, which buy directly from manufacturers in bulk, cutting out the wholesaler.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Channel 3</div>
            <h4>Direct Channel</h4>
            <p>Manufacturer &rarr; Consumer. No intermediaries. The manufacturer keeps the full profit margin. Common with online businesses and company websites (e.g. Apple selling through apple.com).</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n33">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The fewer intermediaries in the distribution channel, the more profit the manufacturer keeps. However, intermediaries provide value &mdash; wholesalers break bulk and retailers provide a convenient location for customers to browse and buy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n34">E-commerce and M-commerce</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n35"><dfn class="term" data-def="Buying and selling goods and services over the internet.">E-commerce</dfn> is the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. <dfn class="term" data-def="Buying and selling goods and services through mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.">M-commerce</dfn> (mobile commerce) is e-commerce carried out through smartphones and tablets.

        <h2 data-narration-id="n40">The Integrated Marketing Mix</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n41">Promotion and place do not work in isolation. They must fit together with product and price to create a consistent marketing mix. A luxury product needs premium promotion (high-quality advertising, exclusive events) and selective distribution (specialist retailers, not discount stores). A budget product needs mass-market promotion (TV ads, social media offers) and wide distribution (supermarkets, online retailers).</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n42">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>If the elements of the marketing mix send conflicting messages, customers become confused. A high-end product sold through a discount retailer undermines its premium image. An exclusive brand running constant BOGOF offers cheapens its reputation. Consistency across all four Ps is essential.</p>

The <strong>price</strong> is high (price skimming). <strong>Promotion</strong> uses sleek advertising, high-profile launch events, and word-of-mouth rather than discounts or BOGOF deals. <strong>Place</strong> is carefully controlled &mdash; products are sold through Apple&rsquo;s own stores, its website, and selected premium retailers. Apple never sells through discount chains. Every element reinforces the same message: this is a premium, desirable brand.

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When answering questions about promotion or place, always consider the <strong>type of business</strong> in the case study. A small local bakery has a very different promotional budget and distribution strategy to a national clothing brand. Link your answer to the size of the business, its target market, and its budget &mdash; don&rsquo;t just list generic methods.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n45">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Promotion is how a business communicates with customers, and place is how products reach them. Choosing the right methods for each depends on the business&rsquo;s budget, target audience, and product type. Both must be consistent with the rest of the marketing mix.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Promotion methods</strong> range from advertising and sales promotions to social media and PR &mdash; the right choice depends on budget, audience, and product type.</li>
          <li><strong>Distribution channels</strong> determine how products reach customers &mdash; fewer intermediaries mean more profit for the manufacturer but may limit reach.</li>
          <li><strong>E-commerce</strong> offers 24/7 global access and lower costs, but brings challenges like delivery expenses, returns, and online security.</li>

A small business with a limited budget could run targeted Instagram or TikTok adverts for a few hundred pounds, whereas a single TV advert costs tens of thousands to produce and broadcast (1).

When products are sold through wholesalers and retailers, each one adds their own profit to the price, which either reduces the manufacturer\u2019s share or increases the final price to the consumer (1). By selling directly \u2014 for example through its own website \u2014 the manufacturer can offer competitive prices while still earning more per unit, which improves overall profitability (1)."

The business can reach customers globally and is open 24/7, which increases potential sales. Operating costs are lower because there is no need to pay rent for a high-street location or employ shop-floor staff. Customer data can be used to personalise marketing. However, clothing is a product that customers often want to see, touch, and try on before buying. Return rates for online clothing purchases are very high \u2014 sometimes over 30% \u2014 which is expensive to process and damages profit margins. Physical shops also allow impulse purchases and provide an experience that builds brand loyalty. Overall, e-commerce is not always better \u2014 many successful clothing retailers use both channels. An online presence maximises reach and convenience, while physical shops reduce returns and build customer relationships.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion of advantages and disadvantages with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about e-commerce or physical shops."

        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: Option A \u2014 influencer marketing \u2014 would give GlowUp access to the influencer\u2019s existing audience of beauty-conscious followers. Since GlowUp is a skincare brand targeting young consumers, Instagram and TikTok are exactly where the target market spends time. A single post from a popular influencer could reach hundreds of thousands of potential customers and generate immediate sales through link-in-bio or discount codes. The \u00a34,000 cost also leaves \u00a31,000 in reserve. Option B would reach a smaller, local audience. Printed leaflets are often thrown away, and an exhibition stand only reaches people who attend the event on that day. However, face-to-face contact at an exhibition allows customers to try the products, which builds trust for a new brand. On balance, GlowUp should choose Option A. The brand is new and needs maximum exposure quickly. Skincare is a visual product that performs well on social media, and the target audience of young consumers is far more likely to be influenced by an Instagram post than a printed leaflet. The leftover \u00a31,000 could fund a small exhibition stand later.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
