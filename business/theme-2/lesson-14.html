        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Organisational Structure</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Every business needs a structure that shows who is in charge, who reports to whom, and how decisions are made. An <dfn class="term" data-def="A diagram or system that shows the levels of authority and responsibility within a business, from the most senior managers at the top to the lowest-level employees at the bottom.">hierarchy</dfn> is the system of levels within a business, with the most senior people at the top and the least senior at the bottom. This is usually shown in an organisational chart.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">Two key concepts describe how a hierarchy works:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n4">
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="The order of authority in a business, showing who has the power to make decisions and pass instructions down through the levels of the hierarchy.">Chain of command</dfn></strong> &mdash; the line of authority from the top of the organisation to the bottom. Instructions flow downwards and accountability flows upwards.</li>
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="The number of employees that a manager is directly responsible for supervising. A wide span means many subordinates; a narrow span means few.">Span of control</dfn></strong> &mdash; the number of employees a manager is directly responsible for. A manager with eight people reporting to them has a span of control of eight.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n5">Tall vs Flat Structures</h2>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n6">Tall Structures</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">A tall structure has <strong>many layers</strong> of hierarchy and a <strong>narrow span of control</strong>. Each manager supervises only a small number of employees. Large organisations like the NHS or the army often use tall structures.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n8">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Clear roles and responsibilities &mdash; every employee knows exactly who their line manager is</li>
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Close supervision means tight quality control and fewer mistakes</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Slow communication &mdash; messages must pass through many levels, which can cause delays and distortion</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Expensive &mdash; more managers means higher wage costs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">Flat Structures</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">A flat structure has <strong>few layers</strong> of hierarchy and a <strong>wide span of control</strong>. Each manager oversees a larger number of employees. Start-ups and small businesses often use flat structures.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n11">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Faster communication &mdash; fewer layers mean decisions can be made and shared more quickly</li>
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Employees may feel more empowered and motivated because they have greater responsibility</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Managers can become overloaded with too many subordinates to supervise effectively</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Fewer promotion opportunities, which may reduce motivation for ambitious employees</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n12">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Many businesses have been &ldquo;delayering&rdquo; &mdash; removing layers of middle management to create flatter structures. This cuts costs and speeds up decision-making, but it means remaining managers have a wider span of control.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n13">Centralised vs Decentralised Structures</h2>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n14">Centralised</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">In a <dfn class="term" data-def="An organisational structure where key decisions are made by senior managers at the head office, with little input from lower-level employees or local branches.">centralised</dfn> structure, all important decisions are made by senior managers at the top of the organisation. Local branches or departments follow the instructions they are given.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n16">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Consistent decisions across the whole business &mdash; customers get the same experience everywhere</li>
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Senior managers have an overview of the whole organisation and can coordinate strategy</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Slow to respond to local conditions &mdash; a branch manager cannot react quickly without head office approval</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Lower-level employees may feel demotivated because they have no say in decisions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n17">Decentralised</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">In a <dfn class="term" data-def="An organisational structure where decision-making authority is spread out to local managers and departments, rather than being concentrated at the top.">decentralised</dfn> structure, decision-making is delegated to managers at a local or departmental level. Each branch or team has the authority to make its own choices.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n19">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Faster decisions &mdash; local managers can respond quickly to changes in their market without waiting for head office</li>
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Motivating for employees &mdash; being trusted with decisions increases job satisfaction</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Inconsistency &mdash; different branches may make different decisions, leading to an uneven customer experience</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Local managers may lack the experience or knowledge to make the best strategic decisions</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Case Study: McDonald&rsquo;s &mdash; Centralised but Locally Adapted</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n20">McDonald&rsquo;s uses a largely centralised structure &mdash; the brand, menu, and operational standards are controlled from head office to ensure consistency worldwide. However, it also allows some decentralisation: franchisees in different countries can adapt the menu to local tastes. In India, the McAloo Tikki burger replaced beef options, while in Japan, the Teriyaki McBurger is a best-seller. This blend of centralised control with decentralised flexibility is common in large multinational businesses.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n21">The Recruitment Process</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n22"><dfn class="term" data-def="The process of finding and hiring the right person for a job vacancy within a business.">Recruitment</dfn> is the process of finding and hiring the right person for a job vacancy. Getting it right is essential &mdash; hiring the wrong person wastes time and money, while a strong hire can transform a team.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">The typical recruitment process follows these steps:</p>

        <div class="timeline" data-narration-id="n24">
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Step 1</div>
            <h4>Identify the vacancy</h4>
            <p>The business recognises that a role needs to be filled &mdash; either a new position or a replacement for someone who has left.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Step 2</div>
            <h4>Write a job description &amp; person specification</h4>
            <p>The <dfn class="term" data-def="A document that outlines the duties, responsibilities, and key tasks involved in a particular job role.">job description</dfn> lists the duties and responsibilities of the role. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A document that outlines the qualifications, skills, experience, and personal qualities needed by the ideal candidate for a job.">person specification</dfn> lists the qualifications, skills, and personal qualities the ideal candidate should have.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Step 3</div>
            <h4>Advertise the position</h4>
            <p>The vacancy is advertised internally (within the business) or externally (job websites, social media, newspapers, recruitment agencies).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Step 4</div>
            <h4>Shortlist candidates</h4>
            <p>Applications are reviewed and the strongest candidates are selected for interview based on the person specification.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Step 5</div>
            <h4>Interview &amp; select</h4>
            <p>Shortlisted candidates attend interviews, assessments, or practical tests. The best candidate is chosen.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Step 6</div>
            <h4>Offer the job</h4>
            <p>The successful candidate receives a formal job offer, and the employment contract is agreed.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n25">Internal vs External Recruitment</h2>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n26">Internal Recruitment</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n27">Internal recruitment means filling a vacancy with someone who already works for the business &mdash; through promotion or transfer to a new role.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n28">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Cheaper and faster &mdash; no need to advertise externally or run a lengthy selection process</li>
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> The candidate already knows the business, its culture, and its systems, so they settle in quickly</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Limits the pool of candidates &mdash; a better-qualified person outside the business may be missed</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Creates another vacancy that still needs to be filled</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n29">External Recruitment</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n30">External recruitment means hiring someone from outside the business. This can involve job adverts, recruitment agencies, social media, or headhunting.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n31">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Wider pool of candidates &mdash; more likely to find the best person for the role</li>

          <p>In the exam, the best recruitment method depends on the role. Senior or specialist roles often need external recruitment to find the right expertise. Promotion for lower or mid-level roles rewards loyalty and motivates existing staff.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n33">Types of Employment</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n34">Businesses use different types of employment contracts depending on the role, the work pattern, and the needs of the business:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n35">
          <li><strong>Full-time</strong> &mdash; typically 35&ndash;40 hours per week. The employee is available throughout the working week, making them ideal for core roles. However, full-time staff are more expensive in terms of salary and benefits.</li>
          <li><strong>Part-time</strong> &mdash; fewer hours than full-time (e.g. 15&ndash;20 hours per week). Useful for businesses that need extra cover at peak times, such as evenings or weekends. Lower cost, but may cause communication difficulties if part-time staff miss meetings.</li>
          <li><strong>Permanent</strong> &mdash; an ongoing contract with no set end date. Gives the employee job security and the business a stable workforce, but makes it harder to reduce staff numbers if demand falls.</li>
          <li><strong>Temporary</strong> &mdash; a contract for a fixed period (e.g. six months or to cover maternity leave). Flexible for the business, but temporary workers may be less committed or motivated.</li>
          <li><strong>Freelance / self-employed</strong> &mdash; the worker is hired for a specific project or task and is not a permanent employee. The business avoids paying National Insurance and employee benefits, but has less control over when and how the work is done.</li>
        </ul>

              <p data-narration-id="n36">The growth of app-based platforms like Uber and Deliveroo has created the &ldquo;gig economy&rdquo;, where workers are treated as self-employed and paid per task (or &ldquo;gig&rdquo;) rather than receiving a regular salary. This gives businesses flexibility and lower costs, but workers often lack sick pay, holiday pay, and job security. The gig economy has sparked debate about whether these workers should have more employment rights.</p>

        <p>When answering questions about organisational structure, always link your points to the <strong>size</strong> and <strong>type</strong> of business. A small start-up benefits from a flat, decentralised structure for speed and flexibility. A large multinational like Tesco needs taller, more centralised structures to maintain control and consistency across hundreds of stores.</p>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n38">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Organisational structure determines how a business communicates, makes decisions, and supervises its employees. Recruitment &mdash; whether internal or external &mdash; shapes the skills and culture of the workforce.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tall structures</strong> offer clear authority and close supervision but are slow and costly; <strong>flat structures</strong> are faster and cheaper but risk overloading managers.</li>
          <li><strong>Centralised</strong> structures ensure consistency; <strong>decentralised</strong> structures allow faster local responses and motivate employees.</li>
          <li><strong>Recruitment</strong> involves identifying the vacancy, writing a job description and person specification, advertising, shortlisting, interviewing, and offering the job &mdash; using internal or external methods depending on the role.</li>

An external hire can also bring fresh ideas and new perspectives, which may be vital if the business is struggling and needs a change of direction. However, external recruitment is expensive \u2014 advertising, agency fees, and a lengthy interview process all add cost. There is also a higher risk that the new hire will not fit the company culture. Internal recruitment for senior roles rewards loyalty and motivates other employees by showing that promotion is possible. The candidate already knows the business and can hit the ground running. On balance, external recruitment is not always better. If a strong internal candidate exists, promoting them can be faster, cheaper, and more motivating for the whole workforce. External recruitment is best when the business needs skills or experience that do not exist internally.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about one or both methods."

Two options are being considered: (A) add a layer of middle managers to create a taller structure, or (B) keep the flat structure but hire a senior operations manager to share the CEO\u2019s workload.\n\nJustify which option TechStart should choose.",
        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: Adding a layer of middle managers (Option A) would give the CEO a narrower span of control and allow clearer lines of responsibility. Each middle manager could oversee a team of 3\u20134 developers, providing closer supervision and support. However, for a company with only 12 employees, this could feel overly bureaucratic. It would also significantly increase wage costs at a time when the business may need to invest its revenue in product development. Middle management layers could slow down the fast, flexible decision-making that small tech companies rely on to compete. Hiring a senior operations manager (Option B) keeps the flat structure that has helped TechStart stay agile and innovative. The operations manager could handle day-to-day staff management, recruitment, and admin, freeing the CEO to focus on strategy and product development. This is a single hire rather than multiple managers, so the cost is more manageable. The risk is that one person may still struggle to oversee 12 employees alongside other duties. On balance, Option B is the better choice for TechStart at this stage. With only 12 employees, a full management layer is premature and expensive. A single operations manager solves the CEO\u2019s overload problem while preserving the flat, flexible culture that drives innovation. If the business continues to grow beyond 20\u201325 employees, adding management layers later would then make more sense.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
