        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The Design Mix</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">When a business designs a product, it has to consider three factors at the same time. These three factors are known as the <dfn class="term" data-def="The three elements a business balances when designing a product: function, aesthetics, and cost.">design mix</dfn>: function, aesthetics, and cost. Getting the balance right is essential &mdash; a product that looks good but does not work will fail, and a product that works well but costs too much to make will not be profitable.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n3">Function</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Function means how well the product does its job. A phone must make calls and run apps reliably. A coat must keep the wearer warm and dry. If a product does not perform its basic function, customers will not buy it again and will leave negative reviews that put off other buyers.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n5">Aesthetics</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">Aesthetics refers to how the product looks, feels, and appeals to the senses. This includes shape, colour, texture, and packaging. In many markets &mdash; especially fashion, technology, and food &mdash; aesthetics are a major reason why customers choose one product over another. Apple&rsquo;s products are a well-known example: they function well, but their sleek, minimalist design is a key part of why customers are willing to pay premium prices.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">Cost</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">Cost refers to how much the product costs to manufacture. Businesses must design products that can be made at a cost low enough to sell at a competitive price while still earning a profit. Using cheaper materials or simpler production methods can reduce costs, but this may compromise function or aesthetics.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n9">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The design mix is always a trade-off. A luxury car prioritises aesthetics and function over cost. A budget supermarket&rsquo;s own-brand products prioritise low cost over aesthetics. The right balance depends on the target market and the business&rsquo;s positioning.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n10">The Product Life Cycle</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">Every product goes through a series of stages from the moment it is developed to the point where it is eventually withdrawn from sale. This journey is called the <dfn class="term" data-def="The stages a product passes through from development to decline: development, introduction, growth, maturity, and decline.">product life cycle</dfn>. Understanding these stages helps businesses plan their marketing, pricing, and investment decisions.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n12">1. Development</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">The product is researched, designed, and tested before launch. Sales are zero because the product is not yet on the market. Costs are high due to research and development spending. Many products never make it past this stage &mdash; the idea may prove too expensive to produce or market research may show insufficient demand.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n14">2. Introduction</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">The product is launched onto the market. Sales are low because customers are not yet aware of it. Marketing costs are high as the business promotes the product to build awareness. Cash flow is usually negative at this stage because spending on promotion outweighs the revenue coming in from early sales.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n16">3. Growth</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">Sales rise rapidly as more customers become aware of and start buying the product. The product begins to generate profit as revenue overtakes costs. Competitors may notice the product&rsquo;s success and launch rival versions, so the business may need to invest in further marketing or product improvements to maintain its lead.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n18">4. Maturity</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">Sales reach their peak and then level off. The market is saturated &mdash; most potential customers already own the product or a competitor&rsquo;s version. Profit is at its highest because development costs have been recovered and marketing spending can be reduced. Competition is intense, and businesses may cut prices to hold onto market share.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n20">5. Decline</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">Sales start to fall. This could happen because customer tastes have changed, newer products have replaced it, or the technology has become outdated. The business must decide whether to try to extend the product&rsquo;s life, sell off remaining stock cheaply, or withdraw the product entirely.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n22">Apple&rsquo;s iPod is a textbook example of the product life cycle. It was developed in secret and launched in 2001 (introduction). Sales grew rapidly as digital music replaced CDs (growth), peaking around 2008 with over 50 million units sold per year (maturity). After the iPhone launched in 2007, the iPod entered decline because customers could play music on their phones instead. Apple tried extension strategies &mdash; the iPod Touch, iPod Nano, and iPod Shuffle &mdash; but eventually discontinued the product in 2022.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n23">Extension Strategies</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">When a product enters maturity or begins to decline, a business can use <dfn class="term" data-def="Actions a business takes to extend the life of a product and prevent or delay decline in sales.">extension strategies</dfn> to boost sales and delay the decline stage. The aim is to keep the product profitable for as long as possible.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n25">Common extension strategies include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n26">
          <li><strong>New packaging or design</strong> &mdash; updating the look of the product to make it feel fresh and attract new buyers</li>
          <li><strong>Targeting new markets</strong> &mdash; selling the product to a different customer group or in a new geographical area (e.g. launching in another country)</li>
          <li><strong>Price reductions</strong> &mdash; lowering the price to attract price-sensitive customers who would not have bought at the original price</li>
          <li><strong>New advertising campaigns</strong> &mdash; increasing or changing promotion to remind customers about the product or reach new audiences</li>
          <li><strong>Product updates or improvements</strong> &mdash; adding new features, flavours, or variations to give customers a reason to buy again</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n27">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Coca-Cola is one of the best examples of successful extension strategies. The original recipe has been on sale since 1886, but the company regularly launches new variants (Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Cherry Coke), updates its packaging, and runs major advertising campaigns to keep the brand relevant.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n28">Product Differentiation</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n29"><dfn class="term" data-def="Making a product stand out from competitors through unique features, design, quality, or branding.">Product differentiation</dfn> means making a product different from those offered by competitors. In a crowded market, businesses need a clear reason for customers to choose their product over a rival&rsquo;s.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n30">Ways to differentiate a product include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n31">
          <li><strong>Unique design</strong> &mdash; a distinctive look or shape that is instantly recognisable (e.g. the Dyson bladeless fan)</li>
          <li><strong>Superior features</strong> &mdash; offering functions that competitors do not, such as a longer battery life or extra accessories</li>
          <li><strong>Higher quality</strong> &mdash; using better materials or more careful manufacturing to produce a more durable or reliable product</li>
          <li><strong>Strong branding</strong> &mdash; building an image, reputation, or emotional connection that makes customers loyal (e.g. Nike&rsquo;s &ldquo;Just Do It&rdquo; identity)</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n32">Effective differentiation allows a business to charge higher prices because customers perceive the product as better or more desirable than alternatives. It also helps build brand loyalty, meaning customers come back to buy again rather than switching to a competitor.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n35"><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>

                <li>Research, design, and quality materials increase costs</li>
                <li>Competitors may copy successful features over time</li>
                <li>Customers&rsquo; tastes change, so differentiation must be maintained and updated</li>
                <li>Heavy investment in branding and marketing is needed to communicate the differences</li>

        <p>When a question asks about the product life cycle, always consider <strong>which stage</strong> the product is at before recommending a strategy. A product in growth needs different actions (invest in production, expand distribution) than a product in decline (extension strategies or withdrawal).

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Product design is a balancing act between function, aesthetics, and cost. Every product follows a life cycle from development through to decline, and businesses use extension strategies to keep products profitable for as long as possible.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The design mix</strong> requires businesses to balance function (does it work?), aesthetics (does it look good?), and cost (can we make it affordably?) for their target market.</li>
          <li><strong>The product life cycle</strong> has five stages &mdash; development, introduction, growth, maturity, and decline &mdash; each with different implications for sales, profit, and marketing.</li>
          <li><strong>Product differentiation</strong> helps a business stand out from competitors and can justify higher prices, but it requires ongoing investment.</li>
        </ul>

If customers see the product as unique or better than competitors\u2019 alternatives, they are willing to pay more for it (1).

Coca-Cola has used new variants, updated packaging, and constant advertising campaigns to keep its core product selling for over 130 years. Price reductions can attract new customer groups, and entering new markets can open up entirely new sources of revenue. However, extension strategies do not always work. If the reason for decline is that the technology has become obsolete \u2014 like DVD players being replaced by streaming \u2014 no amount of new packaging or advertising will reverse the trend. Extension strategies also cost money, and if they fail, the business has lost that investment. Overall, extension strategies can delay decline but cannot prevent it forever. Eventually, every product becomes outdated and must be replaced.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about extension strategies."

Sales of its best-selling face wash have been falling for the past year as new competitors have entered the market.

        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: Option A is an extension strategy \u2014 new packaging and advertising could refresh the face wash\u2019s image and attract attention on social media, where teenagers spend a lot of time. At \u00a320,000 it is relatively low cost and low risk. However, if the product is declining because competitors offer genuinely better products, a packaging change alone may not be enough to win customers back. Option B is riskier and four times more expensive, but it targets a completely new market (young adults 18\u201325) where GlowUp has no presence. If successful, it could generate significant new revenue and reduce GlowUp\u2019s dependence on a single declining product. However, developing a premium range requires different expertise, and there is no guarantee that GlowUp\u2019s brand, known for affordable teenage skincare, will appeal to older customers. On balance, GlowUp should choose Option A first because it is much cheaper and addresses the immediate problem of declining sales. If the refreshed product performs well, GlowUp can use the profits to fund Option B later. Investing \u00a380,000 in a new range while the core product is struggling could stretch the business\u2019s finances dangerously thin.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
