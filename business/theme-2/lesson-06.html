        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Price and the Marketing Mix</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Price is one of the four elements of the <dfn class="term" data-def="The combination of product, price, promotion, and place that a business uses to sell its products.">marketing mix</dfn>. It is the amount a customer pays for a product or service. Getting the price right is critical &mdash; too high and customers go elsewhere, too low and the business may not cover its costs or may damage its brand image.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">Price must be consistent with the other three elements of the marketing mix:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n4">
          <li><strong>Product</strong> &mdash; a high-quality, premium product justifies a higher price; a basic product should be priced lower</li>
          <li><strong>Place</strong> &mdash; selling in an upmarket department store suggests a higher price than selling through a discount website</li>
          <li><strong>Promotion</strong> &mdash; advertising that emphasises luxury and exclusivity must match a premium price, not a budget one</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n5">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>If the elements of the marketing mix do not match, customers become confused. A &pound;5 perfume advertised as &ldquo;luxury&rdquo; lacks credibility, and a &pound;200 perfume sold in a pound shop undermines the brand. Price must fit the overall image the business wants to project.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n6">Pricing Strategies</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">A pricing strategy is the approach a business takes when setting the price of its products. Different strategies suit different situations. The five main pricing strategies for GCSE Business are:</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n8">Cost-Plus Pricing</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n9"><dfn class="term" data-def="A pricing method where the selling price is calculated by adding a fixed percentage (markup) to the total cost of producing the product.">Cost-plus pricing</dfn> is the simplest method. The business calculates the total cost of making the product, then adds a percentage on top (the markup) to ensure a profit. For example, if a product costs &pound;10 to make and the business applies a 50% markup, the selling price is &pound;15.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n10">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Simple to calculate and guarantees a profit on every item sold</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Ignores what competitors charge and what customers are willing to pay &mdash; the price may be too high or too low for the market</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n11">Competitive Pricing</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n12"><dfn class="term" data-def="A pricing strategy where a business sets its price at the same level as, or slightly below, its competitors.">Competitive pricing</dfn> means setting the price based on what competitors charge. A business might match the market price or undercut rivals slightly to attract customers. This strategy is common in markets where products are similar, such as petrol stations or supermarkets.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n13">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Keeps the business in line with the market and avoids losing customers to cheaper rivals</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Can lead to price wars where all businesses cut prices, reducing profit margins for everyone</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n14">Penetration Pricing</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n15"><dfn class="term" data-def="A pricing strategy where a business sets a low initial price to attract customers and gain market share quickly, then raises the price once established.">Penetration pricing</dfn> means launching a product at a low price to attract customers quickly and build market share. Once the business has established a loyal customer base, the price is gradually raised. This is often used when entering a competitive market.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n16">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Attracts customers quickly and discourages competitors from entering the market</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> The business makes little or no profit initially, and customers may leave when the price rises</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n17">Price Skimming</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n18"><dfn class="term" data-def="A pricing strategy where a business sets a high initial price for a new or innovative product, then lowers it over time as competitors enter the market.">Price skimming</dfn> is the opposite of penetration pricing. The business launches a new or innovative product at a high price to maximise revenue from early adopters who are willing to pay more. Over time, the price is lowered to attract more price-sensitive customers.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n19">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Maximises profit from customers willing to pay a premium, and helps recover research and development costs quickly</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> The high price may put off many customers and attract competitors who offer cheaper alternatives</li>
        </ul>

            <span>Case Study: Apple and Price Skimming</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n20">Apple is a classic example of price skimming. When a new iPhone launches, it is priced at a premium &mdash; often over &pound;1,000. Early adopters and loyal fans buy it immediately. Within a year, the price drops as newer models are announced and competitors release alternatives. Apple recovers its huge development costs from those early, high-price sales, then captures a wider market as the price falls. The strategy works because Apple&rsquo;s brand loyalty and innovation give it a product that customers feel is worth the premium.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n21">Promotional Pricing</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n22"><dfn class="term" data-def="A short-term pricing strategy where a business temporarily reduces prices to boost sales, such as buy-one-get-one-free offers, seasonal sales, or introductory discounts.">Promotional pricing</dfn> involves temporarily reducing the price to boost sales in the short term. Common examples include buy-one-get-one-free (BOGOF) offers, seasonal sales, loyalty discounts, and introductory offers for new products.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n23">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Creates urgency and encourages customers to buy now; useful for clearing old stock or attracting new customers</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Reduces profit per item and customers may only buy during promotions, waiting for the next sale rather than paying full price</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n24">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Penetration pricing and price skimming are opposite strategies. Penetration starts low and goes up; skimming starts high and comes down. In the exam, make sure you do not confuse them &mdash; think &ldquo;penetrate&rdquo; (break into the market with a low price) versus &ldquo;skim&rdquo; (skim the cream off the top with a high price).</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n25">Factors Affecting Pricing Decisions</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n26">A business does not pick a pricing strategy at random. Several factors influence which strategy is most appropriate:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n27">
          <li><strong>Costs of production</strong> &mdash; the price must cover costs or the business will make a loss. If costs rise (e.g. raw materials become more expensive), prices may need to increase</li>
          <li><strong>Competition</strong> &mdash; in a market with many competitors selling similar products, a business may have little choice but to use competitive pricing. In a market with few competitors, it has more freedom to set higher prices</li>
          <li><strong>Target market</strong> &mdash; luxury brands targeting wealthy customers can charge premium prices. Budget brands targeting price-conscious customers must keep prices low</li>
          <li><strong>Product life cycle stage</strong> &mdash; a brand-new product might use skimming or penetration pricing at launch, then switch to competitive pricing as the market matures</li>
          <li><strong>Brand strength</strong> &mdash; strong brands like Nike or Apple can charge higher prices because customers trust the quality and are willing to pay more. Weaker or unknown brands must compete more on price</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>How the Product Life Cycle Affects Pricing</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n28">Pricing often changes as a product moves through its life cycle:</p>
              <ul data-narration-id="n29">
                <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Price skimming (if the product is innovative) or penetration pricing (if the market is competitive) to build initial sales</li>
                <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Prices may stay stable as demand rises and the business builds brand loyalty</li>
                <li><strong>Maturity:</strong> Competitive pricing becomes important as rivals offer similar products and the market is saturated</li>
                <li><strong>Decline:</strong> Promotional pricing (sales, discounts) to clear remaining stock before the product is discontinued</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n30">Price Sensitivity</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n31">Not all products are equally affected by price changes. Some products are <strong>price sensitive</strong> &mdash; even a small price increase causes a large drop in demand. Others are <strong>price insensitive</strong> &mdash; customers continue to buy even when the price rises significantly.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n32">
          <li><strong>Necessities</strong> (e.g. bread, milk, petrol) tend to be price insensitive &mdash; people need them regardless of price</li>
          <li><strong>Luxuries</strong> (e.g. designer clothes, holidays, eating out) tend to be price sensitive &mdash; customers can do without them, so they shop around for better deals</li>
          <li><strong>Products with many substitutes</strong> are more price sensitive &mdash; if one brand of cola raises its price, customers easily switch to another</li>
          <li><strong>Strongly branded products</strong> are less price sensitive &mdash; loyal Apple customers pay a premium because they value the brand</li>

          <p>Understanding price sensitivity helps a business decide how much flexibility it has when setting prices. A business selling a necessity with few substitutes can raise prices without losing many customers. A business selling a luxury with many alternatives must be much more careful.</p>

        <p>In longer-answer questions, always link your pricing recommendation to the <strong>type of product</strong>, the <strong>target market</strong>, and the <strong>competitive environment</strong> in the case study. Saying &ldquo;they should use penetration pricing&rdquo; without explaining why it suits <em>this</em> business will not reach the top marks. Context is everything.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Pricing is not just about picking a number &mdash; it is a strategic decision that must align with the product, the target market, and the competition. Different strategies suit different situations, and the best choice depends on the business&rsquo;s objectives and market conditions.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Five key strategies:</strong> cost-plus, competitive, penetration, skimming, and promotional pricing each suit different market conditions and business goals.</li>
          <li><strong>Pricing must fit the marketing mix:</strong> the price should be consistent with the product quality, where it is sold, and how it is promoted.</li>
          <li><strong>Context matters:</strong> factors like production costs, competition, brand strength, target market, and product life cycle stage all influence which pricing strategy works best.</li>

This means the business can recover its research and development costs more quickly, since each early sale generates a high profit margin (1). As competitors eventually launch similar products, the business can then lower the price to attract more price-sensitive customers, maintaining sales across the product\u2019s life cycle (1)."

        marks: "Award up to 3 marks: 1 mark for identification, 1 mark for explanation, 1 mark for development/application.\n\nExample answer:\nA strong brand creates customer loyalty (1). Loyal customers trust the quality and reputation of the brand, so they are willing to pay a higher price rather than switching to a cheaper alternative (1). For example, Nike can charge \u00a3120 for trainers that cost far less to produce because customers value the brand image and perceived quality, giving Nike higher profit margins than less well-known competitors (1)."

        marks: "Award up to 6 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Detailed discussion with developed reasoning on both sides and a reasoned judgement.\nExample: Competitive pricing makes sense when customers can easily compare prices and products are similar \u2014 for example, petrol stations or supermarket own-brand goods. If one business charges significantly more, customers simply switch to a rival. However, competitive pricing is not always the best choice. It can lead to price wars that reduce profit margins for all businesses in the market. A business with a strong brand or a unique product might be better off using cost-plus or even premium pricing, because customers value the brand and will pay more. Penetration pricing may be more suitable for a new entrant that needs to build market share quickly. Overall, competitive pricing is a safe option in highly competitive markets with similar products, but it limits a business\u2019s ability to stand out and may not be the most profitable strategy if the business has a genuine point of difference.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about competitive pricing."

        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: Price skimming at \u00a3149.99 would give GlowTech a profit of nearly \u00a3110 per unit on early sales. Since the speaker has features no competitor offers, early adopters and tech enthusiasts will be willing to pay the premium. This would help GlowTech recover its development costs quickly. As competitors eventually release similar products, GlowTech can lower the price to attract a wider market while still maintaining an advantage as the original innovator. Penetration pricing at \u00a359.99 would only generate about \u00a320 profit per unit. While it would attract many customers quickly, this low price is unnecessary when there are no competing products with the same features \u2014 customers have no cheaper alternative to switch to. Furthermore, a low price could damage the product\u2019s image, making it seem cheap rather than innovative. On balance, GlowTech should use price skimming. The product is genuinely innovative with no direct competition, which is the ideal situation for skimming. The high initial price will maximise revenue, build a premium brand image, and the price can always be reduced later as the market evolves.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
