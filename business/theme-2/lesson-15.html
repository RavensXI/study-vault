        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Training</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Training is the process of teaching employees the skills and knowledge they need to do their job effectively. Every business &mdash; from a corner shop to a multinational corporation &mdash; depends on its workforce being properly trained.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n3">On-the-Job Training</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n4"><dfn class="term" data-def="Training that takes place in the workplace while the employee carries out their normal duties, such as shadowing, mentoring, or learning by doing.">On-the-job training</dfn> happens in the workplace while the employee carries out their normal duties. Common methods include shadowing an experienced colleague, being coached by a manager, or simply learning by doing.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n5">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Cheap to deliver because no external courses are needed, and the employee is producing output while they learn</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Quality depends on whoever is doing the teaching &mdash; they may pass on bad habits or lack patience</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n6">Off-the-Job Training</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n7"><dfn class="term" data-def="Training that takes place away from the normal workplace, such as external courses, conferences, college qualifications, or online learning programmes.">Off-the-job training</dfn> takes place away from the normal workplace. This includes external courses, college qualifications, conferences, and online learning programmes run by specialist training providers.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n8">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Taught by specialists, often leads to recognised qualifications, and brings in new ideas from outside the business</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Expensive (course fees, travel, accommodation) and the employee is not working while they train</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n9">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Most businesses use a mix of on-the-job and off-the-job training. New starters often receive on-the-job <dfn class="term" data-def="Initial training given to a new employee to introduce them to the business, its policies, and their role.">induction training</dfn> to learn the basics, then attend off-the-job courses later to develop specialist skills or gain qualifications.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n10">Benefits of Training</h3>

        <ul data-narration-id="n11">
          <li><strong>Improved skills and productivity</strong> &mdash; trained employees work faster and make fewer mistakes</li>
          <li><strong>Better quality</strong> &mdash; staff who understand proper techniques produce higher-quality goods and services</li>
          <li><strong>Staff feel valued</strong> &mdash; investing in employees shows the business cares about their development, which improves loyalty and reduces staff turnover</li>
          <li><strong>Legal compliance</strong> &mdash; some training is legally required, such as health and safety, food hygiene, and data protection</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> &mdash; multi-skilled staff can cover different roles, making the business more adaptable</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n12">Development</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">Development goes beyond training. While training focuses on the skills needed for an employee&rsquo;s current job, development is about the long-term growth of an employee&rsquo;s skills and abilities to prepare them for future roles and responsibilities.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">Examples include leadership programmes, mentoring schemes, secondments to other departments, and supporting employees through professional qualifications. Development benefits the business because it creates a pipeline of capable people ready to step into more senior roles, reducing the cost of external recruitment.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n15">What Is Motivation?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n16"><dfn class="term" data-def="The desire or willingness of an employee to work hard and do their job well.">Motivation</dfn> is the desire and willingness of employees to work hard and perform well. Motivated staff are more productive, produce better quality work, take fewer days off sick, and are less likely to leave the business.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n17">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Low motivation is expensive. It leads to higher absenteeism, higher staff turnover (which means more spending on recruitment and training), lower productivity, and poorer customer service. Businesses that invest in motivation often find the benefits far outweigh the costs.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n18">Financial Methods of Motivation</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">Financial methods use money or monetary rewards to encourage employees to work harder:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n20">
          <li><strong>Salary</strong> &mdash; a fixed annual amount paid monthly, giving employees financial security and stability</li>
          <li><strong>Wages</strong> &mdash; paid per hour or per item produced; can motivate employees to work more hours or produce more</li>
          <li><strong>Bonus</strong> &mdash; a one-off payment for hitting targets or performing well, rewarding extra effort</li>
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A payment made to an employee based on the value or number of sales they make, usually calculated as a percentage of the sale price.">Commission</dfn></strong> &mdash; a percentage of each sale made, common in retail and estate agency; directly rewards selling effort</li>
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A scheme where employees receive a share of the business's profits, usually as an annual payment on top of their normal pay.">Profit sharing</dfn></strong> &mdash; employees receive a share of the company&rsquo;s profits, giving them a direct stake in the business&rsquo;s success</li>
          <li><strong>Fringe benefits</strong> &mdash; non-cash perks such as a company car, private healthcare, gym membership, or staff discounts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n21">Non-Financial Methods of Motivation</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n22">Non-financial methods motivate employees without relying on money. They focus on making work more interesting, fulfilling, and rewarding:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n23">
          <li><strong>Job rotation</strong> &mdash; moving employees between different tasks to reduce boredom and develop a wider range of skills</li>
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="Redesigning a job to include more challenging and meaningful tasks, giving employees greater responsibility and a sense of achievement.">Job enrichment</dfn></strong> &mdash; redesigning a job to include more challenging, meaningful tasks and greater responsibility, making the work more satisfying</li>
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="Giving employees the authority and freedom to make their own decisions about how they do their work.">Empowerment</dfn></strong> &mdash; giving employees the authority to make decisions about their own work, which builds trust and confidence</li>
          <li><strong>Teamwork</strong> &mdash; organising employees into teams so they can support each other and share ideas, creating a sense of belonging</li>
          <li><strong>Recognition</strong> &mdash; praising good work publicly, &ldquo;employee of the month&rdquo; awards, or simply saying thank you &mdash; costs nothing but can be very effective</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n24">Motivation Theories</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n25">Several theorists have tried to explain what motivates people at work. The Edexcel specification focuses on three:</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n26">F.W. Taylor &mdash; Scientific Management</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n27">Taylor believed that workers are primarily motivated by <strong>money</strong>. He argued that managers should break jobs down into small, repetitive tasks and pay workers per item produced (piece rate). Workers who produced more would earn more, so they would work harder. This approach treats employees as an economic resource &mdash; it ignores the fact that people also want interesting work, good relationships, and a sense of purpose.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n28">Abraham Maslow &mdash; Hierarchy of Needs</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n29">Maslow argued that people have five levels of needs, arranged in a hierarchy. Lower-level needs must be met before higher-level needs become motivating:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n30">
          <li><strong>Physiological</strong> &mdash; basic survival needs (food, water, shelter) &mdash; met by earning a wage</li>
          <li><strong>Safety</strong> &mdash; job security, a safe working environment, a contract</li>
          <li><strong>Social</strong> &mdash; belonging, teamwork, friendships at work</li>
          <li><strong>Esteem</strong> &mdash; recognition, respect, promotion, status</li>
          <li><strong>Self-actualisation</strong> &mdash; reaching your full potential, personal growth, creative fulfilment</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n31">According to Maslow, once a need is satisfied it no longer motivates. A well-paid employee with a secure contract will not be further motivated by more money &mdash; they need social belonging, recognition, or opportunities for growth.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n32">Frederick Herzberg &mdash; Two-Factor Theory</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n33">Herzberg identified two types of factors that affect motivation:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n34">
          <li><strong>Hygiene factors</strong> &mdash; things like pay, working conditions, company policy, and job security. If these are poor, employees become dissatisfied. But improving them only removes dissatisfaction &mdash; it does not actively motivate.</li>
          <li><strong>Motivators</strong> &mdash; things like achievement, recognition, responsibility, and interesting work. These are what truly motivate employees to work harder and perform better.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n35">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Herzberg&rsquo;s key insight is that <strong>money alone does not motivate</strong>. Pay is a hygiene factor &mdash; employees expect fair pay, and they will be unhappy without it, but giving someone a pay rise does not make them love their job. Real motivation comes from the work itself: challenge, responsibility, recognition, and growth.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n36">Google is famous for its approach to employee motivation. Staff receive competitive salaries and generous fringe benefits (free meals, on-site gyms, healthcare) &mdash; addressing Herzberg&rsquo;s hygiene factors and Maslow&rsquo;s lower-level needs. But Google also empowers employees with &ldquo;20% time&rdquo; &mdash; allowing them to spend one day a week on personal projects. Gmail and Google Maps both started as 20% time projects. This addresses Maslow&rsquo;s self-actualisation and Herzberg&rsquo;s motivators (achievement, creativity). The result is low staff turnover and high innovation.</p>

        <p>When discussing motivation in the exam, always consider both financial and non-financial methods. A common mistake is assuming that money is always the best motivator. Use the theories to support your answer &mdash; for example, Herzberg would argue that a pay rise only removes dissatisfaction, while job enrichment creates genuine motivation. Always apply your answer to the <strong>specific business</strong> in the case study.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Training, development, and motivation are closely linked. A well-trained workforce is more productive, and employees who feel invested in are more motivated. The best businesses combine financial rewards with non-financial methods to get the most from their people.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Training</strong> can be on-the-job (cheap, practical) or off-the-job (specialist, often leads to qualifications). Most businesses use both.</li>
          <li><strong>Financial methods</strong> (salary, bonus, commission, profit sharing) and <strong>non-financial methods</strong> (job enrichment, empowerment, teamwork) both play a role in motivation.</li>
          <li><strong>Motivation theories:</strong> Taylor said money motivates; Maslow said people have a hierarchy of needs; Herzberg said hygiene factors prevent dissatisfaction but only motivators create real drive.</li>
        </ul>

This makes the work more interesting and gives employees a greater sense of achievement when they complete difficult tasks successfully (1). According to Herzberg, achievement and responsibility are \u2018motivators\u2019 that create genuine satisfaction, so enriched employees are likely to be more committed and less likely to leave, reducing recruitment costs for the business (1)."

Taylor argued that money is the primary motivator, and piece-rate pay can significantly boost output in jobs like factory work or sales. However, Herzberg argued that pay is only a hygiene factor \u2014 it prevents dissatisfaction but does not create lasting motivation. Non-financial methods like job enrichment and empowerment address higher-level needs such as achievement and personal growth. Google\u2019s 20% time policy shows how empowerment can drive innovation without additional pay. Overall, the most effective approach depends on the business and its employees. Low-paid workers may respond best to financial incentives, while skilled professionals may value autonomy and interesting work more highly. The best businesses use a combination of both.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about one or both types."

        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: A 10% pay rise would immediately address any dissatisfaction caused by low pay \u2014 Herzberg would call this fixing a hygiene factor. It may reduce staff turnover in the short term because employees earn more. However, at \u00a3180,000 per year it is three times more expensive than Option B, and Herzberg argues that pay alone does not create lasting motivation. If staff are leaving because the work is boring and repetitive (common in fast food), a pay rise will not fix that. Option B directly addresses the root causes of the problems. Training improves skills, which should reduce customer complaints about service quality. Job enrichment makes work more interesting, addressing Herzberg\u2019s motivators. Team-based working builds social bonds (Maslow\u2019s social needs). Together, these changes should reduce staff turnover more sustainably than a pay rise. On balance, FreshBite should choose Option B. The problems suggest staff are unmotivated by the nature of the work, not just the pay. Option B costs less, tackles the root cause, and creates longer-lasting improvements in both motivation and service quality.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
