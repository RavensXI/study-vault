        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">What Is Globalisation?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2"><dfn class="term" data-def="The increasing interconnection of the world&rsquo;s economies, where businesses, consumers, and governments trade and communicate across national borders.">Globalisation</dfn> is the increasing interconnection of the world&rsquo;s economies. It means that businesses, consumers, and governments are more linked across national borders than ever before.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">Globalisation has been driven by:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n4">
          <li><strong>Improvements in technology</strong> &mdash; the internet and digital communication make it easy to buy, sell, and communicate across the world</li>
          <li><strong>Cheaper transport</strong> &mdash; container shipping and air freight have made it affordable to move goods long distances</li>
          <li><strong>Removal of trade barriers</strong> &mdash; many countries have reduced tariffs and joined trade blocs, making international trade easier</li>
          <li><strong>Growth of multinational companies</strong> &mdash; large businesses now operate in dozens of countries, sourcing materials and selling products globally</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n5">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Globalisation means that a product you buy in the UK may contain raw materials from Africa, be assembled in China, and be designed in the United States. Supply chains now stretch across the entire world.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n6">Imports and Exports</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n7"><dfn class="term" data-def="Goods or services bought from businesses in another country and brought into the home country.">Imports</dfn> are goods or services bought from another country and brought into the UK. <dfn class="term" data-def="Goods or services produced in the home country and sold to customers in another country.">Exports</dfn> are goods or services produced in the UK and sold to customers abroad.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">International trade matters for UK businesses because:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n9">
          <li><strong>Importing</strong> allows businesses to source cheaper raw materials or products that are not available domestically</li>
          <li><strong>Exporting</strong> opens up much larger markets &mdash; a business that only sells in the UK is limited to around 67 million customers, but exporting gives access to billions</li>
          <li>The UK imports more than it exports, meaning the country has a <strong>trade deficit</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n10">Barriers to International Trade</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">Although globalisation has made trade easier, there are still significant barriers that businesses face when trading internationally.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n12">Tariffs</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">A <dfn class="term" data-def="A tax placed on imported goods by a government, making them more expensive and protecting domestic producers from foreign competition.">tariff</dfn> is a tax placed on imported goods by a government. Tariffs make imported products more expensive, which protects domestic businesses from cheaper foreign competition. However, they also raise costs for businesses that rely on imported raw materials.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n14">Trade Blocs</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">A <dfn class="term" data-def="A group of countries that agree to reduce or remove trade barriers between themselves, such as the European Union (EU) single market.">trade bloc</dfn> is a group of countries that agree to reduce or remove trade barriers between themselves. The European Union (EU) single market is a major example &mdash; member countries can trade with each other without tariffs or quotas. However, countries outside the bloc often face higher barriers when trying to sell into it.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n16">Other Barriers</h3>

        <ul data-narration-id="n17">
          <li><strong>Language and cultural differences</strong> &mdash; marketing messages, packaging, and customer service may need to be adapted for different countries</li>
          <li><strong>Legal differences</strong> &mdash; different countries have different laws on product safety, employment, and advertising</li>
          <li><strong>Logistics</strong> &mdash; shipping goods internationally is slower and more complex than domestic delivery</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="collapsible">

            <span>The UK and International Trade After Brexit</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n18">Since leaving the EU single market in 2021, UK businesses face new paperwork and checks when exporting to Europe. Some small businesses have found the extra cost and red tape too expensive and have stopped selling to EU customers. At the same time, the UK has signed new trade deals with countries such as Australia and Japan. The impact of Brexit on UK trade is still unfolding, but it is a clear example of how trade barriers affect businesses.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n19">Exchange Rates</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">The <dfn class="term" data-def="The price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency. For example, &pound;1 = $1.25 means one British pound buys 1.25 US dollars.">exchange rate</dfn> is the price of one currency in terms of another. For example, if &pound;1 = $1.25, then one British pound buys 1.25 US dollars.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">Exchange rates change constantly. These changes have a direct impact on the cost of imports and exports.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n22">Strong Pound</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">When the pound is strong (its value rises against other currencies), each pound buys more foreign currency. This means:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n24">
          <li><strong>Imports become cheaper</strong> &mdash; UK businesses pay less for raw materials and products from abroad</li>
          <li><strong>Exports become more expensive</strong> &mdash; UK goods cost more for foreign customers, which can reduce demand</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n25">Weak Pound</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n26">When the pound is weak (its value falls against other currencies), the opposite happens:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n27">
          <li><strong>Imports become more expensive</strong> &mdash; UK businesses pay more for foreign supplies, raising costs</li>
          <li><strong>Exports become cheaper</strong> &mdash; UK goods are more affordable for foreign buyers, which can boost demand</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n28">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>A simple way to remember: <strong>SPICED</strong> &mdash; Strong Pound, Imports Cheap, Exports Dear. A strong pound helps importers but hurts exporters.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n29">How Businesses Compete Internationally</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n30">To succeed in global markets, UK businesses must find ways to stand out against competitors from all over the world. Key strategies include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n31">
          <li><strong>Product quality</strong> &mdash; producing high-quality goods builds customer loyalty and justifies premium pricing. &ldquo;Made in Britain&rdquo; is associated with quality in many overseas markets.</li>
          <li><strong>Competitive pricing</strong> &mdash; keeping costs low through economies of scale or efficient production allows businesses to price competitively against foreign rivals</li>
          <li><strong>Brand reputation</strong> &mdash; a strong, trusted brand can attract customers even in crowded international markets. Brands like Burberry and Dyson sell worldwide because of their reputation.</li>
          <li><strong>Use of technology</strong> &mdash; e-commerce platforms and social media marketing allow even small UK businesses to reach global customers at low cost</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n32">Impact of Globalisation on UK Businesses</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n33">Globalisation creates both opportunities and threats for UK businesses.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n36"><strong>Economies of scale:</strong> Selling to a global market means higher output, which spreads fixed costs over more units and reduces the cost per unit.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n40">Dyson is a UK-based technology company that designs vacuum cleaners, hand dryers, and haircare products. The company sells in over 80 countries, and around 95% of its revenue comes from outside the UK. Dyson moved its manufacturing to Malaysia to take advantage of lower production costs and to be closer to fast-growing Asian markets. This shows how globalisation allows UK businesses to source, manufacture, and sell internationally &mdash; but it also led to criticism about moving jobs abroad.</p>

        <p>In questions about globalisation, always think about <strong>both sides</strong>. Globalisation creates opportunities (bigger markets, cheaper supplies) but also threats (more competition, exchange rate risk). The best answers explain how these factors affect the <strong>specific business</strong> in the question &mdash; a small local bakery is affected differently from a large multinational like Dyson.</p>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n42">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Globalisation means the world&rsquo;s economies are increasingly connected. UK businesses can sell abroad and source from cheaper suppliers, but they also face tougher competition and exchange rate risks.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Imports and exports</strong> are the foundation of international trade &mdash; importing brings in goods from abroad, exporting sends them out.</li>
          <li><strong>Exchange rates</strong> directly affect costs and revenues &mdash; remember SPICED: Strong Pound, Imports Cheap, Exports Dear.</li>
          <li><strong>Globalisation</strong> creates opportunities (wider markets, cheaper suppliers) and threats (more competition, risk of losing domestic market share).</li>
        </ul>

The business could sell its products internationally through e-commerce websites, reaching customers in Europe, the US, and Asia. This massively increases its potential market. It could also source fabrics from countries like India or China where textile production costs are lower, reducing its cost of production. However, globalisation also creates serious threats. The business now faces competition from large international fast-fashion brands that can produce clothing at a fraction of the cost due to economies of scale and low-wage manufacturing. Exchange rate fluctuations could also increase the cost of imported fabrics unexpectedly. Overall, globalisation is likely a mixed impact \u2014 the small manufacturer may benefit by focusing on a quality niche and using online platforms to reach global customers, but it would struggle to compete on price with large multinational competitors.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about one or both sides."

However, the pound has recently weakened against the euro, and BrightBrew would need to adapt its packaging to meet different labelling laws in each country.\n\nJustify whether BrightBrew should start exporting to Europe.",
        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both sides with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: There are strong arguments for BrightBrew to begin exporting. A weak pound makes UK exports cheaper for European customers, so BrightBrew\u2019s products would be competitively priced against local European tea brands. The European market is much larger than the UK alone, offering significant growth potential. Craft and speciality teas are a growing trend across Europe, so demand is likely to be there. However, there are genuine challenges. Adapting packaging to meet different labelling laws in each country will cost money and take time \u2014 this is especially significant for a small business with limited resources. Since leaving the EU, UK exporters face customs paperwork and potential delays, which add to costs and could frustrate European customers who expect fast delivery. A weak pound also means any raw materials BrightBrew imports (such as tea leaves from India) will be more expensive, squeezing profit margins. On balance, BrightBrew should start exporting but should begin with one or two European countries rather than trying to enter many at once. This limits the cost of adapting packaging while allowing the business to test demand. The weak pound gives a pricing advantage that may not last, so acting now makes sense. Starting small reduces the risk while still taking advantage of the opportunity.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both sides with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both sides."
