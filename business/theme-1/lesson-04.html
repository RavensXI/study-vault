        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">What Is Market Segmentation?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">No business can sell everything to everyone. <dfn class="term" data-def="Dividing a market into distinct groups of customers who share similar characteristics or needs.">Market segmentation</dfn> is the process of dividing a broad market into smaller groups of customers who share similar characteristics. Each group is called a segment. By identifying segments, a business can tailor its products, pricing, and marketing to match what each group actually wants.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">For example, a clothing company does not try to sell the same outfit to teenagers and pensioners. Instead, it designs different ranges for different age groups. That is segmentation in action.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n4">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The purpose of market segmentation is to allow a business to <strong>target its marketing more effectively</strong>. Instead of wasting money on a generic campaign aimed at everyone, the business focuses its resources on the customers most likely to buy. This increases sales and reduces wasted spending.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n5">Ways to Segment a Market</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">There are several ways a business can divide its market into segments. The method chosen depends on the product and the type of customers.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">Demographics</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n8"><dfn class="term" data-def="Statistical characteristics of a population such as age, gender, income, ethnicity, and family size.">Demographics</dfn> are measurable characteristics of a population. Common demographic factors include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n9">
          <li><strong>Age</strong> &mdash; a toy company targets children aged 5&ndash;10; a life insurance firm targets people over 50.</li>
          <li><strong>Gender</strong> &mdash; some products are marketed specifically to men or women, such as fragrances or clothing lines.</li>
          <li><strong>Income</strong> &mdash; luxury brands like Rolex target high-income customers; budget retailers like Primark target price-conscious shoppers.</li>
          <li><strong>Family size</strong> &mdash; a car manufacturer might promote seven-seater vehicles to large families.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n10">Location (Geographic Segmentation)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">Businesses can segment by where customers live. A surf shop in Cornwall targets local coastal residents and tourists. A business selling snow shovels would focus on northern regions. Location also matters at a smaller scale &mdash; a takeaway near a university campus might offer student meal deals, while one in a business district targets office workers at lunchtime.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n12">Lifestyle (Behavioural Segmentation)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">Lifestyle segmentation groups customers by their interests, hobbies, values, and behaviours. A health food company targets fitness-conscious consumers. A gaming company targets people who spend leisure time playing video games. This method looks at <em>how people live</em> rather than who they are on paper.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n14">Income</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">Income is so important it deserves its own focus. It determines what customers can afford and what they are willing to spend. Budget airlines like Ryanair target price-sensitive travellers, while Emirates targets customers who value luxury and are willing to pay a premium. A business that misjudges the income level of its target segment will either price itself out of the market or leave money on the table.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n16">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Most businesses use <strong>more than one method</strong> of segmentation at the same time. A gym might target women (gender) aged 25&ndash;40 (age) who live locally (location) and have an active lifestyle (behaviour). Combining segments creates a more precise picture of the ideal customer.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n17">Market Mapping</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">A <dfn class="term" data-def="A diagram that plots existing products or businesses on a grid using two variables (e.g. price and quality) to identify gaps in the market.">market map</dfn> is a visual tool that helps businesses see where existing products sit in the market. It uses a grid with two axes, each representing a variable such as price, quality, age of target customer, or product range. Existing competitors are plotted on the grid.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">For example, a market map for coffee shops might place price on one axis (low to high) and quality on the other (basic to premium). Plotting competitors like McDonald&rsquo;s (low price, basic), Costa (mid-price, mid-quality), and an independent artisan cafe (high price, premium) reveals where there is space in the market.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n20">How Market Mapping Helps a Business</h3>

        <ul data-narration-id="n21">
          <li><strong>Identifies gaps in the market</strong> &mdash; if no business occupies a particular area on the map, there may be an opportunity. A gap between &ldquo;low price&rdquo; and &ldquo;premium quality&rdquo; might suggest room for an affordable, high-quality option.</li>
          <li><strong>Shows the competition</strong> &mdash; businesses can see exactly who their closest competitors are and how they differ.</li>
          <li><strong>Helps with positioning</strong> &mdash; a new business can decide where it wants to sit on the map and shape its product, price, and marketing accordingly.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n22">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>A gap on a market map does not automatically mean there is a business opportunity. The gap might exist because <strong>there is no demand</strong> in that area. For example, a market map might show a gap for &ldquo;luxury budget hotels&rdquo; &mdash; but that combination is contradictory and unlikely to attract customers. Businesses must combine market mapping with market research to confirm real demand.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n23">The Competitive Environment</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">The <dfn class="term" data-def="The conditions in which businesses compete with each other for customers, including the number and strength of rival firms.">competitive environment</dfn> describes the conditions in which businesses compete for customers. Every business, no matter how unique its product seems, faces competition. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of competitors is essential for survival.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n25">Understanding Competitors</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n26">Businesses assess competitors based on five key factors:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n27">
          <li><strong>Price</strong> &mdash; are competitors cheaper or more expensive? A business needs to know whether it can compete on price or must offer something extra to justify a higher price.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality</strong> &mdash; how does the competitor&rsquo;s product compare? A higher-quality product can command higher prices and build customer loyalty.</li>
          <li><strong>Location</strong> &mdash; is the competitor more conveniently located? A shop next to a train station has a natural advantage over one on a quiet side street.</li>
          <li><strong>Product range</strong> &mdash; does the competitor offer more variety? A wider range means customers can find everything in one place, reducing the need to shop elsewhere.</li>
          <li><strong>Customer service</strong> &mdash; does the competitor provide a better experience? Friendly staff, easy returns, and fast delivery all build <dfn class="term" data-def="The percentage of total sales in a market that is held by one business.">market share</dfn> over time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n28">How Competition Affects Business Decisions</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n29">Competition forces businesses to make better decisions. Without it, there is no pressure to improve. Here is how competition shapes key business decisions:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n30">
          <li><strong>Pricing decisions</strong> &mdash; if a rival drops its prices, a business must decide whether to match the reduction or differentiate through quality and service instead.</li>
          <li><strong>Product development</strong> &mdash; competition drives innovation. When Apple launched the iPhone, competitors rushed to develop their own smartphones. Businesses that fail to keep up lose customers.</li>
          <li><strong>Marketing and promotion</strong> &mdash; in a competitive market, businesses spend more on advertising to stay visible. Supermarkets run loyalty schemes and price-match guarantees specifically to combat competition.</li>
          <li><strong>Customer service improvements</strong> &mdash; businesses invest in staff training, faster delivery, and easier returns to outperform rivals. Amazon&rsquo;s next-day delivery forced other retailers to speed up their own logistics.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n31">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Competition is generally <strong>good for customers</strong> because it leads to lower prices, better quality, and more choice. It is challenging for businesses because it squeezes profit margins and demands constant improvement. Businesses that cannot keep up with competitors risk losing market share and eventually failing.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n32">Spotify is a masterclass in market segmentation within a fiercely competitive environment. When it launched in 2008, the music streaming market was dominated by Apple&rsquo;s iTunes, which sold individual songs and albums. Spotify segmented the market differently: it targeted younger, tech-savvy listeners who wanted unlimited access rather than ownership.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n33">Spotify segments by income with its pricing tiers. The free tier (with adverts) targets price-sensitive users, especially students. Spotify Premium targets customers willing to pay &pound;10.99 a month for ad-free listening. The Family plan targets households. The Student plan offers a discount to 18&ndash;25-year-olds in education. Each tier is designed for a specific segment based on income and lifestyle.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n34">In the competitive environment, Spotify competes with Apple Music, Amazon Music, YouTube Music, and Tidal. It differentiates through its algorithm-driven playlists (like Discover Weekly), its podcast library, and its free tier &mdash; something Apple Music does not offer. By understanding its segments and its competitors&rsquo; weaknesses, Spotify has grown to over 600 million users worldwide.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When answering questions about segmentation, always link the method of segmentation to the specific business in the question. Do not just list types of segmentation &mdash; explain <em>why</em> that method is suitable for that business. A children&rsquo;s toy shop segments by age because its customers are parents buying for specific age groups. Show the examiner you can apply your knowledge to the context.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n36">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Market segmentation and competition are two forces that shape every business decision. Segmentation helps a business focus its limited resources on the customers most likely to buy, while understanding the competitive environment ensures it can hold its own against rival firms.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Segment to focus:</strong> businesses divide the market by demographics, location, lifestyle, and income so they can target their marketing and products at specific groups rather than wasting resources on everyone.</li>
          <li><strong>Map to find gaps:</strong> market maps plot competitors on a grid to reveal opportunities &mdash; but a gap on the map only matters if there is genuine demand to fill it.</li>
          <li><strong>Compete or fall behind:</strong> competition forces businesses to improve their prices, quality, product range, and customer service. Those that ignore competitors lose market share.</li>
        </ul>

If a rival starts offering a similar product at a cheaper price, customers may switch to the competitor to save money (1). As a result, the business must reduce its own prices to stay competitive, even though this may reduce its profit margin \u2014 or it must find another way to differentiate, such as improving quality or customer service (1)."

By plotting existing competitors on a grid based on factors like price and quality, the entrepreneur can see where no business is currently positioned (1).

        marks: "Award up to 6 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Detailed discussion of location and at least one alternative method with developed reasoning and a judgement.\nExample: Location is important because it determines who a business can physically reach. A local bakery in a village will mainly serve people who live nearby \u2014 there is no point marketing to customers 50 miles away. Location also affects product choices: a business in a cold climate might sell more hot drinks than one in a warm area. However, location is not always the most important method. For an online business like ASOS, location is almost irrelevant because it ships nationwide. In that case, demographics (age, gender) and lifestyle are far more useful for targeting the right customers. Income segmentation may also be more important for businesses selling luxury goods, where the customer\u2019s ability to pay matters more than where they live. Overall, the most important method depends on the type of business \u2014 location is critical for physical shops but less important for online retailers.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development of location and/or other methods.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about location or segmentation in general."

She is deciding whether to compete on price by offering lower prices than the chains, or to differentiate by offering premium, locally sourced coffee at a higher price.\n\nJustify which competitive strategy Priya should choose.",
        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: Competing on price would mean Priya charges less than Starbucks and Costa. This could attract price-sensitive customers such as students or people on tight budgets. However, large chains benefit from economies of scale \u2014 they buy coffee beans in bulk at lower cost. Priya, as a small independent, would struggle to match their buying power, so cutting prices would likely squeeze her profit margins to unsustainable levels. She could end up in a price war she cannot win. Differentiating on quality means charging a premium for locally sourced, high-quality coffee. This targets a different market segment \u2014 customers who value taste, ethics, and a unique experience over the cheapest option. Priya could build a loyal customer base by offering something the chains cannot: a personal atmosphere, local suppliers, and speciality blends. A market map would show Starbucks and Costa in the mid-price, standardised-quality area, leaving a gap for a higher-price, premium-quality option. On balance, Priya should differentiate on quality. Competing on price against multinational chains is not sustainable for a small business. By targeting the premium segment, she avoids direct price competition and gives customers a clear reason to choose her over the chains. Her competitive advantage would be quality and experience, not cost.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
