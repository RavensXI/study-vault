        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">What Is a Stakeholder?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">A <dfn class="term" data-def="Any individual or group that has an interest in a business and is affected by its activities.">stakeholder</dfn> is anyone who has an interest in a business and is affected by its decisions. Stakeholders include people inside the business, such as owners and employees, and people outside it, such as customers, suppliers, and the local community.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">Every business has multiple stakeholders. Understanding who they are and what they want is important because their support &mdash; or opposition &mdash; can directly affect whether the business succeeds.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Types of Stakeholders</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">Stakeholders fall into two broad groups:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n6">
          <li><strong>Internal stakeholders</strong> &mdash; people within the business, such as owners, employees, and shareholders</li>
          <li><strong>External stakeholders</strong> &mdash; people outside the business who are still affected by it, such as customers, suppliers, the local community, and the government</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">What Each Stakeholder Wants</h3>

        <div class="timeline" data-narration-id="n8">
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Owners</div>
            <h4>Profit &amp; Growth</h4>
            <p>Owners want the business to make a profit so they earn a return on the money and time they have invested. They also want the business to grow in value over time.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Employees</div>
            <h4>Fair Pay &amp; Job Security</h4>
            <p>Employees want fair wages, good working conditions, job security, and opportunities for promotion. A well-treated workforce is more motivated and productive.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Customers</div>
            <h4>Quality &amp; Value</h4>
            <p>Customers want high-quality products at fair prices, reliable service, and good after-sales support. Satisfied customers return and recommend the business to others.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Suppliers</div>
            <h4>Regular Orders &amp; Payment</h4>
            <p>Suppliers want the business to pay on time and place regular orders. A reliable business relationship benefits both sides.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Local Community</div>
            <h4>Jobs &amp; Minimal Disruption</h4>
            <p>The local community wants the business to create jobs, support the area, and avoid causing problems such as pollution, noise, or traffic congestion.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Government</div>
            <h4>Tax Revenue &amp; Legal Compliance</h4>
            <p>The government wants businesses to pay taxes, follow employment laws, and comply with regulations on health, safety, and the environment.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">Shareholders</div>
            <h4>Dividends &amp; Rising Share Price</h4>
            <p>Shareholders (in limited companies) want a good return on their investment through dividends and an increase in the value of their shares.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n9">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Internal stakeholders (owners, employees, shareholders) are part of the business. External stakeholders (customers, suppliers, local community, government) are outside it but still affected by its decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n10">Stakeholder Conflict</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n11"><dfn class="term" data-def="A situation where different stakeholder groups want different things from a business, making it impossible to satisfy everyone at the same time.">Stakeholder conflict</dfn> happens when the interests of different stakeholder groups clash. Because each group wants something different, it is often impossible for a business to keep everyone happy at the same time.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">Common examples of stakeholder conflict include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n13">
          <li><strong>Owners vs employees</strong> &mdash; owners may want to cut costs to increase profit, but employees want higher wages and better conditions</li>
          <li><strong>Customers vs owners</strong> &mdash; customers want low prices and high quality, but owners want to charge higher prices to maximise profit</li>
          <li><strong>Shareholders vs local community</strong> &mdash; shareholders may push for expansion that increases profits, but the local community may oppose new factories that cause noise and pollution</li>
          <li><strong>Suppliers vs customers</strong> &mdash; suppliers want higher prices for their materials, which pushes up costs and may lead to higher prices for customers</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">Businesses must manage these conflicts carefully. Ignoring one stakeholder group for too long can cause real damage &mdash; unhappy employees leave, dissatisfied customers switch to competitors, and angry communities campaign against the business.</p>

            <span>Case Study: Amazon&rsquo;s Warehouse Workers</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n15">Amazon is one of the world&rsquo;s most profitable companies, but it has faced repeated criticism over working conditions in its warehouses. Customers benefit from fast, cheap delivery, and shareholders benefit from rising profits. However, employees have reported intense pressure to meet targets, limited break times, and high injury rates. The government has investigated these claims, and local communities have sometimes opposed new warehouse developments due to traffic and environmental concerns. This is a clear example of stakeholder conflict &mdash; the interests of customers and shareholders clash with those of employees and the local community.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n16">Technology and Business</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">Technology has transformed the way businesses operate. From selling products online to communicating with customers on social media, digital tools have created new opportunities &mdash; and new challenges &mdash; for businesses of every size.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n18">E-Commerce</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n19"><dfn class="term" data-def="Buying and selling products or services over the internet, for example through a website or app.">E-commerce</dfn> means buying and selling goods or services online. It allows businesses to reach customers far beyond their local area &mdash; even internationally &mdash; without needing a physical shop.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n20">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Open 24/7, wider customer reach, lower overhead costs than a high-street shop</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> High competition online, delivery costs, customers cannot see or try products before buying</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n21">Social Media Marketing</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n22"><dfn class="term" data-def="Using social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook to promote a business, build brand awareness, and engage directly with customers.">Social media marketing</dfn> uses platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook to promote products, build brand awareness, and interact directly with customers. It is much cheaper than traditional advertising such as TV or newspaper adverts.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n23">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Low cost, highly targeted (businesses can reach specific age groups, locations, or interests), builds customer loyalty through direct engagement</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Negative reviews and complaints spread quickly; requires constant content creation to stay visible</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n24">Digital Communication</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n25">Tools like email, video calls, and instant messaging have made business communication faster and cheaper. Teams can collaborate from different locations, and businesses can respond to customer enquiries almost instantly.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n26">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Reduces travel costs, speeds up decision-making, enables remote working</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Can lead to information overload; less personal than face-to-face meetings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n27">Automation</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n28"><dfn class="term" data-def="Using machines, robots, or software to carry out tasks that were previously done by people, often to reduce costs and increase speed or accuracy.">Automation</dfn> means using machines, robots, or software to carry out tasks that were previously done by people. In manufacturing, robots assemble products faster and more accurately. In offices, software can handle repetitive tasks like invoicing and data entry.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n29">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Reduces labour costs, increases speed and consistency, fewer human errors</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> High initial cost of equipment; can lead to job losses, creating conflict with employees and the local community</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n30">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Technology can create stakeholder conflict. For example, <strong>automation</strong> benefits owners (lower costs, higher profits) but can harm employees (job losses) and the local community (fewer local jobs). Businesses must weigh up these trade-offs when adopting new technology.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n31">Impact of Technology on Business</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n32">Technology affects almost every area of business activity:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n33">
          <li><strong>Sales</strong> &mdash; e-commerce and mobile apps allow businesses to sell to a global market around the clock, increasing revenue potential</li>
          <li><strong>Costs</strong> &mdash; automation and cloud computing can reduce long-term costs by replacing manual labour and expensive physical infrastructure</li>

              <p data-narration-id="n34">Gymshark started in 2012 as a small e-commerce business selling fitness clothing from a garage in Birmingham. Instead of spending money on traditional advertising, the founder Ben Francis used social media marketing &mdash; partnering with fitness influencers on Instagram and YouTube to promote the brand. This approach cost a fraction of what TV advertising would have cost, but it reached millions of young, fitness-focused customers directly. By 2020, Gymshark was valued at over &pound;1 billion. The business shows how e-commerce and social media marketing can allow a start-up to compete with much larger, established brands.</p>

        <p>Stakeholder and technology questions often ask you to <strong>analyse conflict</strong> or <strong>evaluate the impact</strong> of a decision on different groups. Always identify at least two stakeholders and explain how they are affected differently. For top marks, make a <strong>judgement</strong> about which stakeholder is affected most or whether the overall impact is positive or negative &mdash; and explain why.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Every business must manage the competing interests of its stakeholders while deciding how to use technology effectively. Getting this balance right is key to long-term success.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stakeholders have different interests:</strong> owners want profit, employees want fair pay, customers want value, and the community wants jobs without disruption.</li>
          <li><strong>Conflict is inevitable:</strong> satisfying one group often means disappointing another &mdash; businesses must find a balance.</li>
          <li><strong>Technology creates opportunities and tensions:</strong> e-commerce, social media, and automation can boost sales and cut costs, but may also cause job losses and require careful stakeholder management.</li>

Unlike traditional advertising such as TV or print, creating posts on Instagram or TikTok is free and the business only pays if it chooses to run paid promotions (1). This means a small business with a limited marketing budget can still build brand awareness and attract new customers, helping it compete with larger rivals that have much bigger advertising budgets (1)."

An online store is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, meaning the business can reach national or even international customers who would never visit a physical shop (1). This wider customer base increases the number of potential sales, and because an online store is open 24 hours a day, customers can buy at any time \u2014 including evenings and weekends when a physical shop might be closed (1)."

Machines can work continuously without breaks, holidays, or sick pay, and they produce consistent, high-quality output with fewer errors. This means the business can increase production while reducing its wage bill, leading to higher profit margins. However, the initial cost of purchasing and installing automated equipment is very high, which is a major barrier for a small business with limited finance. There is also the human cost \u2014 existing employees may lose their jobs, which damages staff morale and can create bad publicity in the local community. The business may also need to hire or train specialist staff to maintain the new equipment. Overall, automation is likely to benefit the business in the long term if it can afford the upfront investment, but it needs to manage the impact on employees carefully to avoid stakeholder conflict and reputational damage.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about automation."

        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: Option A \u2014 launching an e-commerce website \u2014 would allow Karim to reach customers across a much wider area, not just people who walk past his shop. An online store would be open 24/7, and he could use social media marketing to attract new customers cheaply. However, baked goods are perishable, so delivery logistics would be challenging and expensive. He would also need to invest in packaging, a delivery service, and a professional website, and he would face competition from established online bakeries. Option B \u2014 expanding into a caf\u00e9 \u2014 would increase revenue by attracting customers who want to sit and eat rather than just buy takeaway. A caf\u00e9 encourages customers to spend more per visit on drinks and additional items. Karim already has a loyal local customer base, so adding seating builds on an existing strength. However, the extra rent, staff wages, and fit-out costs would increase his fixed costs significantly. On balance, Option B is likely the better choice. Karim\u2019s products are fresh and perishable, making online delivery risky and expensive. A caf\u00e9 extension plays to his strengths \u2014 a good local reputation and foot traffic \u2014 and gives him a more reliable way to increase revenue without the logistical challenges of e-commerce delivery.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
