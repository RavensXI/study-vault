        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Why Businesses Need Finance</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Every business needs money to get started and to keep running. <dfn class="term" data-def="Money used to set up, run, or expand a business. Can come from internal or external sources.">Finance</dfn> is the money a business uses to pay for its activities &mdash; from buying stock and equipment to paying wages and rent.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">Businesses need finance for different reasons at different stages:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n4">
          <li><strong>Start-up costs</strong> &mdash; one-off expenses to launch the business (equipment, stock, deposits, legal fees)</li>
          <li><strong>Running costs</strong> &mdash; ongoing day-to-day expenses (wages, rent, utilities, raw materials)</li>
          <li><strong>Expansion</strong> &mdash; investing in growth (new premises, extra staff, more stock)</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">The right source of finance depends on how much money is needed, how quickly it is needed, and whether the business wants to repay a debt or give up a share of ownership.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n6">Short-Term Sources of Finance</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n7"><dfn class="term" data-def="Finance that is borrowed or used for a short period, usually less than one year.">Short-term finance</dfn> covers needs that last less than a year &mdash; such as bridging a gap in cash flow or buying seasonal stock.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n8">Overdraft</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">An <dfn class="term" data-def="An agreement with a bank that allows a business to spend more money than it has in its account, up to an agreed limit.">overdraft</dfn> lets a business spend more than it has in its bank account, up to an agreed limit. It is flexible &mdash; the business only borrows what it needs and pays interest only on the amount overdrawn.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n10">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Very flexible &mdash; ideal for covering short-term cash-flow gaps</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Interest rates are usually high, and the bank can withdraw the facility at any time</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n11">Trade Credit</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n12"><dfn class="term" data-def="An agreement where a supplier allows a business to receive goods now and pay for them later, usually within 30 to 90 days.">Trade credit</dfn> is when a supplier allows a business to receive goods now and pay later, usually within 30&ndash;90 days. This means the business can sell the goods and use the revenue to pay the supplier.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n13">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> No interest charged &mdash; it is essentially a free short-term loan</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Not always available to new businesses, as suppliers may want proof of reliability first</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n14">Long-Term Sources of Finance</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n15"><dfn class="term" data-def="Finance used over a longer period, usually more than one year, to fund major investments or business growth.">Long-term finance</dfn> is used for bigger investments that will benefit the business over several years &mdash; such as buying premises, vehicles, or expensive equipment.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n16">Personal Savings</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">Many sole traders and small business owners use their own savings to start their business. This is the simplest source of finance &mdash; there is no interest to pay and no ownership to give away.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n18">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> No debt, no interest, and the owner keeps full control</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Limited by how much the owner has saved &mdash; may not be enough for larger ventures</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n19">Venture Capital</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n20"><dfn class="term" data-def="Investment from specialist firms or individuals who provide large sums of money to businesses with high growth potential, in exchange for a share of ownership.">Venture capital</dfn> is investment from specialist firms or wealthy individuals who put large sums into businesses they believe will grow rapidly. In return, they take a share of ownership and often want a say in how the business is run.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n21">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Provides large amounts of funding plus business expertise and contacts</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> The owner gives up some control and a share of future profits</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n22">Share Capital</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n23"><dfn class="term" data-def="Money raised by selling shares (part-ownership) in a limited company to investors.">Share capital</dfn> is money raised by selling shares in a limited company. Each share represents a small piece of ownership, and shareholders may receive a share of profits called <dfn class="term" data-def="A share of a company's profits paid to shareholders, usually once or twice a year.">dividends</dfn>.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n24">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Can raise very large amounts without taking on debt</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Only available to limited companies, and the original owner&rsquo;s share of ownership is diluted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n25">Loans</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n26">A <dfn class="term" data-def="A fixed amount of money borrowed from a bank or other lender, repaid in regular instalments with interest over an agreed period.">loan</dfn> is a fixed sum borrowed from a bank, repaid in regular instalments with interest over an agreed period (e.g. 3&ndash;10 years). The interest rate is usually lower than an overdraft because the repayment terms are fixed.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n27">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Fixed repayments make budgeting easier; the business keeps full ownership</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Interest adds to costs, and the bank may require <dfn class="term" data-def="An asset (such as property or equipment) pledged to a lender as security for a loan. If the borrower cannot repay, the lender can seize the asset.">collateral</dfn> (an asset as security)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n28">Retained Profit</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n29"><dfn class="term" data-def="Profit that a business keeps and reinvests rather than paying out to the owners or shareholders.">Retained profit</dfn> is profit the business has already earned and chooses to reinvest rather than pay out to owners. It is the most common source of finance for established businesses.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n30">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> No interest, no loss of control &mdash; the cheapest source of finance</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Only available to businesses that are already making a profit &mdash; not useful for start-ups</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n31">Crowdfunding</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n32"><dfn class="term" data-def="Raising small amounts of money from a large number of people, usually through an online platform such as Kickstarter or Crowdcube.">Crowdfunding</dfn> raises small amounts from a large number of people, usually through online platforms like Kickstarter or Crowdcube. Backers may receive rewards (e.g. early access to the product) or a small share of the business.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n33">
          <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Tests whether customers want the product before it launches; doubles as marketing</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> No guarantee of reaching the funding target; the business idea is publicly visible to competitors</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n34">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Finance sources are either <strong>internal</strong> (from within the business &mdash; personal savings, retained profit) or <strong>external</strong> (from outside &mdash; loans, overdrafts, venture capital, share capital, crowdfunding, trade credit). Internal sources avoid debt and interest, but are limited in amount.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n35">Choosing the Right Source</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n36">The best source of finance depends on several factors:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n37">
          <li><strong>Amount needed</strong> &mdash; small amounts suit overdrafts or savings; large amounts may need loans or share capital</li>
          <li><strong>Time period</strong> &mdash; short-term needs suit overdrafts and trade credit; long-term needs suit loans and share capital</li>
          <li><strong>Willingness to give up control</strong> &mdash; venture capital and share capital mean sharing ownership</li>
          <li><strong>Cost</strong> &mdash; interest charges on loans and overdrafts increase overall costs</li>
          <li><strong>Stage of business</strong> &mdash; start-ups cannot use retained profit; established businesses have more options</li>
        </ul>

              <p data-narration-id="n38">Scottish craft brewery Brewdog needed finance to expand but did not want to borrow from banks or give control to venture capitalists. Instead, they launched &ldquo;Equity for Punks&rdquo; &mdash; a crowdfunding campaign that sold shares directly to customers. Over several rounds, they raised more than &pound;90 million from over 200,000 small investors. Each investor became a part-owner of the company and received perks like discounts and free beer on their birthday. This approach gave Brewdog the finance it needed while building a loyal community of brand ambassadors.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Questions about finance sources often ask you to <strong>recommend</strong> a source for a specific business. Always link your answer to the <strong>context</strong> &mdash; consider whether the business is a start-up or established, how much money is needed, and whether the owner wants to keep full control. A generic answer like &ldquo;they should get a loan&rdquo; without explaining why will not reach the top marks.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n40">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Businesses can choose from a range of internal and external finance sources. The right choice depends on how much is needed, for how long, and how much control the owner is willing to share.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Internal vs external:</strong> personal savings and retained profit are internal (no debt); loans, overdrafts, venture capital, share capital, and crowdfunding are external.</li>
          <li><strong>Short-term vs long-term:</strong> overdrafts and trade credit cover short-term gaps; loans, share capital, and venture capital fund bigger investments.</li>
          <li><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> every source has a cost &mdash; either interest payments or giving up a share of ownership and control.</li>
        </ul>

This means the bank cannot see evidence of past profits or reliable cash flow to judge whether the business will be able to make the repayments (1). As a result, the bank sees the loan as high risk and may refuse it or charge a very high interest rate, making it an expensive option even if the loan is approved (1)."

If many people are willing to back the project and pledge money, it shows there is genuine interest in the product (1). This reduces the risk of the business spending money on a product nobody wants, and the campaign itself acts as free marketing that raises awareness before the product even reaches the market (1)."

        marks: "Award up to 6 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Detailed discussion of both advantages and disadvantages with developed reasoning and a judgement.\nExample: Venture capital can provide large amounts of money that a small business could not access through personal savings or bank loans. This is especially useful for a new product that requires expensive development, testing, and marketing before it generates any revenue. Venture capitalists also bring expertise, business contacts, and credibility that can help the business grow faster. However, venture capitalists take a share of ownership and often want significant control over business decisions. The original owner may lose the ability to run the business the way they want. Venture capitalists also expect high returns and may push for rapid growth or an early sale of the business, which may not align with the owner\u2019s vision. Overall, venture capital is a good option if the business needs substantial funding and the owner is willing to share control \u2014 but for an owner who values independence, a loan or crowdfunding may be better.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about venture capital."

She has \u00a35,000 in personal savings. She is considering two options to raise the remaining \u00a310,000: (A) take out a bank loan over 5 years, or (B) find a business partner who will invest \u00a310,000 in exchange for a 40% share of the business.\n\nJustify which option Priya should choose.",
        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: A bank loan would give Priya the \u00a310,000 she needs without giving up any ownership. She would make fixed monthly repayments over 5 years, which she can plan for in her cash-flow forecast. This means she keeps full control of all business decisions and 100% of future profits. However, the loan will have interest charges that increase her total costs, and she will need to make repayments from the start \u2014 even if the business is not yet generating enough revenue. She may also need to offer collateral. Taking on a business partner would also provide the \u00a310,000, and the partner might bring useful skills or contacts to help the business succeed. There is no interest to pay and no fixed repayments draining cash flow. However, Priya would lose 40% of her business, meaning 40% of all future profits go to the partner and she must consult them on major decisions. Over time, if the business is successful, 40% of the profits could far exceed the interest she would have paid on a loan. On balance, Priya should take the bank loan. The repayments are manageable over 5 years, and she keeps full ownership and control. Giving away 40% for just \u00a310,000 is a high price to pay, especially if the business grows and becomes very profitable.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
