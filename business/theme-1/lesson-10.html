        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Types of Business Ownership</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">When starting a business, one of the most important decisions is choosing the right type of ownership. This affects who controls the business, how profits are shared, and how much personal risk the owner takes on. The main types for small businesses are <dfn class="term" data-def="A business owned and run by one person. The owner has unlimited liability and keeps all profits after tax.">sole traders</dfn>, <dfn class="term" data-def="A business owned by two or more people who share responsibility, decision-making, and profits.">partnerships</dfn>, and <dfn class="term" data-def="A business that is a separate legal entity from its owners. Shareholders have limited liability and shares are sold privately.">private limited companies</dfn> (Ltd).</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">Sole Trader</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">A sole trader is the simplest form of business ownership. One person owns and runs the business. There is no legal separation between the owner and the business &mdash; they are treated as the same thing in law.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n5">
          <li><strong>Easy to set up</strong> &mdash; the owner just needs to register with HMRC for self-assessment tax</li>
          <li><strong>Full control</strong> &mdash; the owner makes all the decisions without consulting anyone else</li>
          <li><strong>Keeps all profits</strong> &mdash; after tax, everything the business earns belongs to the owner</li>
          <li><strong>Unlimited liability</strong> &mdash; the owner is personally responsible for all business debts</li>
          <li><strong>Limited finance</strong> &mdash; relies on personal savings and loans, as there are no shares to sell</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">Sole traders are very common in the UK. Examples include plumbers, hairdressers, tutors, and market stall owners. Although the business is owned by one person, a sole trader can still employ staff.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n7">Partnership</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">A partnership is a business owned by two or more people (up to 20 in most cases). The partners share responsibility for running the business, and profits are divided between them according to an agreement.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">Most partnerships draw up a <dfn class="term" data-def="A legal document that sets out the rules of a partnership, including how profits are shared, how much each partner invests, and what happens if a partner leaves.">deed of partnership</dfn>. This is a legal document that sets out how profits will be split, how much capital each partner contributes, roles and responsibilities, and what happens if a partner wants to leave.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n10">
          <li><strong>More capital</strong> &mdash; partners can pool their savings, giving the business more start-up finance</li>
          <li><strong>Shared workload</strong> &mdash; partners bring different skills and can cover for each other</li>
          <li><strong>Unlimited liability</strong> &mdash; each partner is personally liable for the business&rsquo;s debts, including debts created by the other partners</li>
          <li><strong>Shared profits</strong> &mdash; profits must be divided, so each person takes home less than if they were a sole trader</li>
          <li><strong>Potential disagreements</strong> &mdash; decisions must be agreed between partners, which can cause conflict</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">Partnerships are common in professional services such as solicitors, accountants, and doctors&rsquo; surgeries.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n12">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Without a <strong>deed of partnership</strong>, the Partnership Act 1890 applies by default &mdash; this means profits are shared equally, regardless of how much each partner invested. A written deed avoids disputes by making the rules clear from the start.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n13">Private Limited Company (Ltd)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">A private limited company is a business that has its own legal identity, separate from its owners. The owners are called <dfn class="term" data-def="A person who owns one or more shares in a limited company. Shareholders may receive dividends and can vote on major company decisions.">shareholders</dfn>, and each one owns a portion of the company through shares. Shares can only be sold privately &mdash; to friends, family, or approved investors &mdash; not to the general public on a stock exchange.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">Setting up an Ltd requires more paperwork. The business must register with Companies House and file <dfn class="term" data-def="A legal document that sets out the rules for running a limited company, including the rights of shareholders and the responsibilities of directors.">Articles of Association</dfn>, which outline the internal rules of the company. The company must also file annual accounts that are available to the public.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n16">
          <li><strong>Limited liability</strong> &mdash; shareholders can only lose the amount they invested, not their personal assets</li>
          <li><strong>Separate legal entity</strong> &mdash; the company can own property, enter contracts, and sue or be sued in its own name</li>
          <li><strong>Easier to raise finance</strong> &mdash; can sell shares to private investors and access larger bank loans</li>
          <li><strong>More complex and costly to set up</strong> &mdash; registration fees, legal paperwork, and ongoing filing requirements</li>
          <li><strong>Less privacy</strong> &mdash; annual accounts must be filed with Companies House and are publicly available</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">Shareholders may receive a share of the company&rsquo;s profits called a <dfn class="term" data-def="A share of a company's profits paid to shareholders, usually once or twice a year.">dividend</dfn>. The directors (who may also be shareholders) run the business day-to-day.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n18">Unlimited Liability vs Limited Liability</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">The difference between <dfn class="term" data-def="The owner is personally responsible for all the debts of the business. If the business cannot pay, the owner's personal assets (house, car, savings) can be seized to cover what is owed.">unlimited liability</dfn> and <dfn class="term" data-def="Shareholders can only lose the money they invested in the business. Their personal assets are protected if the business fails.">limited liability</dfn> is one of the most important concepts in business ownership.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n20">
          <li><strong>Unlimited liability</strong> means the owner&rsquo;s personal assets &mdash; their house, car, savings &mdash; can be used to pay off business debts. Sole traders and partners have unlimited liability.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited liability</strong> means shareholders can only lose the amount of money they invested in the business. Their personal belongings are protected. This applies to private limited companies.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n21">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p><strong>Unlimited liability</strong> is the biggest risk for sole traders and partners. If the business fails with &pound;50,000 of debt, the owner must pay it &mdash; even if that means selling their home. With <strong>limited liability</strong>, the most a shareholder can lose is what they put in.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n22">Franchises</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">A <dfn class="term" data-def="A business model where a person buys the right to trade using an established brand's name, products, and systems in exchange for a fee and ongoing royalties.">franchise</dfn> is not a type of ownership in itself, but a way of starting a business using someone else&rsquo;s brand. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A person or business that buys the right to operate a franchise using the franchisor's brand, products, and systems.">franchisee</dfn> pays a fee to the <dfn class="term" data-def="The owner of a brand or business model who sells the right to use it to franchisees in exchange for fees and royalties.">franchisor</dfn> for the right to use an established brand name, products, and business systems. Well-known examples include McDonald&rsquo;s, Subway, and Domino&rsquo;s.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">The franchisee typically pays an upfront fee plus ongoing royalties (a percentage of revenue). In return, they get a proven business model that customers already recognise and trust.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n25">Advantages of Franchising</h3>

        <ul data-narration-id="n26">
          <li><strong>Proven business model</strong> &mdash; the product and systems have already been tested and shown to work</li>
          <li><strong>Brand recognition</strong> &mdash; customers already know and trust the brand, so less marketing is needed</li>
          <li><strong>Training and support</strong> &mdash; the franchisor provides training, equipment guidance, and ongoing help</li>
          <li><strong>Lower risk of failure</strong> &mdash; franchises have a higher survival rate than independent start-ups</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n27">Disadvantages of Franchising</h3>

        <ul data-narration-id="n28">
          <li><strong>Less freedom</strong> &mdash; the franchisee must follow the franchisor&rsquo;s rules on products, pricing, and store layout</li>
          <li><strong>Ongoing costs</strong> &mdash; royalty payments reduce profits, and the initial franchise fee can be very high</li>
          <li><strong>Reputation risk</strong> &mdash; if the franchisor or another franchisee damages the brand, all franchisees suffer</li>
          <li><strong>Exit restrictions</strong> &mdash; the franchise agreement may limit the ability to sell or close the business</li>
        </ul>

              <p data-narration-id="n29">Subway is one of the world&rsquo;s largest franchise operations, with over 37,000 restaurants worldwide. A new Subway franchisee in the UK typically pays an initial fee of around &pound;10,000 plus the cost of fitting out the restaurant. In return, Subway provides site selection advice, staff training, marketing campaigns, and an established supply chain. However, franchisees must follow strict rules &mdash; from the menu items offered to the layout of the shop floor. They also pay 8% of weekly revenue in royalties and 3.5% towards marketing. For someone who wants to run a food business without the risk of building a brand from scratch, a Subway franchise offers a ready-made system &mdash; but it comes at the cost of independence and a significant share of revenue.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n30">Factors Affecting the Choice of Ownership</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n31">There is no single &ldquo;best&rdquo; type of ownership. The right choice depends on the circumstances of the business and its owner. Key factors include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n32">

          <p>Many businesses start as sole traders for simplicity and later convert to an Ltd as they grow &mdash; gaining limited liability and the ability to raise share capital, while accepting the extra paperwork and loss of privacy.</p>

        <p>When a question asks you to recommend a type of ownership, always link your answer to the <strong>context</strong> given in the question. Consider the size of the business, how much finance is needed, and whether the owner wants to keep full control. A strong answer weighs up the trade-offs &mdash; for example, &ldquo;An Ltd gives limited liability but costs more to set up and requires filing accounts.&rdquo; Generic answers without reasoning will not reach top marks.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The type of ownership a business chooses shapes its legal responsibilities, risk exposure, and ability to grow. Understanding the differences between sole traders, partnerships, and private limited companies &mdash; and the distinction between unlimited and limited liability &mdash; is essential for answering exam questions about business start-ups.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Liability matters most:</strong> sole traders and partners risk their personal assets (unlimited liability), while Ltd shareholders only risk what they invested (limited liability).</li>
          <li><strong>Trade-offs everywhere:</strong> sole traders get simplicity and full control but limited finance; Ltd companies can raise more money but face more regulation and shared ownership.</li>
          <li><strong>Franchises offer a middle ground:</strong> a proven brand and support system, but at the cost of freedom and ongoing fees.</li>
        </ul>

Partners also bring different skills and knowledge \u2014 for example, one partner might be good at sales while the other handles finance \u2014 which can make the business more effective. The workload is shared, reducing stress and allowing the business to operate even if one partner is unwell. However, profits must be shared between the partners, so each person takes home less than if they ran the business alone. Disagreements between partners can slow down decision-making and damage the business. Crucially, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts of the whole partnership, including debts caused by the other partner\u2019s decisions. Overall, a partnership is better for people who value shared expertise and finance, but a sole trader is better for someone who wants full control and is willing to accept the risks of working alone.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about partnerships or sole traders."

        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: Operating as a sole trader would mean Amir keeps all of the \u00a340,000 profit himself, rather than sharing it with Khalid. He would have complete control over every decision \u2014 which jobs to take, when to work, and how to price his services. Setting up is simple and cheap, with minimal paperwork. However, as a sole trader Amir would have unlimited liability, meaning his personal assets are at risk if anything goes wrong. He would also bear the full workload alone \u2014 if he is ill, the business earns nothing. Forming a partnership with Khalid would give the business more capacity to take on jobs, potentially increasing total revenue beyond \u00a340,000. Two electricians can handle bigger contracts and cover for each other during holidays or illness. Khalid could also contribute start-up capital, such as money for a van and tools. However, profits must be shared, and if they disagree on business decisions it could damage both the business and their friendship. Both partners also have unlimited liability for each other\u2019s actions. On balance, Amir should start as a sole trader. As a qualified electrician earning \u00a340,000, his income is strong enough to work alone. He keeps full control and all profits. If demand grows later, he can always bring Khalid in as a partner or employee at that point, rather than committing to a partnership from the start.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
