        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">What Is Enterprise?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2"><dfn class="term" data-def="The activity of turning a new idea into a business that earns revenue.">Enterprise</dfn> is the process of identifying a business opportunity and taking the risk to set up a business. It involves spotting a gap in the market or a better way of doing things, then organising the resources needed to make it happen.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n3">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>An <dfn class="term" data-def="A person who takes the financial risk of starting and running a new business.">entrepreneur</dfn> is someone who takes the financial risk of starting and running a business. The UK has over 5.5 million small businesses, and they account for 99.9% of all businesses in the country. Famous UK entrepreneurs include James Dyson (vacuum cleaners), Anita Roddick (The Body Shop), and Alan Sugar (Amstrad).</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n4">Why Do People Start Businesses?</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">People become entrepreneurs for different reasons. Some are driven by financial rewards &mdash; the chance to earn more than they would as an employee. Others want independence: being their own boss and making their own decisions. Some spot a gap in the market and are passionate about filling it. Others may have been made redundant and see starting a business as the best alternative.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n6">
          <li><strong>Financial rewards</strong> &mdash; keeping the profits rather than earning a fixed salary</li>
          <li><strong>Independence</strong> &mdash; being your own boss, choosing your own hours</li>
          <li><strong>Passion</strong> &mdash; turning a hobby or interest into a career</li>
          <li><strong>Dissatisfaction</strong> &mdash; frustration with existing products or a former employer</li>
          <li><strong>Redundancy</strong> &mdash; job loss forcing a new direction</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n7">Where Do New Business Ideas Come From?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">Markets are <dfn class="term" data-def="A market that is constantly changing due to new technology, consumer tastes, or competitor activity.">dynamic</dfn> &mdash; they change constantly. New business ideas come about because of changes in technology, shifts in what consumers want, and existing products or services becoming <dfn class="term" data-def="No longer useful or in demand because something better has replaced it.">obsolete</dfn>.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">Changes in Technology</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">New technology creates entirely new markets. Smartphones created opportunities for app developers. Social media created a whole industry of digital marketing. Streaming services like Netflix and Spotify made DVD rental shops and CD stores obsolete. Businesses that fail to adapt to technological change risk being left behind.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n11">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Blockbuster Video had over 9,000 stores worldwide in 2004. By 2013, the company was bankrupt &mdash; destroyed by Netflix&rsquo;s streaming model. This is a textbook example of how changes in technology make existing business models obsolete.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n12">Changes in Consumer Wants</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">What customers want changes over time. Growing awareness of health and fitness created demand for gym memberships, protein bars, and fitness apps. Concern about the environment led to demand for electric vehicles, reusable packaging, and plant-based food. Businesses that spot these trends early have a <dfn class="term" data-def="An advantage over competitors gained by being the first to enter a market or offer a new product.">first-mover advantage</dfn>.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n14">Products and Services Becoming Obsolete</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">When existing products become outdated, new opportunities appear. Film cameras were replaced by digital cameras, which were then largely replaced by smartphone cameras. Typewriters gave way to word processors, then laptops, then tablets. Each shift opened a gap in the market for new businesses.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n16">Original Ideas vs. Adapting Existing Ideas</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">New business ideas fall into two broad categories:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n18">
          <li><strong>Original ideas</strong> &mdash; a completely new product or service that did not exist before. These are rare and carry high risk, but the potential rewards are huge. Example: when Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, it created a new category of product.</li>
          <li><strong>Adapting existing ideas</strong> &mdash; taking a product, service, or business model that already works and improving it or applying it to a new market. This is far more common and usually less risky. Example: Innocent Drinks did not invent smoothies, but they spotted a gap for convenient, natural fruit drinks and built a brand around it.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Case Study: Innocent Drinks</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n19">In 1999, three Cambridge graduates &mdash; Richard Reed, Adam Balon, and Jon Wright &mdash; spent &pound;500 on fruit to test their smoothie recipes at a music festival. They put up a sign asking &ldquo;Should we give up our jobs to make these smoothies?&rdquo; with bins marked &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; bin filled up. They quit their jobs the next day.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n20">Innocent did not invent smoothies &mdash; they adapted an existing product by focusing on natural ingredients, fun branding, and ethical sourcing. By 2008 they had 71% of the UK smoothie market. Coca-Cola bought a majority stake in 2013 for over &pound;100 million. Their story shows how adapting an existing idea with a clear <dfn class="term" data-def="A feature or combination of features that makes a business stand out from competitors.">unique selling point</dfn> (USP) can be hugely successful.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n21">Risk and Reward</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n22">Every business involves <dfn class="term" data-def="The possibility of financial loss or business failure.">risk</dfn>. Entrepreneurs invest their own money, time, and effort with no guarantee of success. The potential <dfn class="term" data-def="The financial return or personal satisfaction gained from a successful business.">rewards</dfn> &mdash; profit, independence, personal satisfaction, and capital growth &mdash; balance out the risk.</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_risk_reward.jpg" alt="Infographic showing a balance scale weighing business risks (financial loss, no guaranteed income, long hours, 60% failure rate) against rewards (profit, independence, personal satisfaction, capital growth)">
        </figure>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n26">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The relationship between risk and reward is central to business. Generally, the higher the risk, the higher the potential reward. A safe savings account earns low interest; investing everything in a new business idea could lead to bankruptcy &mdash; or millions. Entrepreneurs are people willing to take calculated risks in the hope of earning rewards.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n27">The Purpose of Business Activity</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n28">The basic purpose of all business activity is to produce <dfn class="term" data-def="Physical items made by a business, such as cars, food, or clothing.">goods</dfn> or provide <dfn class="term" data-def="Non-physical activities sold by a business, such as haircuts, insurance, or web design.">services</dfn> that meet customer needs and wants. Businesses do this to earn revenue and, ultimately, to make a <dfn class="term" data-def="The amount left over when total costs are subtracted from total revenue.">profit</dfn>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n29">However, not all businesses aim primarily for profit. <dfn class="term" data-def="An organisation that reinvests surplus revenue into its social mission rather than distributing it to owners.">Social enterprises</dfn> like The Big Issue exist to address social problems. They trade like regular businesses but reinvest most of their profits into their cause rather than paying shareholders.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n30">The Role of Entrepreneurship</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n31">Entrepreneurs play a vital role in the economy. They create jobs, generate tax revenue for the government, and drive <dfn class="term" data-def="New ideas, products, or ways of doing things that improve on what already exists.">innovation</dfn>. Without entrepreneurs willing to take risks, there would be fewer new products, less competition, and less economic growth.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n32">Key entrepreneurial skills include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n33">
          <li><strong>Creativity</strong> &mdash; generating new ideas or finding new approaches</li>
          <li><strong>Risk-taking</strong> &mdash; being willing to invest money and time with uncertain outcomes</li>
          <li><strong>Determination</strong> &mdash; persisting through setbacks and challenges</li>
          <li><strong>Decision-making</strong> &mdash; making quick, informed choices under pressure</li>
          <li><strong>Communication</strong> &mdash; persuading investors, customers, and employees</li>
        </ul>

Every major manufacturer rejected his design, so he set up his own company. Today, Dyson is worth over &pound;5 billion and employs thousands of people globally. His story demonstrates every key entrepreneurial trait: creativity (original cyclone technology), risk-taking (remortgaging his house to fund development), determination (5,127 failed prototypes), and the enormous rewards that can follow.</p>

        <p>In the exam, you will always be given a case study about a real or fictional business. When asked about enterprise or entrepreneurship, always link your answer back to the specific business in the case study &mdash; don&rsquo;t just write general theory. For example, if asked to &ldquo;discuss whether the entrepreneur took a risk,&rdquo; explain what they risked and what they stood to gain, using evidence from the source booklet.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n36">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Enterprise is about spotting opportunities and taking the risk to turn them into a business. New ideas come from changes in technology, shifts in consumer wants, and products becoming obsolete. Entrepreneurs can create original ideas or adapt existing ones. The key trade-off is always risk versus reward.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dynamic markets:</strong> Technology and consumer trends constantly create new opportunities and make old products obsolete.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk and reward:</strong> Every business carries financial risk, but the potential rewards &mdash; profit, independence, satisfaction &mdash; drive entrepreneurs to start businesses.</li>
          <li><strong>Entrepreneurial skills:</strong> Creativity, risk-taking, determination, and strong communication are essential for business success.</li>
        </ul>

Around 60% of UK start-ups close within three years. However, the potential rewards include substantial profit if the business succeeds. Entrepreneurs like James Dyson invested everything and eventually became billionaires. Whether the rewards outweigh the risks depends on factors like the size of investment, the entrepreneur\u2019s skills, and market conditions.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion of risks and/or rewards with some development.\nExample: One risk is that the business could fail and the entrepreneur would lose their investment. A reward is that successful businesses can earn a lot of profit. Starting a business also gives the owner independence.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic statements about risks or rewards.\nExample: You could lose money. / You might make a profit."

Customers already trust the brand, so she would not need to spend heavily on marketing. However, franchise fees and royalties would reduce her profits, and she would have limited freedom to create her own recipes \u2014 which was her original motivation. Developing original recipes carries more risk because there is no proven demand, but it allows Reeva to create a unique selling point and keep all profits. On balance, Reeva should develop her own original recipes because the smoothie market already has many established brands, so a distinctive product is more likely to attract customers than another franchise outlet.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nExample: A franchise would be less risky because the brand is already known. But original recipes would let Reeva be more creative. She should probably choose original recipes because she can make them unique.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options.\nExample: A franchise is safer. / Original recipes would be cheaper because there are no fees."
