        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Why Laws Matter to Businesses</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Businesses do not operate in a vacuum. The government passes <dfn class="term" data-def="Laws created by Parliament that businesses must follow, covering areas such as employment, consumer protection, and health and safety.">legislation</dfn> &mdash; laws that every business must follow. These laws protect workers, customers, and the wider public. Breaking them can lead to fines, legal action, or closure.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">For small businesses, keeping up with the law is especially important. They rarely have a legal department, so the owner must understand their responsibilities and build compliance into everyday operations.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Employment Law</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">Employment law protects people at work. It sets out the rights of employees and the duties of employers. Key areas include:</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n6">The National Minimum Wage &amp; National Living Wage</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">The <dfn class="term" data-def="The lowest hourly rate an employer can legally pay a worker. The exact rate depends on the worker&rsquo;s age and is updated each year by the government.">minimum wage</dfn> is the lowest hourly rate an employer can legally pay. Workers aged 21 and over receive the National Living Wage (a higher rate), while younger workers and apprentices receive lower rates. These figures are updated every April.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n8">
          <li><strong>Impact on businesses:</strong> Increases wage costs, especially for labour-intensive firms like shops and restaurants. However, it can motivate workers and reduce staff turnover.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">Working Hours &amp; Health and Safety</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">The Working Time Regulations limit most employees to a 48-hour working week (unless they opt out) and guarantee rest breaks and paid holidays. Health and safety laws require employers to carry out risk assessments, provide safe equipment, and train staff to avoid workplace injuries.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n11">
          <li><strong>Impact on businesses:</strong> Compliance costs money &mdash; buying safety equipment, training staff, and carrying out inspections. But it reduces accidents, sick days, and the risk of compensation claims.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n12">Discrimination Law</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">The Equality Act 2010 makes it illegal to discriminate against employees or job applicants on grounds such as age, gender, race, disability, religion, or sexual orientation. This applies to hiring, pay, promotion, and dismissal.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n14">
          <li><strong>Impact on businesses:</strong> Employers must ensure fair recruitment and workplace policies. Discrimination claims can be costly and damage the business&rsquo;s reputation.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n15">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Employment law covers three main areas for the exam: <strong>minimum wage</strong> (sets the lowest legal pay), <strong>health and safety</strong> (protects workers from harm), and <strong>discrimination</strong> (ensures equal treatment). All three increase costs but protect workers and create fairer workplaces.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n16">Consumer Law</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">Consumer law protects customers when they buy goods or services. The most important piece of consumer legislation is the <dfn class="term" data-def="A UK law that gives buyers the right to return or get a refund on goods that are not of satisfactory quality, not fit for purpose, or not as described.">Consumer Rights Act</dfn> 2015.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n18">The Consumer Rights Act 2015</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">Under this law, all goods sold must be:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n20">
          <li><strong>Of satisfactory quality</strong> &mdash; free from defects and of a reasonable standard for the price paid</li>
          <li><strong>Fit for purpose</strong> &mdash; suitable for the use the customer was told it would serve</li>
          <li><strong>As described</strong> &mdash; matching any description given by the seller, on packaging, or in advertising</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">If goods do not meet these standards, the customer has the right to a refund, repair, or replacement. Services must also be carried out with reasonable care and skill.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n22">
          <li><strong>Impact on businesses:</strong> Businesses must ensure quality control is strong. Dealing with returns and refunds costs money, but complying with consumer law builds customer trust and repeat business.</li>
        </ul>

The business must also pay return postage. This is why accurate product descriptions and quality checks matter &mdash; a single misleading claim can lead to refund costs, negative reviews, and lost customers.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n24">The Economy and Business</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n25">The wider economy affects every business, large or small. Four economic factors appear regularly in the exam: <dfn class="term" data-def="The number of people who are willing and able to work but cannot find a job.">unemployment</dfn>, <dfn class="term" data-def="The total amount of money that households have available to spend after tax, which determines how much they can buy.">consumer income</dfn>, <dfn class="term" data-def="A sustained rise in the general price level of goods and services over time, reducing the purchasing power of money.">inflation</dfn>, and <dfn class="term" data-def="The percentage charged by a lender on borrowed money, or paid by a bank on savings. Set by the Bank of England&rsquo;s base rate.">interest rates</dfn>.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n26">Unemployment</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n27">When unemployment is high, fewer people have a regular income. This means less spending in the economy, which reduces demand for goods and services. Small businesses &mdash; especially those selling non-essential items &mdash; feel this quickly.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n28">
          <li><strong>High unemployment:</strong> Less consumer spending, lower revenue for businesses, but easier to recruit staff (more applicants per vacancy)</li>
          <li><strong>Low unemployment:</strong> More consumer spending, higher demand, but harder and more expensive to recruit and retain workers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n29">Changing Levels of Consumer Income</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n30">When people earn more, they spend more &mdash; particularly on luxury and non-essential goods. When incomes fall or stagnate, consumers cut back and focus on essentials.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n31">
          <li><strong>Rising income:</strong> Demand for premium products increases; businesses can charge higher prices or expand their range</li>
          <li><strong>Falling income:</strong> Consumers switch to cheaper alternatives; small businesses selling luxuries may struggle while discount retailers benefit</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n32">Inflation</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n33">Inflation means prices across the economy are rising. For a small business, this pushes up the cost of raw materials, stock, energy, and rent. If the business raises its own prices to cover these costs, customers may buy less or switch to competitors.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n34">
          <li><strong>High inflation:</strong> Costs rise faster than revenue; workers demand higher wages; customers have less purchasing power</li>
          <li><strong>Low, stable inflation:</strong> Easier for businesses to plan and set prices; consumer spending is more predictable</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n35">Changes in Interest Rates</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n36">Interest rates are set by the Bank of England. When rates rise, borrowing becomes more expensive for both businesses and consumers. When rates fall, borrowing is cheaper.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n37">
          <li><strong>Higher interest rates:</strong> Loan repayments cost more, so businesses may delay expansion; consumers spend less (especially on big purchases bought on credit like cars or furniture)</li>
          <li><strong>Lower interest rates:</strong> Cheaper borrowing encourages investment and consumer spending; demand rises</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n38">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The four economic factors to remember are <strong>unemployment</strong>, <strong>consumer income</strong>, <strong>inflation</strong>, and <strong>interest rates</strong>. Each one affects both the demand for a business&rsquo;s products and its costs. Always explain the <em>chain of effect</em> &mdash; for example, higher interest rates &rarr; more expensive borrowing &rarr; less consumer spending &rarr; lower demand.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n39">External Influences on Business</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n40">Beyond legislation and the economy, several other external factors shape how a small business performs.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n41">The Economic Climate</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n42">The economy moves through cycles of growth (boom) and decline (recession). During a boom, consumer confidence is high and spending increases. During a recession, spending falls, businesses cut costs, and some may close. Small businesses are especially vulnerable because they have fewer financial reserves to survive a downturn.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n43">Weather and Seasonal Factors</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n44">Some businesses depend heavily on the weather or time of year. Ice cream shops thrive in summer but struggle in winter. A florist sees a spike in demand around Valentine&rsquo;s Day and Mother&rsquo;s Day. Unexpected weather events &mdash; floods, heatwaves, heavy snow &mdash; can disrupt supply chains or keep customers away.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n45">Environmental Concerns</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n46">Consumers increasingly care about the environmental impact of the products they buy. Businesses that use sustainable materials, reduce packaging, or cut carbon emissions can attract environmentally conscious customers. Those that ignore environmental concerns risk losing customers and may face stricter regulations in the future.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n47">The Competitive Environment</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n48">Every business faces competition. A new competitor opening nearby, a price war started by a larger rival, or a change in consumer tastes can all reduce a small business&rsquo;s sales. Businesses must monitor their competitors and respond &mdash; whether by lowering prices, improving quality, or offering something unique that competitors cannot match.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n49">A small independent caf&eacute; faces rising costs due to inflation (higher prices for coffee beans, milk, and energy), a minimum wage increase that pushes up staff costs, and a new chain coffee shop opening across the road. At the same time, consumer incomes are falling in real terms. The caf&eacute; cannot simply raise prices without losing customers to the cheaper chain. Instead, it focuses on what makes it unique &mdash; locally sourced food, a loyal community of regulars, and a cosy atmosphere that the chain cannot replicate. This shows how small businesses must adapt to multiple external pressures at once.</p>

        <p>When a question asks about external influences, always <strong>apply your answer to the specific business in the question</strong>. Do not just list factors &mdash; explain the <strong>chain of effect</strong>. For example: &ldquo;If interest rates rise, the business&rsquo;s loan repayments will increase, which reduces the cash available for stock, which could mean fewer products on the shelves and lower sales.&rdquo; This kind of linked reasoning is what moves your answer into the top marks.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Small businesses must operate within the law and respond to economic changes and external pressures they cannot control. Success depends on understanding these forces and adapting to them.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Legislation protects but costs:</strong> Employment law (minimum wage, health and safety, discrimination) and consumer law (Consumer Rights Act 2015) increase costs but create fairer, safer markets.</li>
          <li><strong>Economic factors drive demand:</strong> Unemployment, consumer income, inflation, and interest rates all affect how much customers spend and how much it costs to run a business.</li>
          <li><strong>External pressures combine:</strong> The economic climate, weather, environmental concerns, and competition all influence a small business &mdash; and they rarely arrive one at a time.</li>
        </ul>

This reduces consumer spending across the economy, especially on non-essential and luxury items like expensive handbags. The business is likely to see a fall in demand because customers with less disposable income will cut back on luxuries first. Revenue could drop significantly, making it harder to cover fixed costs like rent. However, there may be some benefits. The business may find it easier to recruit staff because there are more people looking for work, which could reduce recruitment costs and give the owner a wider choice of candidates. Labour costs might also fall if there is less competition for workers. On balance, the negative impact is likely to outweigh the positives for this particular business. Luxury goods are the first thing consumers stop buying in tough times, so falling demand is the bigger issue \u2014 even if staffing becomes cheaper.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about unemployment or the business."

        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both challenges with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: The minimum wage increase adds \u00a3800 per month to Kareem\u2019s costs. This is a fixed, unavoidable increase \u2014 he cannot legally pay below the minimum wage. With five employees in a small bakery, wages are likely to be one of his biggest costs, and an extra \u00a3800 per month (\u00a39,600 per year) will reduce his profit significantly. He could try to absorb the cost, but if his profit margins are already thin, he may need to raise prices \u2014 which could push customers towards the cheaper supermarket. The new supermarket is a serious competitive threat. Supermarkets benefit from economies of scale, so they can sell bread and cakes at prices Kareem cannot match. Customers who are price-sensitive may switch, reducing his revenue. However, Kareem\u2019s bakery can compete on quality, freshness, and personal service \u2014 things a supermarket struggles to offer. If he has loyal customers who value artisan products, the impact may be limited. On balance, the supermarket opening is likely to have the greater impact. The minimum wage increase is a manageable cost pressure that affects all businesses equally. But the supermarket directly threatens Kareem\u2019s customer base and revenue. If he loses enough customers to the supermarket, no amount of cost-cutting will save the business. The wage increase hurts margins, but the supermarket threatens survival.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both challenges with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both challenges."
