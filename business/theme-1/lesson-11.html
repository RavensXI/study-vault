        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Why Does Location Matter?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Choosing where to set up a business is one of the most important decisions an entrepreneur makes. The right location can bring customers to the door, keep costs low, and give the business an edge over competitors. The wrong location can mean high rent, few customers, and eventual closure.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3"><dfn class="term" data-def="How close a business is to something important, such as customers, suppliers, or workers.">Proximity</dfn> to customers, suppliers, and labour all influence where a business should be based. The best location depends on what kind of business it is and who its customers are.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Factors Influencing Business Location</h2>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n5">Proximity to Market (Customers)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">Businesses that sell directly to the public &mdash; such as shops, caf&eacute;s, and hairdressers &mdash; need to be close to their customers. A sandwich shop in a quiet side street will attract far fewer buyers than one on a busy high street. <dfn class="term" data-def="The number of people walking past a business premises in a given time period.">Footfall</dfn> is crucial for these businesses: the more people who pass the door, the more potential sales.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">However, not all businesses need to be near customers. A factory making car parts sells to other manufacturers, not to the public, so it can be based on a cheaper industrial estate far from the high street.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n8">Proximity to Materials and Suppliers</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">Businesses that use heavy or bulky raw materials benefit from being close to their suppliers. This reduces transport costs and delivery times. For example, a bakery that uses fresh flour and dairy products daily may choose a location near its wholesale suppliers to keep ingredients fresh and delivery costs low.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n10">Proximity to Labour</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">Businesses need access to workers with the right skills. A tech start-up might locate near a university town to recruit skilled graduates. A warehouse needs access to a large pool of workers willing to do manual work. If a business is in a remote area, it may struggle to attract or retain staff.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n12">Proximity to Competitors</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">Being close to competitors can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. Clusters of similar businesses &mdash; like a row of restaurants on the same street &mdash; attract more customers overall because people know the area is a good place to go for that product. However, being too close to a strong competitor can mean losing sales to them.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n14">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The four main factors affecting business location are proximity to <strong>customers</strong>, <strong>materials/suppliers</strong>, <strong>labour</strong>, and <strong>competitors</strong>. The importance of each factor depends on the type of business. A retail shop prioritises customers; a manufacturer prioritises suppliers and raw materials.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n15">Fixed Costs and Location</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n16"><dfn class="term" data-def="Costs that stay the same regardless of how much a business produces or sells, such as rent, insurance, and salaries.">Fixed costs</dfn> vary enormously depending on where a business is based. Rent and business rates are the biggest location-related costs for most businesses.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n17">
          <li><strong>City centre / high street</strong> &mdash; expensive rent and rates, but high footfall and visibility. Best for retail and hospitality businesses that rely on passing trade.</li>
          <li><strong>Industrial estate / business park</strong> &mdash; much cheaper rent, more space, and good road access. Suitable for manufacturing, warehousing, and trade businesses that do not need passing customers.</li>
          <li><strong>Suburban / residential area</strong> &mdash; moderate costs, convenient for local services like dentists, convenience stores, or takeaways.</li>
          <li><strong>Rural area</strong> &mdash; lowest costs, but limited footfall and potentially harder to recruit staff or receive deliveries.</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">A business must balance the benefit of a high-footfall location against the higher fixed costs it demands. There is no point paying &pound;5,000 a month in city centre rent if the extra sales do not cover that cost.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n19">The Impact of the Internet on Location Decisions</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">The growth of <dfn class="term" data-def="Buying and selling goods or services over the internet.">e-commerce</dfn> has transformed where businesses need to be based. An online retailer does not need a high street shop with expensive rent &mdash; it can operate from a garage, a spare room, or a warehouse on a cheap industrial estate.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n21">Advantages of Selling Online</h3>

        <ul data-narration-id="n22">
          <li><strong>Lower fixed costs</strong> &mdash; no need for an expensive shop, which dramatically reduces rent, rates, and utility bills</li>
          <li><strong>Wider market reach</strong> &mdash; the business can sell to customers across the whole country or even globally, not just people who walk past the shop</li>
          <li><strong>Open 24/7</strong> &mdash; an online store never closes, so customers can browse and buy at any time</li>
          <li><strong>Location flexibility</strong> &mdash; the business can be based anywhere with an internet connection</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n23">Limitations of Selling Online</h3>

        <ul data-narration-id="n24">
          <li><strong>Warehouse and distribution</strong> &mdash; even online businesses need somewhere to store stock and a system for delivering it to customers. Warehouse costs and delivery charges still apply.</li>
          <li><strong>No physical experience</strong> &mdash; customers cannot touch, try, or see products before buying, which may increase returns</li>
          <li><strong>Competition</strong> &mdash; online markets are highly competitive because customers can compare prices instantly</li>
          <li><strong>Delivery expectations</strong> &mdash; customers expect fast, cheap delivery, which adds pressure to logistics costs</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n25">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>E-commerce means some businesses no longer need a physical shop at all. However, they still need warehouse space, a reliable delivery network, and strong online marketing. The internet has not eliminated the need for a location &mdash; it has changed <em>what kind</em> of location matters.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n26">Technology and Location</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n27">Advances in technology have made some businesses almost completely location-independent. Cloud computing means files and software can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. Video conferencing tools allow meetings without travel. Remote working lets employees work from home rather than commuting to an office.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n28">This is especially relevant for service-based businesses like web design, accounting, marketing, and consultancy. These businesses do not need to be near raw materials or a high street &mdash; their &ldquo;product&rdquo; is expertise, which can be delivered digitally.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n29">
          <li><strong>Cloud computing</strong> &mdash; eliminates the need for expensive on-site servers and allows staff to work from any location</li>
          <li><strong>Remote working</strong> &mdash; reduces the need for large, expensive office space in city centres</li>
          <li><strong>Social media marketing</strong> &mdash; allows businesses to reach customers without relying on physical footfall</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n30">However, not all businesses can go fully remote. A restaurant, hairdresser, or car mechanic still needs a physical premises where customers can visit.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n31">Consider two businesses selling handmade candles. <strong>CandleCraft</strong> rents a small shop on a busy high street for &pound;2,000 per month. It benefits from passing trade, impulse purchases, and customers who enjoy browsing and smelling the products in person. However, its market is limited to people in the local area, and rent is its biggest monthly expense.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n32"><strong>GlowBox</strong> sells identical candles online from a home workshop, with no shop rent. It uses Instagram and a website to attract customers nationwide. Its fixed costs are much lower &mdash; just website hosting, packaging, and postage. However, it must invest heavily in photography, social media marketing, and paid advertising to drive traffic. It also faces fierce online competition from hundreds of similar sellers.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n33">Neither model is automatically better. CandleCraft has higher fixed costs but a loyal local customer base. GlowBox has lower overheads but must work harder to stand out online. Many small businesses now use a <strong>hybrid model</strong> &mdash; selling in a physical shop <em>and</em> online &mdash; to get the best of both worlds.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Location questions almost always link to the <strong>type of business</strong> in the case study. A manufacturer needs different things from a retailer. Always explain <em>why</em> a particular location factor matters for <em>that specific business</em> &mdash; do not just list factors without connecting them to the context. For example, &ldquo;proximity to customers is important because this is a caf&eacute; that relies on footfall&rdquo; is much stronger than &ldquo;proximity to customers is important.&rdquo;</p>
      </div>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n35">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Business location is a balancing act between cost and convenience. The right choice depends on the type of business, its customers, and whether it operates online, in person, or both.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Four key factors:</strong> proximity to customers, materials/suppliers, labour, and competitors all influence where a business should locate.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost trade-off:</strong> high-footfall locations bring more customers but come with much higher fixed costs like rent and business rates.</li>
          <li><strong>Technology changes the rules:</strong> e-commerce and remote working mean many businesses no longer need an expensive high street presence, but physical location still matters for shops, restaurants, and manufacturers.</li>
        </ul>

Instead, it can sell through a website from a home office or cheap warehouse, which significantly reduces fixed costs such as rent and business rates (1). This makes it easier for a new business to start up because the owner needs less finance to cover overheads, and the savings can be reinvested into stock, marketing, or product development (1)."

If the business is in a remote location, it may struggle to attract enough qualified applicants, which could lead to vacancies and reduced output (1). For example, a technology company might locate near a university city to recruit skilled computer science graduates, giving it a competitive advantage through a more talented workforce (1)."

Being surrounded by other shops also attracts shoppers who are already in a buying mindset. However, city centre rent and business rates are very expensive \u2014 often several times higher than a suburban or out-of-town location. For a new business with limited finance, these high fixed costs could lead to cash-flow problems, especially in the early months when sales are still building. An alternative location like a retail park or suburban high street could offer a compromise: reasonable footfall at a much lower cost. Overall, a city centre location can be excellent for an established brand with strong sales, but it is risky for a new business that may not generate enough revenue to cover the high costs.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about city centre locations."

He is considering two locations: (A) a unit on a busy high street with monthly rent of \u00a33,500 and high footfall, or (B) operating as a delivery-only kitchen from an industrial estate unit with monthly rent of \u00a3800.\n\nJustify which location Marco should choose.",
        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: The high street unit would give Marco immediate visibility and passing trade. Customers could see the pizza being made, smell the food, and make impulse purchases. This builds brand recognition quickly and does not rely on a delivery platform. However, the rent is \u00a33,500 per month \u2014 more than four times the industrial estate option. As a new business, Marco may not generate enough sales in the early months to cover this cost, which could cause serious cash-flow problems. The delivery-only kitchen on the industrial estate costs just \u00a3800 per month, which dramatically reduces his break-even point. He could list on delivery apps like Deliveroo and Just Eat to reach customers across the whole city without needing footfall. However, he would be completely dependent on these platforms, which charge commission of 25\u201335% per order. He would also have no walk-in trade and would need to invest in online marketing to build awareness. On balance, Marco should start with the delivery-only kitchen. The lower rent reduces his financial risk as a start-up, and delivery apps give him instant access to a large customer base. Once the business is established and generating steady profits, he could then consider moving to a high street location or adding a second site.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
