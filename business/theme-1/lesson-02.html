        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The Purpose of Business Activity</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Every business exists for a reason. At its core, the purpose of all business activity is to produce <dfn class="term" data-def="Physical items made by a business, such as cars, food, or clothing.">goods</dfn> or provide <dfn class="term" data-def="Non-physical activities sold by a business, such as haircuts, insurance, or web design.">services</dfn> that meet customer needs. Without customers willing to pay, a business cannot survive.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">Customer needs go beyond just wanting a product. Customers look for the right combination of <strong>price</strong>, <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>choice</strong>, and <strong>convenience</strong>. A successful business identifies which of these matters most to its target customers and delivers it better than competitors.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n4">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The four main customer needs are <strong>price</strong> (affordable), <strong>quality</strong> (fit for purpose), <strong>choice</strong> (range of options), and <strong>convenience</strong> (easy to access and buy). Different customers prioritise different needs &mdash; budget shoppers focus on price, while luxury buyers focus on quality.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n5">What Is Adding Value?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n6"><dfn class="term" data-def="The process of increasing the worth of a product or service so customers are willing to pay more than the cost of the inputs.">Adding value</dfn> is the process of increasing the worth of raw materials or bought-in components so that customers are willing to pay more for the finished product than it cost to make. It is the difference between the selling price and the cost of the materials or inputs used.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n7">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p><strong>Added value = selling price &minus; cost of bought-in materials and components.</strong> For example, a sandwich shop buys bread, cheese, and ham for &pound;1.20 and sells the sandwich for &pound;3.50. The added value is &pound;2.30. This &pound;2.30 must cover wages, rent, and other costs &mdash; whatever is left over is profit.</p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">Adding value is essential because it allows a business to cover its costs and make a profit. Without adding value, there is no reason for the business to exist &mdash; customers could just buy the raw materials themselves. The more value a business adds, the more it can charge and the higher its potential profit.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n9">How Businesses Add Value</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">There are several ways a business can add value to its products or services:</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n11">Branding</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n12"><dfn class="term" data-def="A name, logo, or image that distinguishes a product from its competitors and creates customer loyalty.">Branding</dfn> creates a recognisable identity that customers trust and are willing to pay more for. A plain white T-shirt might cost &pound;5 to make, but with a Nike or Adidas logo it can sell for &pound;30 or more. The product is essentially the same, but the brand adds perceived value. Strong branding also builds customer loyalty, meaning repeat purchases.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n13">Quality</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">Using better materials or higher standards of craftsmanship allows businesses to charge premium prices. A handmade leather bag lasts longer and feels better than a mass-produced alternative. Customers who value durability and quality will pay more, increasing the added value.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n15">Design</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n16">Attractive, innovative, or functional <dfn class="term" data-def="The way a product looks, feels, and works, which can make it more appealing to customers.">design</dfn> makes products more desirable. Apple charges premium prices partly because of its sleek, minimalist product design. Good design can also improve usability &mdash; a well-designed app is easier to use, making customers more willing to pay for it.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n17">Convenience</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n18"><dfn class="term" data-def="Making a product or service easier for customers to access, buy, or use.">Convenience</dfn> means making it easier for customers to buy or use a product. A corner shop charges more than a supermarket for the same bottle of milk, but customers pay the extra because it saves them a 20-minute drive. Online delivery, longer opening hours, and click-and-collect services all add value through convenience.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n19">Unique Selling Point (USP)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">A <dfn class="term" data-def="A feature or combination of features that makes a business stand out from competitors.">unique selling point</dfn> is something that makes a product different from everything else on the market. It could be a patented feature, a secret recipe, or an exclusive service. Dyson&rsquo;s bagless cyclone technology was a USP that allowed the company to charge far more than traditional vacuum cleaners. A strong USP gives customers a reason to choose your product over a cheaper rival.</p>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n21">Pret A Manger buys ingredients like bread, avocados, and coffee beans &mdash; all cheap raw materials. But a Pret sandwich sells for &pound;4&ndash;&pound;6, and a coffee for &pound;3&ndash;&pound;4. How?</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n22">Pret adds value through multiple methods simultaneously. <strong>Convenience</strong> &mdash; freshly made food ready to grab on a lunch break. <strong>Quality</strong> &mdash; fresh ingredients prepared daily, with unsold food donated to charity. <strong>Branding</strong> &mdash; the distinctive red star logo and reputation for natural food. <strong>Design</strong> &mdash; clean, attractive stores that feel welcoming. Each method increases how much customers are willing to pay beyond the cost of the raw ingredients.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n23">Why Adding Value Matters</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">Adding value is not optional &mdash; it is what separates a business from a simple reseller. Businesses that add more value can:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n25">
          <li><strong>Charge higher prices</strong> &mdash; customers pay more when they see extra worth in the product</li>
          <li><strong>Increase profit margins</strong> &mdash; higher selling prices with similar costs means more profit per unit</li>
          <li><strong>Stand out from competitors</strong> &mdash; value-added features create differentiation in crowded markets</li>
          <li><strong>Build customer loyalty</strong> &mdash; strong branding and quality keep customers coming back</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n26">Businesses that fail to add value compete on price alone. This is a dangerous position because there is always someone willing to sell cheaper, which drives down profits for everyone.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n27">The Role of the Entrepreneur</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n28">An <dfn class="term" data-def="A person who takes the financial risk of starting and running a new business.">entrepreneur</dfn> is the driving force behind a business. Their role involves three key activities:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n29">
          <li><strong>Organising resources</strong> &mdash; bringing together the land, labour, capital, and enterprise needed to run the business. This means finding premises, hiring staff, securing finance, and sourcing materials.</li>
          <li><strong>Making business decisions</strong> &mdash; choosing what to produce, how to produce it, what price to charge, and how to market the product. Every decision carries risk.</li>
          <li><strong>Taking risks</strong> &mdash; investing personal time, money, and effort with no guarantee of success. If the business fails, the entrepreneur may lose everything they invested.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n30">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>The entrepreneur&rsquo;s role is to combine the four <dfn class="term" data-def="The inputs needed to produce goods and services: land, labour, capital, and enterprise.">factors of production</dfn> &mdash; <strong>land</strong> (natural resources and premises), <strong>labour</strong> (workers), <strong>capital</strong> (money and equipment), and <strong>enterprise</strong> (the entrepreneur&rsquo;s own risk-taking and decision-making) &mdash; to create a product or service that adds value.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n31">Paul Lindley founded Ella&rsquo;s Kitchen in 2006 after struggling to get his daughter Ella to eat healthy food. He spotted a gap in the market for organic baby food in fun, squeezable pouches &mdash; a combination of <strong>quality</strong> (organic ingredients), <strong>design</strong> (colourful pouches children could hold), and <strong>convenience</strong> (no spoon needed).</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n32">Lindley organised resources by partnering with organic farms for ingredients and contracting manufacturers for the pouches. He risked his savings and remortgaged his house to fund the launch. By 2013, Ella&rsquo;s Kitchen was the UK&rsquo;s number one baby food brand and was sold to Hain Celestial for over &pound;70 million. Lindley&rsquo;s entrepreneurial skills &mdash; spotting the gap, adding value, and taking the financial risk &mdash; turned a personal frustration into a hugely successful business.</p>

      <div class="exam-tip" data-narration-id="n33">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When asked about adding value, always link your answer to a specific method (branding, quality, design, convenience, or USP) and explain <em>how</em> it increases the price customers are willing to pay. Don&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;the business adds value&rdquo; &mdash; show the chain: method &rarr; why customers pay more &rarr; impact on the business (e.g. higher profit).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n34">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Adding value is the core of what businesses do. By transforming inputs into something customers value more, businesses can charge higher prices, cover their costs, and generate profit. Entrepreneurs drive this process by organising resources, making decisions, and taking risks.</p>

          <li><strong>Added value = selling price &minus; cost of inputs.</strong> The bigger the gap, the more room for profit.</li>
          <li><strong>Five methods:</strong> branding, quality, design, convenience, and USP each allow businesses to charge more than their costs.</li>
          <li><strong>Entrepreneurs create value</strong> by combining factors of production and taking the risk that customers will pay for the result.</li>
        </ul>

This creates a larger gap between revenue and costs, giving the business a bigger profit margin (1). A higher profit margin means the business is more likely to cover its overheads such as rent and wages, which increases its chances of surviving the difficult first year (1)."

        marks: "Award up to 6 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Detailed discussion of branding AND at least one other method with developed reasoning and a judgement.\nExample: Branding is important because it creates customer recognition and loyalty. A strong brand, like Innocent Drinks, allows a business to charge premium prices because customers trust the product. However, for a small start-up with limited funds, building a brand takes time and money. Other methods like convenience or quality may be more immediately effective \u2014 a local bakery adds value through the quality of its freshly baked bread, not its brand name. Overall, branding is important in the long term, but in the early stages a small business may benefit more from focusing on quality or convenience, which can add value without requiring a large marketing budget.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about branding or adding value."

        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: The rebranding would give Marco\u2019s coffee shop a more professional image and help it stand out from competitors on the high street. New signage could attract passing customers who might otherwise walk past, and branded cups create free advertising when commuters carry them onto the train. However, a rebrand does not change the product itself \u2014 if the coffee and service are already good, a new logo alone may not increase sales enough to justify \u00a35,000. The mobile ordering app would add value through convenience, which is especially important for Marco\u2019s location near a train station. Commuters are time-pressed and would pay a premium to order ahead and skip the queue. The app could also collect customer data for targeted promotions. On balance, Marco should invest in the mobile app because his location near a station means convenience is the most valued feature for his core customers. The app directly increases how many customers he can serve during peak commuting hours, which will have a bigger impact on revenue than a visual rebrand.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
