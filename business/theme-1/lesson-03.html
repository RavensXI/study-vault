        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Understanding Customer Needs</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">A business can only succeed if it gives customers what they want. <dfn class="term" data-def="The desires and requirements of customers that a business tries to satisfy.">Customer needs</dfn> are the things people look for when choosing a product or service. Understanding these needs is the starting point for every business decision.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">The four main customer needs are:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n4">
          <li><strong>Price</strong> &mdash; customers want value for money. Some prioritise the cheapest option; others will pay more if they see extra value.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality</strong> &mdash; the product must be fit for purpose. A cheap umbrella that breaks in the first storm does not meet the customer&rsquo;s quality need.</li>
          <li><strong>Choice</strong> &mdash; customers want options. Different sizes, colours, flavours, or service levels let them find something that matches their preferences.</li>
          <li><strong>Convenience</strong> &mdash; how easy it is to find, buy, and use the product. Online ordering, home delivery, and long opening hours all improve convenience.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n5">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p>Identifying customer needs is critical for two reasons: it <strong>generates sales</strong> (customers buy products that meet their needs) and it ensures <strong>business survival</strong> (businesses that ignore customer needs lose customers to competitors). A business that does not understand its customers will fail.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n6">What Is Market Research?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n7"><dfn class="term" data-def="The process of gathering, analysing, and interpreting information about a market, including customer preferences and competitor activity.">Market research</dfn> is the process of gathering information about customers, competitors, and the market. It helps a business understand what people want, how much they are willing to pay, and what competitors are already offering.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n8">Why Do Businesses Conduct Market Research?</h3>

        <ul data-narration-id="n9">
          <li><strong>To identify and understand customer needs</strong> &mdash; what do customers actually want? What features matter most?</li>
          <li><strong>To identify gaps in the market</strong> &mdash; is there a product or service that customers want but nobody is currently offering?</li>
          <li><strong>To reduce risk</strong> &mdash; launching a product without research is gambling. Research gives evidence that there is demand before investing money.</li>
          <li><strong>To inform business decisions</strong> &mdash; research helps with pricing, location, promotion, and product design decisions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n10">Methods of Market Research</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">Market research is divided into two main types: <dfn class="term" data-def="New data collected first-hand by the business for a specific purpose.">primary research</dfn> (original data you collect yourself) and <dfn class="term" data-def="Data that already exists, having been collected by someone else for a different purpose.">secondary research</dfn> (data that already exists).</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n12">Primary Research (Field Research)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">Primary research is data collected first-hand by the business for a specific purpose. Common methods include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n14">
          <li><strong>Surveys and questionnaires</strong> &mdash; a set of questions asked to a sample of potential customers, either online, by phone, or face-to-face. Cheap and can reach many people, but responses may be biased or dishonest.</li>
          <li><strong>Focus groups</strong> &mdash; a small group of people discussing a product or idea in depth. Gives detailed, qualitative feedback but is time-consuming and may not represent the wider market.</li>
          <li><strong>Observation</strong> &mdash; watching customer behaviour, such as counting footfall past a potential shop location or tracking which products customers pick up. Objective but doesn&rsquo;t explain <em>why</em> customers behave that way.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n15">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact</div>
          <p><strong>Primary research</strong> is specific to the business and up to date, but it is expensive and time-consuming to collect. <strong>Secondary research</strong> is quick and cheap, but it may be outdated or not specific enough to the business&rsquo;s needs.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n16">Secondary Research (Desk Research)</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">Secondary research uses data that has already been collected by someone else. Sources include:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n18">
          <li><strong>Internet research</strong> &mdash; competitor websites, online reviews, social media trends. Free and fast, but reliability varies.</li>
          <li><strong>Market reports</strong> &mdash; published by companies like Mintel or Statista, these give detailed analysis of specific industries. Reliable but expensive.</li>
          <li><strong>Government reports</strong> &mdash; the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes data on population, spending habits, and economic trends. Free and reliable, but very general.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n19">Types of Data</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">Market research produces two types of data:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n21">
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="Data based on numbers and statistics, such as sales figures or percentages.">Quantitative data</dfn></strong> &mdash; numerical data that can be measured and analysed statistically. &ldquo;72% of customers prefer online ordering&rdquo; is quantitative. It is objective and easy to compare, but it doesn&rsquo;t explain the reasons behind the numbers.</li>
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="Data based on opinions, feelings, and experiences, usually collected through interviews or focus groups.">Qualitative data</dfn></strong> &mdash; descriptive data about opinions, feelings, and experiences. &ldquo;Customers said the packaging felt cheap&rdquo; is qualitative. It gives depth and insight, but it is harder to analyse and may be subjective.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n22">The Role of Social Media in Market Research</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">Social media has transformed market research. Businesses can monitor customer opinions in real time by tracking comments, reviews, likes, and shares. Instagram polls, Twitter threads, and Facebook groups all provide free qualitative and quantitative data. The advantage is speed and cost; the risk is that social media users may not represent the full target market.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n24">Reliability of Market Research Data</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n25">Not all data is equally useful. <dfn class="term" data-def="The extent to which research data can be trusted to give an accurate picture of the market.">Reliability</dfn> depends on several factors:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n26">
          <li><strong>Sample size</strong> &mdash; asking 10 people is less reliable than asking 1,000</li>
          <li><strong>Bias</strong> &mdash; leading questions or unrepresentative samples distort results</li>
          <li><strong>Age of data</strong> &mdash; consumer trends change quickly; data from two years ago may be outdated</li>
          <li><strong>Source</strong> &mdash; government statistics are more reliable than a random blog post</li>
        </ul>

              <p data-narration-id="n27">Gymshark was founded by Ben Francis in 2012 from his parents&rsquo; garage. Instead of expensive market reports, Francis used social media as his primary research tool. He monitored fitness communities on Instagram and YouTube to understand what gym-goers wanted: functional, well-fitting workout clothes at a mid-range price point.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n28">He sent free products to fitness influencers and tracked engagement &mdash; which designs got the most likes, comments, and shares. This real-time qualitative data shaped product development. By 2020, Gymshark was valued at over &pound;1 billion. Francis used social media not just for promotion but as a continuous market research tool, constantly adapting products based on customer feedback.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Questions about market research often ask you to evaluate a specific method. Always give an advantage AND a disadvantage, and link your answer to the type of business in the question. A multinational can afford Mintel reports; a start-up probably cannot. Context matters.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n30">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Understanding customer needs and conducting market research are the foundations of every successful business. Research reduces the risk of failure by providing evidence for decisions, whether that evidence comes from surveys, social media, or government data.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Four customer needs:</strong> price, quality, choice, and convenience. Successful businesses identify which matters most to their target market.</li>
          <li><strong>Primary vs secondary:</strong> primary research is specific but costly; secondary research is cheap but may not fit your exact needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Data reliability:</strong> always consider sample size, bias, age, and source when using market research data to make decisions.</li>

This means the entrepreneur can see if enough customers would actually buy the product to cover costs (1). As a result, the business avoids investing money in a product nobody wants, which reduces the risk of financial loss and failure (1)."

Businesses can monitor comments, likes, and shares to instantly see how people react to a new product or idea (1). This allows the business to make quick changes to its products or marketing before investing heavily, saving both time and money compared to traditional research methods (1)."

This means decisions are based on relevant, up-to-date data. However, primary research is expensive and time-consuming, which is a significant problem for a start-up with limited funds. Secondary research such as government statistics or free online data is much cheaper and quicker to access. While it may not be perfectly tailored, it can still provide useful background information about market size and trends. Overall, a new business should use a combination of both: secondary research to understand the broader market cheaply, then targeted primary research on the most critical questions.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Some discussion with limited development.\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic points about primary or secondary research."

        marks: "Award up to 9 marks using a levels-based approach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Thorough analysis and evaluation of both options with a justified recommendation supported by the context.\nExample: The online survey would give Zara quantitative data from a large sample of 1,000 local residents. She could find out how many people would buy vegan baked goods, what prices they would pay, and what products they want. This data is statistically reliable because of the large sample size. However, people may say they would buy vegan products in a survey but never actually do so \u2014 survey responses don\u2019t always match real behaviour. The pop-up stall would give Zara real sales data: she would see which products people actually buy, at what price, and get face-to-face qualitative feedback. She could observe customer reactions and have conversations about what they liked or disliked. However, the sample is much smaller \u2014 only people who happen to visit the market. On balance, Zara should choose the pop-up stall because it provides the most reliable evidence: actual sales rather than hypothetical survey answers. For a food business, letting customers taste the product is the most convincing form of research. She can also use the pop-up to build early brand awareness before opening the bakery.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Some analysis of both options with limited evaluation.\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic points about one or both options."
