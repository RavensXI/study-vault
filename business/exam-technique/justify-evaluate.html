        <h2>What the Examiner Wants</h2>
        <p>This is the highest-value question on the paper and the one that separates the top grades. The examiner wants you to <strong>weigh up options, factors, or strategies</strong> and make a <strong>supported judgement</strong>. &ldquo;Justify&rdquo; means recommend and defend a choice. &ldquo;Evaluate&rdquo; means judge how important, successful, or effective something is. Both require analysis of multiple sides and a clear final position.</p>

              <p>Priya wants to open a caf&eacute;. She is deciding between renting a unit on the high street or a cheaper location on a side street two minutes away. Justify which location Priya should choose. [9 marks]</p>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-model-paragraph">
              <span class="guide-annotation">Argument for the high street</span>
              <p>The high street location would give Priya much higher footfall. Customers who are already shopping are more likely to notice a caf&eacute; and walk in without planning to, which means Priya would benefit from impulse purchases. For a new caf&eacute; with no established reputation, being visible is crucial because Priya cannot yet rely on loyal customers or word-of-mouth. Higher footfall would lead to more customers from day one, increasing her revenue and helping the business break even faster.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-model-paragraph">
              <span class="guide-annotation">Argument for the side street</span>
              <p>However, the side-street location is cheaper, which would reduce Priya&rsquo;s fixed costs. Lower rent means her break-even point would be lower &mdash; she would need fewer customers to cover her costs. This is important for a new business because cash flow is often tight in the early months, and many start-ups fail because they run out of cash rather than because their product is bad. The money saved on rent could be invested in marketing or better equipment, which might attract customers despite the less visible location.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-model-paragraph">
              <span class="guide-annotation">Justified conclusion</span>
              <p>I would recommend Priya chooses the side-street location. Although the high street offers better footfall, Priya is a new business with limited finance, and the risk of high fixed costs is a bigger threat to her survival than lower visibility. She could compensate for the quieter location by investing the money saved on rent into social media marketing and a distinctive shop front to draw customers in. A caf&eacute; two minutes from the high street is still conveniently located, and once Priya builds a reputation through good food and service, customers will seek her out regardless of location. Keeping costs low gives the business the best chance of surviving its first year.</p>

              <p><strong>Examiner:</strong> 9/9 (Level 3) &mdash; both options thoroughly analysed with developed chains of reasoning. Conclusion is clearly justified with reference to Priya&rsquo;s specific situation and acknowledges the other side.</p>

              <p>Evaluate whether social media is the most important factor in the success of a new online clothing business. [12 marks]</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Level 1 Answer (1&ndash;4 marks)</h3>
            <div class="guide-model-paragraph guide-weak-answer">
              <span class="guide-annotation guide-annotation-weak">Lists points, no chain of reasoning</span>
              <p>Social media is good because lots of people use it. The business can post pictures of clothes. Customers can share posts. It is cheap compared to TV adverts. But not everyone uses social media. Some older people prefer to shop in stores.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Level 3 Answer (9&ndash;12 marks)</h3>
            <div class="guide-model-paragraph">
              <span class="guide-annotation">Developed chain + context</span>
              <p>Social media is arguably the most important factor for a new online clothing business because it directly drives both awareness and sales. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok allow the business to showcase products visually, which is essential for clothing where appearance drives purchasing decisions. Social media advertising can also be precisely targeted to the business&rsquo;s ideal customer demographic, meaning marketing spend is more efficient than traditional advertising. For a start-up with limited funds, this cost-effective reach could be the difference between attracting enough customers to survive and running out of cash.</p>
            </div>

            <p><em>A full Level 3 answer would continue with a counter-argument (e.g. product quality, pricing, or website design could matter more) and a conclusion evaluating the relative importance of social media versus other factors.</em></p>

      <!-- Common Mistakes -->

        <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
        <ul class="guide-mistakes">
          <li class="guide-mistake">
            <span class="guide-mistake-icon">&#10060;</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Ignoring the case study</strong> &mdash; This is the biggest mistake. The examiner specifically designs these questions around a scenario. Generic answers that never mention the business, its situation, or the figures given cannot reach Level 3. Always use names, details, and numbers from the case study.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="guide-mistake">
            <span class="guide-mistake-icon">&#10060;</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Weak conclusion</strong> &mdash; &ldquo;Overall it depends on the situation&rdquo; is not a conclusion. You must commit to a position and explain why, using evidence from your analysis. The conclusion is where the highest marks live.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="guide-mistake">
            <span class="guide-mistake-icon">&#10060;</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Only analysing one side</strong> &mdash; A one-sided answer &mdash; no matter how well-developed &mdash; cannot reach the top of Level 3. You must show the examiner you can see both sides before making a judgement.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="guide-mistake">
            <span class="guide-mistake-icon">&#10060;</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Running out of time</strong> &mdash; This is the last question and the one worth the most marks. Do NOT let earlier questions eat into this time. If you&rsquo;re running low, skip back to unfinished short questions afterwards. Always attempt the full Justify/Evaluate.
