        <h2>The 1920s Economic Boom</h2>

        <p>In the 1920s, the USA saw rapid economic growth known as the &lsquo;Boom.&rsquo; Mass production, hire purchase, and new advertising fuelled a consumer society that changed American life. The decade became the &lsquo;Roaring Twenties&rsquo; as many Americans enjoyed new prosperity and optimism.</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_cycle_of_prosperity.png" alt="Cycle of Prosperity diagram showing the reinforcing loop of mass production, lower prices, hire purchase, advertising, more demand, and higher wages that drove the 1920s American economic boom">
        </figure>

        <h2>Why Did the US Economy Boom?</h2>

        <h3>Republican Government Policies</h3>
        <p>The Republican presidents &mdash; <strong>Warren Harding</strong> (1921&ndash;1923), <strong>Calvin Coolidge</strong> (1923&ndash;1929), and <strong>Herbert Hoover</strong> (1929&ndash;1933) &mdash; believed in <strong>laissez-faire</strong>: the government should stay out of the economy. They kept taxes low and introduced <strong>tariffs</strong> (taxes on imported goods) to protect American businesses. The <strong>Fordney-McCumber Tariff</strong> of 1922 raised import duties to their highest levels, making foreign goods more expensive and pushing Americans to buy home-produced products.</p>

        <h3>New Industries and Mass Production</h3>
        <p>New consumer goods &mdash; cars, radios, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, washing machines &mdash; were produced on a huge scale. New materials like <strong>plastics</strong> made it cheaper to manufacture everyday items, from combs and buttons to radio casings. <strong>Henry Ford</strong> pioneered the <strong>assembly line</strong> at his Detroit factories. His <strong>Model T</strong> car &mdash; nicknamed the <strong>&lsquo;Tin Lizzie&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; took 12 hours to build in 1913 but just <strong>93 minutes</strong> by the mid-1920s. The key was <strong>standardisation</strong>: every Model T was identical, with only one colour (black) and one engine size. As Ford famously said, <strong>&ldquo;A customer can have any colour he likes so long as it&rsquo;s black.&rdquo;</strong> Standardised parts meant fewer skilled workers were needed, cutting wage costs dramatically. The price fell from <strong>$1,200 in 1909</strong> to just <strong>$295 by 1928</strong>, making it affordable for ordinary families. By 1929, Ford was producing more than <strong>one car every three minutes</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Henry Ford</div>
          <p>Ford&rsquo;s assembly line transformed American manufacturing. He paid workers <strong>$5 a day</strong> &mdash; double the average wage &mdash; and introduced the <strong>five-day working week</strong>, which was revolutionary at the time. He also paid <strong>Black workers the same as white workers</strong>. Well-paid workers becoming consumers helped drive the wider boom. However, Ford refused to allow <strong>trade unions</strong>, the hours were long with few breaks, and he used intimidation against workers who complained. At his vast <strong>Rouge River plant</strong>, <strong>81,000 men</strong> worked in a single factory by 1929.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Motor Car Industry</h3>
        <p>The car industry had a huge <strong>knock-on effect</strong> on the economy &mdash; often called the <strong>&lsquo;Cycle of Prosperity.&rsquo;</strong> Car production consumed <strong>20% of America&rsquo;s steel</strong>, <strong>80% of its rubber</strong>, <strong>75% of its plate glass</strong>, and <strong>65% of its leather</strong>. By the end of the 1920s, American cars were using <strong>seven billion gallons of petrol a year</strong>, making oil-producing states like <strong>Texas</strong> wealthy. New roads, highways, petrol stations, motels, and roadside restaurants sprang up, creating thousands more jobs. Suburbs grew as people drove to work. By 1929, motor manufacturing was America&rsquo;s biggest industry, employing hundreds of thousands directly and millions more in related trades. In Europe, cars were still a luxury for the rich &mdash; in America, they were becoming an everyday item.</p>

        <h3>Hire Purchase</h3>
        <p>Americans could now buy expensive goods on <strong>credit</strong> &mdash; known as <strong>hire purchase</strong> or &lsquo;buying on the instalment plan.&rsquo; They paid a small deposit, then monthly payments. By 1929, <strong>60% of cars</strong> and <strong>80% of radios</strong> were bought this way. Easy credit boosted spending and demand.</p>

        <h3>Advertising</h3>
        <p>New advertising on <strong>radio, billboards, newspapers, and magazines</strong> pushed Americans to buy the latest products. Advertisers created a culture of <strong>consumerism</strong>, making people feel they needed the newest goods to keep up with their neighbours. <strong>Mail-order catalogues</strong> brought consumer goods to rural families who lived far from shops, spreading the boom beyond the cities. By 1929, over <strong>10 million radios</strong> sat in American homes.</p>

        <h3>The Stock Market</h3>
        <p>Many Americans bought <strong>shares</strong> (stocks) in companies, hoping for quick profits as prices rose. This was called <strong>speculation</strong>. Some bought &lsquo;on the margin&rsquo; &mdash; borrowing money to invest. The rising stock market created a sense of confidence, and millions believed the boom would last forever.</p>

        <h3>Natural Resources and WWI</h3>
        <p>The USA had vast <strong>natural resources</strong> &mdash; oil, coal, and iron &mdash; which fuelled industrial growth. During <strong>World War One</strong>, the USA lent money to European countries and sold them weapons and supplies. After the war, European economies were weak, letting America dominate world trade. The USA had also taken over markets that Europe used to supply.</p>

        <h2>Who Benefited from the Boom?</h2>

        <p>The boom did not help everyone equally. Winners included:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Businessmen and industrialists</strong> &mdash; factory and company owners saw profits soar.</li>
          <li><strong>Workers in new industries</strong> like cars, electrical goods, and construction &mdash; higher wages and better living standards.</li>
          <li><strong>City dwellers</strong> &mdash; access to new consumer goods, entertainment, and jobs.</li>
          <li><strong>Stock market speculators</strong> &mdash; profits as share prices kept rising.</li>
          <li><strong>Middle-class families</strong> &mdash; could afford cars, radios, and refrigerators on hire purchase.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who Did NOT Benefit?</h2>

        <p>Many Americans were left behind. The prosperity of the &lsquo;Roaring Twenties&rsquo; was very uneven:</p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Farmers:</strong> Overproduction meant crop prices collapsed. During WWI, farmers had expanded to feed Europe, but after the war demand fell. Around <strong>600,000 farmers</strong> lost their farms, and farm income dropped from $22 billion (1919) to $13 billion (1928).</p>
              <p><strong>African Americans:</strong> Most lived in the South as <strong>sharecroppers</strong>, trapped in poverty and debt. They faced <strong>Jim Crow</strong> segregation and violence from the <strong>Ku Klux Klan</strong>. Even in northern cities, they got the lowest-paid, most dangerous jobs and lived in overcrowded ghettos.</p>
              <p><strong>Native Americans:</strong> The poorest group in 1920s America. They lived on <strong>reservations</strong> with limited education, healthcare, and jobs. Life expectancy was far lower than for white Americans.</p>
              <p><strong>Workers in old industries:</strong> <strong>Coal, textiles, and leather</strong> struggled against new materials and technologies. Coal demand fell as oil and electricity grew. Textile workers saw wages cut as factories moved south for cheaper labour.</p>
              <p><strong>Recent immigrants:</strong> Many worked low-paid, dangerous jobs and faced hostility. Immigration laws in <strong>1921 and 1924</strong> severely restricted who could enter the country.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Hidden Poverty</div>
          <p>Despite the image of prosperity, around <strong>42% of Americans</strong> lived below the poverty line in 1929. The richest <strong>5%</strong> received about <strong>33%</strong> of all income. Millions could not afford the consumer goods being produced &mdash; a weakness that would help cause the crash.</p>

        <p>Always discuss <strong>both sides</strong> of the boom. The examiner wants to see you understand it was not shared equally. Give <strong>specific examples and statistics</strong> for who benefited and who was left behind. Link the causes together &mdash; mass production cut prices, hire purchase made goods affordable, and advertising drove demand higher.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1920s Boom was driven by new industries, mass production, easy credit, advertising, and pro-business government policies. It created a new consumer culture and huge optimism. But the prosperity was deeply uneven &mdash; farmers, African Americans, Native Americans, and workers in old industries were largely left out. This inequality, along with over-reliance on credit and speculation, set the stage for the 1929 crash.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple causes:</strong> Republican policies, mass production, hire purchase, advertising, and WWI all combined &mdash; no single factor explains the boom alone.</li>
          <li><strong>Unequal prosperity:</strong> Around 42% of Americans still lived below the poverty line. Farmers, African Americans, and old-industry workers missed out.</li>
          <li><strong>Fragile foundations:</strong> The boom rested on credit, speculation, and overproduction &mdash; weaknesses that would cause economic disaster.</li>
