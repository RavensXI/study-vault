        <h2>The 1920s Economic Boom</h2>

        <p>In the 1920s, the USA experienced a period of rapid economic growth known as the &lsquo;Boom.&rsquo; Mass production, hire purchase, and new advertising techniques fuelled a consumer society that transformed American life. The decade became known as the &lsquo;Roaring Twenties&rsquo; as many Americans enjoyed a new era of prosperity and optimism.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Scale of Growth</div>
          <p>Between 1920 and 1929, the US economy grew rapidly. Industrial production nearly doubled, and the USA was producing <strong>42% of the world&rsquo;s goods</strong> by the end of the decade. By 1929, there were <strong>26 million cars</strong> registered in the USA &mdash; roughly one for every five Americans.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Did the US Economy Boom?</h2>

        <p>Several factors combined to create the economic boom of the 1920s:</p>

        <h3>Republican Government Policies</h3>
        <p>The Republican presidents of the 1920s &mdash; <strong>Warren Harding</strong> (1921&ndash;1923), <strong>Calvin Coolidge</strong> (1923&ndash;1929), and <strong>Herbert Hoover</strong> (1929&ndash;1933) &mdash; believed in <strong>laissez-faire</strong>, the idea that the government should interfere as little as possible in the economy. They kept taxes low and introduced <strong>tariffs</strong> (taxes on imported foreign goods) to protect American businesses from overseas competition. The <strong>Fordney-McCumber Tariff</strong> of 1922 raised import duties to their highest levels, making foreign goods more expensive and encouraging Americans to buy home-produced products.</p>

        <h3>New Industries and Mass Production</h3>
        <p>New consumer goods like cars, radios, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and washing machines were produced on a massive scale. <strong>Henry Ford</strong> pioneered the <strong>assembly line</strong> at his factories in Detroit, revolutionising manufacturing. His <strong>Model T</strong> car, which had taken 12 hours to build in 1913, could be produced in just <strong>93 minutes</strong> by the mid-1920s. This dramatically reduced costs, making the car affordable for ordinary Americans &mdash; by 1925 the price had fallen to just <strong>$260</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Henry Ford</div>
          <p>Henry Ford&rsquo;s assembly line method transformed American manufacturing. He also paid his workers <strong>$5 a day</strong> &mdash; double the average wage &mdash; so that they could afford to buy the very cars they were producing. This idea of well-paid workers becoming consumers helped drive the wider economic boom.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Motor Car Industry</h3>
        <p>The car industry had a huge <strong>knock-on effect</strong> on the rest of the economy. It stimulated demand for <strong>steel, glass, rubber, leather, and petrol</strong>. New roads, highways, petrol stations, motels, and roadside restaurants were built. Suburbs grew as people could now drive to work, opening up new areas for housing. By 1929, the motor industry was America&rsquo;s biggest industry, employing hundreds of thousands of workers directly and millions more in related industries.</p>

        <h3>Hire Purchase</h3>
        <p>Many Americans could now buy expensive goods on <strong>credit</strong> &mdash; known as <strong>hire purchase</strong> or &lsquo;buying on the instalment plan.&rsquo; Consumers paid a small deposit and then monthly payments to own goods they could not previously afford. By 1929, almost <strong>60% of cars</strong> and <strong>80% of radios</strong> were bought on hire purchase. This dramatically boosted consumer spending and demand for goods.</p>

        <h3>Advertising</h3>
        <p>New advertising techniques using <strong>radio, billboards, newspapers, and magazines</strong> convinced Americans to buy the latest products. Advertisers created a culture of <strong>consumerism</strong>, making people feel they needed the newest goods to keep up with their neighbours. Radio advertising was particularly powerful &mdash; by 1929 there were over <strong>10 million radios</strong> in American homes.</p>

        <h3>The Stock Market</h3>
        <p>Many Americans began buying <strong>shares</strong> (stocks) in companies, hoping to make quick profits as share prices rose. This was called <strong>speculation</strong>. Some even bought shares &lsquo;on the margin&rsquo; &mdash; borrowing money to invest. The rising stock market created a sense of confidence and wealth, and millions of Americans believed the boom would last forever.</p>

        <h3>Natural Resources and WWI</h3>
        <p>The USA had vast <strong>natural resources</strong> like oil, coal, and iron, which fuelled industrial growth. During <strong>World War One</strong>, the USA had lent money to European countries and sold them weapons and supplies. After the war, European economies were devastated and weak, allowing America to dominate world trade. The USA had also taken over markets previously supplied by European countries during the war years.</p>

        <h2>Who Benefited from the Boom?</h2>

        <p>The boom did not benefit everyone equally. Those who did well included:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Businessmen and industrialists</strong> who owned factories and companies saw their profits soar.</li>
          <li><strong>Workers in new industries</strong> like car manufacturing, electrical goods, and construction enjoyed higher wages and better living standards.</li>
          <li><strong>City dwellers</strong> who had access to new consumer goods, entertainment, and job opportunities.</li>
          <li><strong>Stock market speculators</strong> who made profits as share prices continued to rise through the decade.</li>
          <li><strong>Middle-class families</strong> who could afford cars, radios, refrigerators, and other new consumer goods on hire purchase.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who Did NOT Benefit?</h2>

        <p>Many Americans were left behind by the boom. The prosperity of the &lsquo;Roaring Twenties&rsquo; was very unevenly distributed:</p>

            <span>Groups left behind by the boom</span>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Farmers:</strong> Overproduction led to falling prices for crops. During WWI, farmers had expanded production to feed Europe, but after the war European farmers recovered and demand fell. Prices for wheat, corn, and cotton collapsed. Around <strong>600,000 farmers</strong> lost their farms during the 1920s, and farm income dropped from $22 billion in 1919 to just $13 billion in 1928.</p>
              <p><strong>African Americans:</strong> Most lived in the southern states and worked as <strong>sharecroppers</strong> on farms, trapped in a cycle of poverty and debt. They faced racial discrimination, segregation under <strong>Jim Crow laws</strong>, and the threat of violence from groups like the <strong>Ku Klux Klan</strong>. Even in northern cities, African Americans were often given the lowest-paid, most dangerous jobs and lived in overcrowded ghettos.</p>
              <p><strong>Native Americans:</strong> They were the poorest group in 1920s America, living on <strong>reservations</strong> with limited access to education, healthcare, and employment. Average life expectancy was significantly lower than for white Americans.</p>
              <p><strong>Workers in old industries:</strong> Industries like <strong>coal, textiles, and leather</strong> struggled to compete with new materials and technologies. Coal miners faced falling demand as oil and electricity became more popular. Textile workers in New England saw their wages cut as factories moved south to find cheaper labour.</p>
              <p><strong>Recent immigrants:</strong> Many worked in low-paid, dangerous jobs and faced discrimination and hostility. New immigration laws in <strong>1921 and 1924</strong> severely restricted the number of immigrants allowed into the country.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Hidden Poverty</div>
          <p>Despite the image of prosperity, in 1929 around <strong>42% of Americans</strong> lived below the poverty line. The richest <strong>5%</strong> of the population received approximately <strong>33%</strong> of all income. This massive inequality meant that millions could not afford to buy the consumer goods being produced, which would eventually contribute to the economic crash.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When writing about the 1920s Boom, always discuss <strong>both sides</strong>. The examiner wants to see that you understand the boom was not experienced equally. A strong answer will explain who benefited and who was left behind, with <strong>specific examples and statistics</strong>. Remember to link the causes together &mdash; for instance, explain how mass production led to lower prices, which combined with hire purchase made goods affordable, which boosted demand further.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1920s Boom was a period of remarkable economic growth driven by new industries, mass production, easy credit, advertising, and government policies that favoured business. It created a new consumer culture and a sense of unbounded optimism in America. However, the prosperity was deeply uneven &mdash; farmers, African Americans, Native Americans, and workers in older industries were largely excluded from the boom. This underlying inequality and over-reliance on credit and speculation would prove catastrophic when the economy crashed in 1929.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple causes:</strong> The boom was driven by a combination of Republican policies, mass production, new technology, hire purchase, advertising, and the impact of WWI &mdash; no single factor explains it alone.</li>
          <li><strong>Unequal prosperity:</strong> While the boom created great wealth for some, around 42% of Americans still lived below the poverty line. Farmers, African Americans, and workers in old industries did not share in the prosperity.</li>
          <li><strong>Fragile foundations:</strong> The boom rested on credit, speculation, and overproduction. When consumer spending slowed and confidence fell, these weaknesses would lead to economic disaster.</li>
        </ul>
