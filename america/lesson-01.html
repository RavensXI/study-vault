        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The 1920s Economic Boom</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">In the 1920s, the USA saw rapid economic growth known as the &lsquo;Boom.&rsquo; Mass production, hire purchase, and new advertising fuelled a consumer society that changed American life. The decade became the &lsquo;Roaring Twenties&rsquo; as many Americans enjoyed new prosperity and optimism.</p>

          <img src="diagram_cycle_of_prosperity.png" alt="Cycle of Prosperity diagram showing the reinforcing loop of mass production, lower prices, hire purchase, advertising, more demand, and higher wages that drove the 1920s American economic boom">
        </figure>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Why Did the US Economy Boom?</h2>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n5">Republican Government Policies</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n6">The Republican presidents &mdash; <strong>Warren Harding</strong> (1921&ndash;1923), <strong>Calvin Coolidge</strong> (1923&ndash;1929), and <strong>Herbert Hoover</strong> (1929&ndash;1933) &mdash; believed in <strong>laissez-faire</strong>: the government should stay out of the economy. They kept taxes low and introduced <strong>tariffs</strong> (taxes on imported goods) to protect American businesses. The <strong>Fordney-McCumber Tariff</strong> of 1922 raised import duties to their highest levels, making foreign goods more expensive and pushing Americans to buy home-produced products.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">New Industries and Mass Production</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n8">New consumer goods &mdash; cars, radios, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, washing machines &mdash; were produced on a huge scale. New materials like <strong>plastics</strong> made it cheaper to manufacture everyday items, from combs and buttons to radio casings. <strong>Henry Ford</strong> pioneered the <strong>assembly line</strong> at his Detroit factories. His <strong>Model T</strong> car &mdash; nicknamed the <strong>&lsquo;Tin Lizzie&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; took 12 hours to build in 1913 but just <strong>93 minutes</strong> by the mid-1920s. The key was <strong>standardisation</strong>: every Model T was identical, with only one colour (black) and one engine size. As Ford famously said, <strong>&ldquo;A customer can have any colour he likes so long as it&rsquo;s black.&rdquo;</strong> Standardised parts meant fewer skilled workers were needed, cutting wage costs dramatically. The price fell from <strong>$1,200 in 1909</strong> to just <strong>$295 by 1928</strong>, making it affordable for ordinary families. By 1929, Ford was producing more than <strong>one car every three minutes</strong>.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n9" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Henry Ford</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n10">Ford&rsquo;s assembly line transformed American manufacturing. He paid workers <strong>$5 a day</strong> &mdash; double the average wage &mdash; and introduced the <strong>five-day working week</strong>, which was revolutionary at the time. He also paid <strong>Black workers the same as white workers</strong>. Well-paid workers becoming consumers helped drive the wider boom. However, Ford refused to allow <strong>trade unions</strong>, the hours were long with few breaks, and he used intimidation against workers who complained. At his vast <strong>Rouge River plant</strong>, <strong>81,000 men</strong> worked in a single factory by 1929.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n11">The Motor Car Industry</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n12">The car industry had a huge <strong>knock-on effect</strong> on the economy &mdash; often called the <strong>&lsquo;Cycle of Prosperity.&rsquo;</strong> Car production consumed <strong>20% of America&rsquo;s steel</strong>, <strong>80% of its rubber</strong>, <strong>75% of its plate glass</strong>, and <strong>65% of its leather</strong>. By the end of the 1920s, American cars were using <strong>seven billion gallons of petrol a year</strong>, making oil-producing states like <strong>Texas</strong> wealthy. New roads, highways, petrol stations, motels, and roadside restaurants sprang up, creating thousands more jobs. Suburbs grew as people drove to work. By 1929, motor manufacturing was America&rsquo;s biggest industry, employing hundreds of thousands directly and millions more in related trades. In Europe, cars were still a luxury for the rich &mdash; in America, they were becoming an everyday item.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n13">Hire Purchase</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n14">Americans could now buy expensive goods on <strong>credit</strong> &mdash; known as <strong>hire purchase</strong> or &lsquo;buying on the instalment plan.&rsquo; They paid a small deposit, then monthly payments. By 1929, <strong>60% of cars</strong> and <strong>80% of radios</strong> were bought this way. Easy credit boosted spending and demand.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n15">Advertising</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n16">New advertising on <strong>radio, billboards, newspapers, and magazines</strong> pushed Americans to buy the latest products. Advertisers created a culture of <strong>consumerism</strong>, making people feel they needed the newest goods to keep up with their neighbours. <strong>Mail-order catalogues</strong> brought consumer goods to rural families who lived far from shops, spreading the boom beyond the cities. By 1929, over <strong>10 million radios</strong> sat in American homes.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n17">The Stock Market</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n18">Many Americans bought <strong>shares</strong> (stocks) in companies, hoping for quick profits as prices rose. This was called <strong>speculation</strong>. Some bought &lsquo;on the margin&rsquo; &mdash; borrowing money to invest. The rising stock market created a sense of confidence, and millions believed the boom would last forever.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n19">Natural Resources and WWI</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n20">The USA had vast <strong>natural resources</strong> &mdash; oil, coal, and iron &mdash; which fuelled industrial growth. During <strong>World War One</strong>, the USA lent money to European countries and sold them weapons and supplies. After the war, European economies were weak, letting America dominate world trade. The USA had also taken over markets that Europe used to supply.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n21">Who Benefited from the Boom?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n22">The boom did not help everyone equally. Winners included:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Businessmen and industrialists</strong> &mdash; factory and company owners saw profits soar.</li>
          <li><strong>Workers in new industries</strong> like cars, electrical goods, and construction &mdash; higher wages and better living standards.</li>
          <li><strong>City dwellers</strong> &mdash; access to new consumer goods, entertainment, and jobs.</li>
          <li><strong>Stock market speculators</strong> &mdash; profits as share prices kept rising.</li>
          <li><strong>Middle-class families</strong> &mdash; could afford cars, radios, and refrigerators on hire purchase.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n23">Who Did NOT Benefit?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">Many Americans were left behind. The prosperity of the &lsquo;Roaring Twenties&rsquo; was very uneven:</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n25"><strong>Farmers:</strong> Overproduction meant crop prices collapsed. During WWI, farmers had expanded to feed Europe, but after the war demand fell. Around <strong>600,000 farmers</strong> lost their farms, and farm income dropped from $22 billion (1919) to $13 billion (1928).</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n26"><strong>African Americans:</strong> Most lived in the South as <strong>sharecroppers</strong>, trapped in poverty and debt. They faced <strong>Jim Crow</strong> segregation and violence from the <strong>Ku Klux Klan</strong>. Even in northern cities, they got the lowest-paid, most dangerous jobs and lived in overcrowded ghettos.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n27"><strong>Native Americans:</strong> The poorest group in 1920s America. They lived on <strong>reservations</strong> with limited education, healthcare, and jobs. Life expectancy was far lower than for white Americans.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n28"><strong>Workers in old industries:</strong> <strong>Coal, textiles, and leather</strong> struggled against new materials and technologies. Coal demand fell as oil and electricity grew. Textile workers saw wages cut as factories moved south for cheaper labour.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n29"><strong>Recent immigrants:</strong> Many worked low-paid, dangerous jobs and faced hostility. Immigration laws in <strong>1921 and 1924</strong> severely restricted who could enter the country.</p>

The richest <strong>5%</strong> received about <strong>33%</strong> of all income. Millions could not afford the consumer goods being produced &mdash; a weakness that would help cause the crash.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n35">Conclusion</h2>
        <p data-narration-id="n36">The 1920s Boom was driven by new industries, mass production, easy credit, advertising, and pro-business government policies. It created a new consumer culture and huge optimism. But the prosperity was deeply uneven &mdash; farmers, African Americans, Native Americans, and workers in old industries were largely left out. This inequality, along with over-reliance on credit and speculation, set the stage for the 1929 crash.</p>
        <h3 data-narration-id="n37">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple causes:</strong> Republican policies, mass production, hire purchase, advertising, and WWI all combined &mdash; no single factor explains the boom alone.</li>
          <li><strong>Unequal prosperity:</strong> Around 42% of Americans still lived below the poverty line. Farmers, African Americans, and old-industry workers missed out.</li>
          <li><strong>Fragile foundations:</strong> The boom rested on credit, speculation, and overproduction &mdash; weaknesses that would cause economic disaster.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which Republican policies and mass production fuelled economic growth.\nExample: One cause was mass production. Henry Ford\u2019s assembly line cut the time to build a Model T from 12 hours to just 93 minutes. This slashed the price from $1,200 to $295, making cars affordable for ordinary families and boosting demand across the whole economy.\n\nAnother example: Republican government policies helped cause the boom. Presidents like Coolidge believed in laissez-faire and kept taxes low. The Fordney-McCumber Tariff (1922) raised duties on imports, making foreign goods expensive and encouraging Americans to buy home-produced products.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge. Students demonstrate relevant knowledge about the issue(s) identified.\nExample: Henry Ford used the assembly line to make cars cheaper.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which certain groups were excluded from prosperity.\nExample: Farmers did not benefit from the boom. Overproduction after World War One meant crop prices collapsed. Farm income dropped from $22 billion in 1919 to $13 billion by 1928, and around 600,000 farmers lost their farms during the decade.\n\nAnother example: African Americans were largely left behind. Most lived in the South as sharecroppers, trapped in poverty and debt. They faced Jim Crow segregation laws and violence from the Ku Klux Klan. Even in northern cities, they were given the lowest-paid, most dangerous jobs.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge. Students demonstrate relevant knowledge about the issue(s) identified.\nExample: Farmers were poor because crop prices fell.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: The boom transformed life for many Americans but its effects varied hugely by group. Middle-class city dwellers could now buy cars, radios, and refrigerators on hire purchase \u2014 by 1929, 60% of cars were bought on credit. Ford\u2019s $5-a-day wage doubled the average, turning factory workers into consumers. However, around 42% of Americans still lived below the poverty line. Farmers saw income collapse from $22 billion to $13 billion as overproduction drove prices down, and African Americans in the South remained trapped in sharecropping poverty under Jim Crow laws. The boom created a consumer revolution for some while deepening inequality for others.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Many Americans benefited because mass production made consumer goods affordable. Ford\u2019s Model T fell from $1,200 to $295, and hire purchase let families buy radios and fridges on monthly payments. However, not everyone gained \u2014 600,000 farmers lost their farms during the decade as crop prices fell.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: Americans could buy new goods like cars and radios because of mass production and hire purchase. By 1929, over 10 million radios were in American homes.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The boom meant people had more money to spend on things.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: New industries transformed the lives of some workers while leaving others worse off. Ford paid $5 a day \u2014 double the average wage \u2014 and introduced the five-day working week, giving factory workers in new industries unprecedented spending power. The car industry alone consumed 20% of America\u2019s steel, 80% of its rubber, and 75% of its plate glass, creating thousands of jobs in related trades like road-building and petrol stations. However, workers in old industries like coal and textiles suffered: coal demand fell as oil and electricity grew, and textile factories moved south for cheaper labour. Ford also refused to allow trade unions, the hours were long with few breaks, and he used intimidation against workers who complained. The boom created winners and losers even among the working class.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Workers in new industries like car manufacturing benefited from higher wages. Ford paid $5 a day and even paid Black workers the same as white workers. But workers in old industries like coal mining suffered as demand for coal fell and wages were cut.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: The car industry created lots of new jobs. By 1929, motor manufacturing was America\u2019s biggest industry, employing hundreds of thousands.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: New industries meant more jobs for workers.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        text: "Which of the following had more impact on the American economy in the 1920s:\n\n\u2022 mass production and new technology\n\u2022 Republican government policies?\n\nExplain your answer with reference to both bullet points.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both factors were crucial and reinforced each other. Mass production was arguably more directly important: Ford\u2019s assembly line cut the Model T build time from 12 hours to 93 minutes and the price from $1,200 to $295, creating a consumer revolution. The car industry consumed 20% of America\u2019s steel and 80% of its rubber, with knock-on effects across the economy. However, Republican policies created the conditions for this growth. Laissez-faire meant low taxes, leaving businesses with more capital to invest in new technology. The Fordney-McCumber Tariff of 1922 protected American manufacturers from foreign competition. Without these policies, mass production might not have been as profitable. Ultimately, mass production had the greater direct impact on everyday Americans\u2019 lives, but Republican policies provided the framework that allowed it to flourish.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Mass production transformed the economy. Ford\u2019s assembly line made goods affordable \u2014 the Model T fell to $295 by 1928. New consumer goods like radios and fridges were mass-produced, and by 1929 over 10 million radios were in American homes.\nExample (bullet 2): Republican policies also helped. Presidents Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover kept taxes low and the Fordney-McCumber Tariff protected American businesses from cheaper foreign imports.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Mass production made goods cheaper. Ford\u2019s cars became affordable for ordinary families.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: New technology helped the economy grow.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both had enormous impact and were closely linked. Hire purchase transformed spending habits: by 1929, 60% of cars and 80% of radios were bought on credit, allowing ordinary families to own goods they could never have afforded upfront. Advertising on radio, billboards, and in magazines created a culture of consumerism, making people feel they needed the latest products. Mail-order catalogues even brought goods to rural families far from shops. However, the motor car industry arguably had the greater structural impact. It consumed 20% of America\u2019s steel, 80% of its rubber, and 65% of its leather, creating a \u2018Cycle of Prosperity\u2019 that drove growth across the whole economy. Cars used seven billion gallons of petrol a year, making states like Texas wealthy. Roads, highways, motels, and suburbs all grew because of the car. Hire purchase and advertising accelerated demand, but it was the car industry that reshaped America\u2019s landscape, infrastructure, and employment patterns.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Hire purchase and advertising changed how Americans spent money. By 1929, 60% of cars were bought on credit. Radio advertising reached millions of homes, and by 1929 over 10 million radios were in use, all pushing consumers to buy more.\nExample (bullet 2): The motor car industry transformed the economy. By 1929 it was America\u2019s biggest industry, consuming vast amounts of steel, rubber, and glass, and creating jobs in road-building, petrol stations, and motels.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Hire purchase let people buy expensive goods like cars and radios by paying in monthly instalments instead of all at once.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Cars changed people\u2019s lives in the 1920s.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."
