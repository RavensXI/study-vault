        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Why Did Americans Fear Communism?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">After World War Two, the USA and the <strong>Soviet Union (USSR)</strong> became rival superpowers. The USA stood for <strong>capitalism</strong> and <strong>democracy</strong>. The USSR promoted <strong>communism</strong> &mdash; a system where the state controls the economy with no private property or free enterprise. This rivalry became the <strong>Cold War</strong>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">A string of events in the late 1940s sent American fears soaring:</p>

        <figure data-narration-id="n4" class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_cold_war_escalation.png" alt="Infographic showing the escalation of Cold War fears in America from 1945 to 1953 — from Soviet spy rings and the Iron Curtain through China turning communist and the Korean War">
        </figure>

        <div data-narration-id="n5" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Fear Factor</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n6">By 1950, Americans were genuinely terrified. Two wartime allies &mdash; China and the USSR &mdash; were now hostile nuclear powers. Fear of communist infiltration, atomic attack, and the <dfn class="term" data-def="The idea that if one country fell to communism, neighbouring countries would follow one by one, like a row of dominoes.">&lsquo;domino effect&rsquo;</dfn> created a climate of suspicion and paranoia. Schools ran <strong>&lsquo;duck and cover&rsquo; drills</strong>, teaching children to hide under their desks in case of nuclear attack &mdash; a vivid sign of how deep the fear ran.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n7">J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n8"><strong>J. Edgar Hoover</strong>, director of the <strong>FBI</strong>, was obsessed with rooting out communists. He had been tracking suspected radicals since the 1920s, and the Cold War gave him enormous power. Hoover built a vast surveillance network, tapping phones, opening mail, and compiling secret files on thousands of Americans. The FBI worked closely with HUAC, feeding it names of suspected communists. Hoover saw communist threats everywhere &mdash; in unions, universities, Hollywood, and even the civil rights movement.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n9">HUAC and the Hollywood Ten</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">The <strong>House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)</strong> investigated suspected communist activity in the United States. It had existed since 1938 but became far more active after the war.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n11">HUAC Targets Hollywood (1947)</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n12">In <strong>October 1947</strong>, HUAC turned on the <strong>film industry</strong>, believing communists were using movies to spread propaganda. The committee summoned dozens of writers, directors, and actors to testify.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">Most &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; witnesses cooperated, naming colleagues they suspected. However, <strong>ten writers and directors</strong> &mdash; the <strong>&lsquo;Hollywood Ten&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; refused to answer HUAC&rsquo;s questions, citing their <strong>First Amendment rights</strong>. They were found in <strong>contempt of Congress</strong>, sentenced to <strong>6&ndash;12 months</strong> in prison, and fined <strong>$1,000</strong> each.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n14" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Hollywood Blacklist</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n15">After the hearings, Hollywood studios created a <strong>blacklist</strong> &mdash; a secret list of people banned from working in the film industry because of suspected communist sympathies. Over <strong>300 actors, writers, directors, and producers</strong> were blacklisted. Many had their careers destroyed. Some worked under <strong>pseudonyms</strong> (false names). Others left the country entirely &mdash; the comedian <strong>Charlie Chaplin</strong> moved to Switzerland rather than face investigation. The blacklist lasted into the 1960s.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n16">The Red Scare in Popular Culture</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n17">Fear of communism seeped into everyday culture. The 1956 film <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> &mdash; about aliens secretly replacing ordinary people with emotionless copies &mdash; reflected widespread fears of communist infiltration. Playwright <strong>Arthur Miller</strong> wrote <em>The Crucible</em> (1953), a play about the Salem witch trials that was a direct <dfn class="term" data-def="A story in which characters and events represent a hidden or deeper meaning, often making a point about real-world issues.">allegory</dfn> for McCarthyism &mdash; innocent people destroyed by hysteria and false accusations.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n18">The Alger Hiss Case (1948&ndash;1950)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n19"><strong>Alger Hiss</strong> was a senior <strong>State Department official</strong> who had helped establish the <strong>United Nations</strong>. In 1948, former communist agent <strong>Whittaker Chambers</strong> accused Hiss of being a Soviet spy who had passed secret documents to the USSR in the 1930s.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">Hiss denied it. But <strong>Richard Nixon</strong> &mdash; then a young congressman on HUAC &mdash; pursued the case hard. Chambers produced microfilm of stolen documents hidden inside a pumpkin on his farm (the <strong>&lsquo;Pumpkin Papers&rsquo;</strong>). The statute of limitations meant Hiss could not be charged with espionage, but he was convicted of <strong>perjury</strong> (lying under oath) in <strong>January 1950</strong> and sentenced to <strong>5 years</strong> in prison.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">The Hiss case had a huge impact. If a senior government official could be a Soviet spy, communists might be anywhere. The case made Nixon&rsquo;s career and convinced many Americans that infiltration was a real threat.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n22">The Rosenbergs (1950&ndash;1953)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n23"><strong>Julius and Ethel Rosenberg</strong> were accused of passing <strong>atomic bomb secrets</strong> to the Soviet Union. Julius was an electrical engineer who had worked on military contracts. The FBI arrested the couple in <strong>1950</strong> and charged them with espionage.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n24" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Rosenberg Trial</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n25">The Rosenbergs were tried in <strong>March 1951</strong> and found guilty. They were sentenced to <strong>death</strong> &mdash; the first American civilians executed for espionage. Despite worldwide protests (<strong>Pope Pius XII</strong> and <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> both urged mercy), they were <strong>executed by electric chair</strong> on <strong>19 June 1953</strong>. Later evidence confirmed Julius was involved, but many historians believe Ethel&rsquo;s role was minimal and her execution unjust.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n26">Senator Joseph McCarthy</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n27"><strong>Joseph McCarthy</strong> was a Republican senator from Wisconsin who became the face of the anti-communist crusade. On <strong>9 February 1950</strong>, he gave a speech in <strong>Wheeling, West Virginia</strong>, claiming he had a list of <strong>205 communists</strong> in the <strong>State Department</strong>. The number changed in later speeches (sometimes 57, sometimes 81), and McCarthy never produced any evidence &mdash; but the accusation made headlines.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n28">McCarthy&rsquo;s Methods</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n29">McCarthy used fear, intimidation, and publicity:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n52">
          <li>He made <strong>wild accusations</strong> without evidence, branding people communists or communist sympathisers.</li>
          <li>As chairman of the <strong>Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations</strong>, he held public hearings where he <strong>bullied and humiliated</strong> witnesses.</li>
          <li>Anyone who challenged him risked being accused themselves. Few dared speak out.</li>
          <li>His targets ranged from government officials and army officers to professors, journalists, and fellow senators.</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n30">McCarthy&rsquo;s power fed on genuine fear. With the Korean War raging and the Soviets armed with nuclear weapons, his accusations struck a chord. At his peak, he had an <strong>approval rating of 50%</strong>.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n31">The Federal Loyalty Programme</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n32">Anti-communist hysteria went beyond McCarthy. In <strong>1947</strong>, President Truman introduced <strong>Executive Order 9835</strong> &mdash; the <strong>Federal Employee Loyalty Program</strong> &mdash; requiring all federal employees to be investigated for &lsquo;disloyalty.&rsquo; Between 1947 and 1953, around <strong>6.6 million</strong> government workers were investigated. Only about <strong>500</strong> were dismissed, but the programme spread suspicion and fear across the government.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n33">The Army-McCarthy Hearings (1954)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n34">McCarthy&rsquo;s downfall came when he overreached by accusing the <strong>US Army</strong> of harbouring communists. The <strong>Army-McCarthy hearings</strong> ran from <strong>April to June 1954</strong> and were <strong>televised nationally</strong>. For the first time, <strong>20 million Americans</strong> could watch McCarthy in action.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n35" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; &lsquo;Have You No Sense of Decency?&rsquo;</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n36">The key moment came on <strong>9 June 1954</strong>. The Army&rsquo;s lawyer, <strong>Joseph Welch</strong>, confronted McCarthy after he attacked a young lawyer in Welch&rsquo;s firm. Welch replied: <em>&lsquo;Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?&rsquo;</em> The gallery burst into applause. Millions watching on television saw McCarthy exposed as a bully.</p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n37">In <strong>December 1954</strong>, the Senate voted <strong>67 to 22</strong> to <strong>censure</strong> (formally condemn) McCarthy. His power was broken. He became isolated, turned to heavy drinking, and died on <strong>2 May 1957</strong>, aged just 48.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n38">Impact on Civil Liberties</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n39">The Red Scare and McCarthyism did lasting damage to American civil liberties:</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n47">When writing about McCarthyism, explain both <strong>why it happened</strong> (real fears driven by the Soviet bomb, communist China, Eastern Europe falling, and genuine spy cases) and <strong>why it was damaging</strong> (civil liberties crushed, careers ruined without evidence, climate of fear). Top answers explore the <strong>tension between national security and individual freedom</strong>. Use specific cases: the Hollywood Ten, Alger Hiss, the Rosenbergs, and the Army-McCarthy hearings.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n49">Conclusion</h2>
        <p data-narration-id="n50">The Red Scare was one of the darkest chapters for American civil liberties. Cold War fears were real, but the response went far beyond reasonable security. McCarthy exploited public fear for personal power, destroying careers with baseless accusations. HUAC, the blacklist, Hoover&rsquo;s FBI, and the loyalty programmes created a climate where free speech and free association were suspended. The Army-McCarthy hearings finally exposed McCarthy, but the damage was already done.</p>
        <h3 data-narration-id="n51">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n53">
          <li><strong>Context matters:</strong> The Red Scare grew from real fears &mdash; the Soviet bomb (1949), communist China (1949), the fall of Eastern Europe, the Korean War (1950&ndash;53), and spy cases like Hiss and the Rosenbergs.</li>
          <li><strong>HUAC and the blacklist:</strong> The Hollywood Ten were jailed. Over 300 entertainment figures were blacklisted. Careers were destroyed on suspicion alone.</li>
          <li><strong>McCarthy&rsquo;s rise and fall:</strong> He claimed communists had infiltrated government (1950) but never proved it. The Senate censured him in December 1954 after the Army-McCarthy hearings exposed his bullying.</li>
          <li><strong>Civil liberties damaged:</strong> Free speech, free association, and due process were all undermined. Thousands lost jobs. The fear silenced reformers and activists for years.</li>

Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which events were problematic.\nExample: One problem was the destruction of careers through the blacklist. After HUAC targeted Hollywood in 1947, studios created a secret blacklist banning over 300 actors, writers, directors, and producers from working. The Hollywood Ten were jailed for 6\u201312 months for refusing to answer HUAC\u2019s questions. Many others worked under false names or left the country entirely \u2014 Charlie Chaplin moved to Switzerland.\n\nAnother example: Another problem was the loss of freedom of speech. People feared expressing left-wing opinions because they could be accused of being communist sympathisers. Teachers, writers, and artists self-censored to avoid investigation.

Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which events were problematic.\nExample: One reason was the Soviet Union\u2019s growing power. In 1949, the USSR successfully tested its first atomic bomb, ending America\u2019s nuclear monopoly. Americans now faced the possibility of nuclear attack on their own soil. Schools ran \u2018duck and cover\u2019 drills teaching children to hide under desks, showing how deep the fear ran.\n\nAnother example: Another reason was the Alger Hiss case. Hiss was a senior State Department official who had helped establish the United Nations. In 1948, he was accused of being a Soviet spy. The \u2018Pumpkin Papers\u2019 \u2014 microfilm of stolen documents hidden in a pumpkin \u2014 seemed to prove the accusation. He was convicted of perjury in January 1950 and sentenced to 5 years. If a senior government official could be a spy, communists might be anywhere.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: McCarthyism affected different groups in different ways and created a climate of fear that went far beyond those directly targeted. In Hollywood, HUAC hearings led to the blacklisting of over 300 people and the jailing of the Hollywood Ten. Careers were destroyed on suspicion alone. Government workers faced Truman\u2019s Federal Employee Loyalty Program (1947), which investigated 6.6 million people and dismissed about 500. The McCarran Internal Security Act (1950) required communist organisations to register with the government and gave the President power to detain suspects. For ordinary Americans, the impact was a \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on free expression. People avoided unions, civil rights groups, and peace organisations for fear of being labelled communist. Teachers and writers self-censored. Civil rights activists were targeted \u2014 campaigners for racial equality were smeared as communists to discredit their work. Even after McCarthy\u2019s censure in December 1954, the damage lingered. The principle of \u2018innocent until proven guilty\u2019 had been reversed \u2014 people had to prove their innocence rather than the government proving guilt.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: McCarthyism destroyed careers. Over 300 entertainment figures were blacklisted, and the Hollywood Ten were jailed. Government workers were investigated under the Federal Loyalty Program \u2014 6.6 million checked, about 500 dismissed. Freedom of speech was damaged as people feared expressing left-wing views.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: Many people in Hollywood lost their jobs because of the blacklist. Over 300 people were banned from working in the film industry.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s).

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: The Hiss and Rosenberg cases had a massive psychological impact because they appeared to confirm that communist infiltration was real \u2014 not just McCarthy\u2019s fantasy. Alger Hiss was a senior State Department official who had helped establish the United Nations. When Whittaker Chambers accused him of being a Soviet spy in 1948, and the \u2018Pumpkin Papers\u2019 seemed to prove it, Americans were shocked. If someone at Hiss\u2019s level could be a spy, communists might be anywhere in government. His conviction for perjury (January 1950) made Richard Nixon\u2019s career and gave credibility to anti-communist investigations. The Rosenberg case was even more alarming. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were accused of passing atomic bomb secrets to the USSR. They were convicted in March 1951 and sentenced to death \u2014 the first American civilians executed for espionage (19 June 1953). Despite worldwide protests from Pope Pius XII and Albert Einstein, the executions went ahead. The case showed how seriously the government took the communist threat. Together, these cases created a climate where McCarthy\u2019s wild accusations seemed plausible, HUAC investigations seemed necessary, and ordinary Americans supported extreme measures like the McCarran Act and loyalty programmes.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Alger Hiss\u2019s conviction for perjury in January 1950 shocked Americans because he was a senior government official. The \u2018Pumpkin Papers\u2019 seemed to prove communist infiltration was real. The Rosenbergs\u2019 execution for espionage in 1953 showed how seriously the government treated the threat.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: Alger Hiss was a government official convicted of lying about being a Soviet spy. This made people think communists were inside the government.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s).

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both HUAC and McCarthy damaged civil liberties, but in different ways. HUAC had a longer-lasting institutional impact. It had existed since 1938 and became far more active after WWII. Its 1947 hearings targeting Hollywood led to the jailing of the Hollywood Ten (6\u201312 months each) and the creation of a blacklist banning over 300 people from the film industry. The blacklist lasted into the 1960s. HUAC hearings were not legal trials \u2014 the accused had to prove their innocence rather than the government proving guilt. People were named by \u2018friendly\u2019 witnesses and had their careers destroyed on suspicion alone. Charlie Chaplin left for Switzerland. Arthur Miller wrote The Crucible as an allegory for the witch-hunt atmosphere. McCarthy\u2019s investigations (1950\u20131954) had a more dramatic but shorter-lived impact. His wild accusations \u2014 claiming 205 communists in the State Department without evidence \u2014 created a climate of fear where anyone who challenged him risked accusation. At his peak he had 50% approval. His Senate Subcommittee bullied and humiliated witnesses. However, his overreach in attacking the US Army led to the televised Army-McCarthy hearings (1954), where Joseph Welch\u2019s \u2018Have you no sense of decency?\u2019 exposed him. The Senate censured him 67\u201322 in December 1954. HUAC had the greater lasting impact because it was institutional and systematic, while McCarthy\u2019s personal crusade collapsed when he was exposed. But together they created the climate of fear that silenced dissent.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): HUAC targeted Hollywood in 1947, jailing the Hollywood Ten and creating a blacklist of over 300 people. The blacklist lasted into the 1960s. HUAC reversed the principle of \u2018innocent until proven guilty.\u2019\nExample (bullet 2): McCarthy claimed communists had infiltrated government but never proved it. His Senate Subcommittee bullied witnesses. He was censured in December 1954 after the Army-McCarthy hearings exposed him.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: HUAC created the Hollywood blacklist, which banned over 300 people from working in film. The Hollywood Ten were jailed for refusing to answer questions.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Both HUAC and McCarthy accused people of being communists.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both international events and domestic spy cases fuelled anti-communist fears, and they reinforced each other. International events created the context of fear. The Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb in 1949, ending America\u2019s nuclear monopoly and raising the spectre of atomic war. Schools ran \u2018duck and cover\u2019 drills. China turned communist in 1949, meaning two huge powers were now hostile. The Korean War (1950\u201353) saw Americans fighting and dying against communist forces. Eastern Europe had fallen behind the \u2018Iron Curtain.\u2019 These events made the threat feel real and urgent. Domestic spy cases then brought the fear home. Alger Hiss \u2014 a senior State Department official who helped establish the UN \u2014 was convicted of perjury in January 1950 after the \u2018Pumpkin Papers\u2019 linked him to espionage. If someone at his level could be a spy, infiltration seemed plausible. The Rosenbergs were convicted of passing atomic bomb secrets to the USSR and executed in June 1953 \u2014 the first civilians executed for espionage. Both bullets are connected: international events created the climate of fear, and spy cases appeared to confirm that communist infiltration was happening inside America. Together they gave McCarthy and HUAC the ammunition to pursue their investigations. However, international events had the greater impact because without the Soviet bomb, communist China, and the Korean War, the spy cases alone would not have created such widespread hysteria.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): The Soviet bomb (1949) ended America\u2019s nuclear monopoly. China turned communist in 1949.
