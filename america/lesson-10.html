        <h2>The Sit-In Movement</h2>

        <p>On <strong>1 February 1960</strong>, four Black college students &mdash; Ezell Blair Jr., David Richmond, Franklin McCain, and Joseph McNeil &mdash; sat down at a whites-only lunch counter at <dfn class="term" data-def="A Woolworth's department store in Greensboro, North Carolina, where four Black college students staged a sit-in at the whites-only lunch counter on 1 February 1960, sparking a wave of similar protests across the South.">Woolworth&rsquo;s</dfn> in Greensboro, North Carolina, and politely asked to be served. When refused, they remained seated. This simple act of defiance sparked the <strong>sit-in movement</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Greensboro Sit-Ins</div>
          <p>Within two months, the sit-in movement had spread to <strong>54 cities</strong> across <strong>9 states</strong>. By the end of 1960, an estimated <strong>70,000 people</strong> had participated in sit-ins. The Woolworth&rsquo;s store in Greensboro desegregated its lunch counter on 25 July 1960. The movement inspired the creation of the <dfn class="term" data-def="The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, founded in April 1960 by young Black activists to coordinate student-led civil rights protests such as sit-ins and voter registration drives. SNCC played a key role in the Freedom Rides, Freedom Summer, and the March on Washington.">Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)</dfn> in April 1960.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Freedom Rides (1961)</h2>

        <p>In 1960, the Supreme Court had ruled in <em>Boynton v. Virginia</em> that segregation on interstate buses and in bus terminals was illegal. However, Southern states continued to ignore this ruling. To test and challenge this defiance, the <dfn class="term" data-def="The Congress of Racial Equality, a civil rights organisation founded in 1942 that organised the Freedom Rides in 1961. CORE pioneered non-violent direct action tactics in the civil rights movement.">Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)</dfn> organised the <strong>Freedom Rides</strong>.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p>On <strong>4 May 1961</strong>, 13 riders &mdash; both Black and white &mdash; set off from Washington, D.C., on two buses heading through the Deep South. They deliberately sat in integrated groups to challenge segregated seating and used whites-only facilities at bus stations.</p>
              <p>In <strong>Anniston, Alabama</strong>, one bus was <strong>firebombed</strong> by a white mob. In <strong>Birmingham, Alabama</strong>, riders were savagely beaten by Klansmen while local police stood by. Police Commissioner <strong>Bull Connor</strong> had allegedly given the mob 15 minutes to attack before officers intervened.</p>
              <p>Despite the violence, new volunteers &mdash; many from SNCC &mdash; replaced the original riders. In <strong>Montgomery</strong>, riders were again attacked, and Attorney General <strong>Robert Kennedy</strong> sent <strong>400 federal marshals</strong> to protect them.</p>
              <p>The crisis forced the federal government to act. In September 1961, the <strong>Interstate Commerce Commission</strong> issued strict new regulations banning segregation in interstate travel facilities, and this time enforcement followed.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Birmingham, Alabama (1963)</h2>

        <p>In spring 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC launched a major campaign in <strong>Birmingham, Alabama</strong> &mdash; widely considered the <strong>most segregated city in America</strong>. King deliberately chose Birmingham because he knew the city&rsquo;s notoriously racist police commissioner, <strong>Bull Connor</strong>, would respond with extreme violence, generating media coverage that would shock the nation.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Birmingham Campaign</div>
          <p>On <strong>2 May 1963</strong>, over <strong>1,000 Black schoolchildren</strong> marched through Birmingham in what became known as the <strong>Children&rsquo;s Crusade</strong>. Bull Connor ordered police to attack them with <strong>fire hoses</strong>, <strong>police dogs</strong>, and <strong>batons</strong>. Television cameras broadcast the shocking images across America and around the world. President <strong>John F. Kennedy</strong> said the images made him &ldquo;sick,&rdquo; and he began drafting civil rights legislation.</p>
        </div>

        <p>While imprisoned during the campaign, King wrote his famous <dfn class="term" data-def="An open letter written by Martin Luther King Jr. on 16 April 1963 while imprisoned in Birmingham, Alabama. Addressed to white clergymen who had called the protests 'unwise,' King defended non-violent direct action and argued that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.">&ldquo;Letter from Birmingham Jail,&rdquo;</dfn> defending non-violent direct action and arguing that <em>&ldquo;injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&rdquo;</em></p>

        <h2>The March on Washington (1963)</h2>

        <p>On <strong>28 August 1963</strong>, approximately <strong>250,000 people</strong> gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., for the <dfn class="term" data-def="A massive civil rights rally held in Washington, D.C. on 28 August 1963, where an estimated 250,000 people gathered to demand civil rights legislation. It was here that Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech.">March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</dfn>. It was one of the largest political rallies in American history, and the crowd was notably interracial &mdash; around <strong>60,000</strong> of the marchers were white.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; &ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo;</div>
          <p>The highlight of the march was Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s legendary <strong>&ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo;</strong> speech. Standing before the Lincoln Memorial, King declared: <em>&ldquo;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&rdquo;</em> The speech was broadcast live on television to millions and became one of the most famous speeches in history.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The March on Washington put enormous pressure on Congress to pass civil rights legislation. However, tragedy struck just weeks later when a bomb killed <strong>four young girls</strong> &mdash; Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, and Carol Denise McNair &mdash; at the <strong>16th Street Baptist Church</strong> in Birmingham on 15 September 1963, a brutal reminder that the struggle was far from over.</p>

        <h2>The Civil Rights Act (1964)</h2>

        <p>President Kennedy had introduced a civil rights bill in June 1963, but it was stalled in Congress. After Kennedy&rsquo;s <strong>assassination on 22 November 1963</strong>, his successor, President <strong>Lyndon B. Johnson</strong>, used his considerable political skill &mdash; and the nation&rsquo;s grief &mdash; to push the bill through.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Civil Rights Act 1964</div>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Banned discrimination</strong> based on race, colour, religion, sex, or national origin in employment and public places</li>

          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Selma and the Voting Rights Act (1965)</h2>

        <p>Despite the Civil Rights Act, Black voters in the South still faced massive obstacles. In <strong>Selma, Alabama</strong>, only <strong>2%</strong> of eligible Black citizens were registered to vote, due to intimidation, literacy tests, and deliberate bureaucratic obstruction.</p>

              <p>In early 1965, King and the SCLC launched a voter registration campaign in Selma. On <strong>7 March 1965</strong>, around 600 marchers set out to walk from Selma to Montgomery, the state capital. As they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were met by state troopers who attacked them with <strong>tear gas, clubs, and mounted horseback charges</strong>.</p>

          <p>The impact was dramatic: within a year, <strong>250,000</strong> new Black voters were registered. In Mississippi, Black voter registration rose from <strong>6.7%</strong> to <strong>59.8%</strong> by 1968.</p>

        <h2>Malcolm X and Black Power</h2>

        <p>Not all African Americans supported King&rsquo;s philosophy of non-violence and integration. <dfn class="term" data-def="Born Malcolm Little in 1925, Malcolm X was a minister of the Nation of Islam who advocated Black nationalism, self-defence, and racial pride.

He described King&rsquo;s March on Washington as the &ldquo;Farce on Washington&rdquo; and criticised non-violent protesters for allowing themselves to be beaten.</p>
              <p>Malcolm X appealed particularly to <strong>young Black Americans in Northern cities</strong>, where legal segregation did not exist but poverty, unemployment, and police brutality created deep frustration. He argued that Black people should build their own businesses, schools, and communities rather than seeking acceptance from white America.</p>
              <p>In 1964, Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam and made a pilgrimage to Mecca, which led him to adopt a more inclusive worldview. He was <strong>assassinated on 21 February 1965</strong> while speaking in New York. His autobiography, published after his death, became hugely influential.</p>

        <h3>The Rise of Black Power</h3>

        <p>By the mid-1960s, many younger activists were frustrated with the slow pace of change and the continued violence against Black communities. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A political movement that emerged in the mid-1960s, emphasising racial pride, Black self-determination, and the creation of Black political and cultural institutions.

        <p>On <strong>4 April 1968</strong>, Martin Luther King Jr. was <strong>assassinated</strong> by James Earl Ray in Memphis, Tennessee, where he had gone to support striking sanitation workers. King was just <strong>39 years old</strong>.</p>

        <p>His death triggered <strong>riots in over 100 American cities</strong>, with the worst violence in Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Baltimore. The tragedy underscored the anger and frustration felt by Black Americans and accelerated the passage of the <strong>Civil Rights Act of 1968</strong> (the Fair Housing Act), which banned discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing.</p>

        <p>A common exam question asks you to evaluate the <strong>significance of different events or individuals</strong> in the civil rights movement. To achieve top marks, you should compare <strong>multiple factors</strong> &mdash; for example, was the March on Washington more important than Selma? Were legal changes (Civil Rights Act) or direct action (sit-ins, marches) more significant? Always support your argument with <strong>specific evidence</strong> and reach a <strong>balanced judgement</strong>.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1960s were the most dramatic and consequential decade of the civil rights movement. Through extraordinary courage and sacrifice, the movement achieved landmark legislation &mdash; the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 &mdash; that dismantled the legal framework of segregation and secured voting rights for millions. However, the decade also revealed deep divisions within the movement itself, as Black Power challenged King&rsquo;s philosophy of non-violence and integration. The assassinations of JFK, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr., and the riots that followed, showed that while the legal battle had been largely won, the deeper struggle for genuine equality was far from over.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Non-violent direct action</strong> &mdash; sit-ins, Freedom Rides, and marches &mdash; was devastatingly effective at exposing the brutality of segregation and generating public support through media coverage.</li>
          <li><strong>The Civil Rights Act (1964)</strong> banned racial discrimination in public places and employment, ending legal segregation.</li>
          <li><strong>The Voting Rights Act (1965)</strong> removed the barriers that had prevented Black Americans from voting, transforming Southern politics.</li>
          <li><strong>Malcolm X and Black Power</strong> offered an alternative vision emphasising racial pride and self-determination, reflecting the frustrations of Black Americans in Northern cities.</li>
          <li><strong>King&rsquo;s assassination (1968)</strong> was a devastating blow that triggered nationwide riots and symbolised the violence that had always underpinned American racism.</li>
        </ul>
