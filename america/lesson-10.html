        <h2>Why Did Americans Fear Communism?</h2>

        <p>After World War Two, the USA and the <strong>Soviet Union (USSR)</strong> became rival superpowers. The USA stood for <strong>capitalism</strong> and <strong>democracy</strong>. The USSR promoted <strong>communism</strong> &mdash; a system where the state controls the economy with no private property or free enterprise. This rivalry became the <strong>Cold War</strong>.</p>

        <p>A string of events in the late 1940s sent American fears soaring:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>1945:</strong> A Soviet spy ring was uncovered in Canada, raising fears of communist espionage in North America.</li>
          <li><strong>1945&ndash;48:</strong> The Soviet Union took control of <strong>Eastern Europe</strong>. Country after country &mdash; Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria &mdash; became communist states under Soviet influence. Americans watched an &lsquo;Iron Curtain&rsquo; fall across the continent.</li>
          <li><strong>1947:</strong> President Truman announced the <strong>Truman Doctrine</strong>, pledging to contain communism worldwide.</li>
          <li><strong>1948&ndash;49:</strong> The <strong>Berlin Blockade</strong> heightened Cold War tensions in Europe.</li>
          <li><strong>1949:</strong> <strong>China became communist</strong> under Mao Zedong &mdash; the world&rsquo;s most populous nation had &lsquo;fallen&rsquo; to communism.</li>
          <li><strong>1949:</strong> The Soviet Union tested its <strong>first atomic bomb</strong>, ending America&rsquo;s nuclear monopoly. Many believed the Soviets had stolen the technology through spies.</li>
          <li><strong>1950&ndash;53:</strong> The <strong>Korean War</strong> saw American soldiers fighting communist forces, making the threat feel immediate.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Fear Factor</div>
          <p>By 1950, Americans were genuinely terrified. Two wartime allies &mdash; China and the USSR &mdash; were now hostile nuclear powers. Fear of communist infiltration, atomic attack, and the <dfn class="term" data-def="The idea that if one country fell to communism, neighbouring countries would follow one by one, like a row of dominoes.">&lsquo;domino effect&rsquo;</dfn> created a climate of suspicion and paranoia. Schools ran <strong>&lsquo;duck and cover&rsquo; drills</strong>, teaching children to hide under their desks in case of nuclear attack &mdash; a vivid sign of how deep the fear ran.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI</h2>

        <p><strong>J. Edgar Hoover</strong>, director of the <strong>FBI</strong>, was obsessed with rooting out communists. He had been tracking suspected radicals since the 1920s, and the Cold War gave him enormous power. Hoover built a vast surveillance network, tapping phones, opening mail, and compiling secret files on thousands of Americans. The FBI worked closely with HUAC, feeding it names of suspected communists. Hoover saw communist threats everywhere &mdash; in unions, universities, Hollywood, and even the civil rights movement.</p>

        <h2>HUAC and the Hollywood Ten</h2>

        <p>The <strong>House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)</strong> investigated suspected communist activity in the United States. It had existed since 1938 but became far more active after the war.</p>

        <h3>HUAC Targets Hollywood (1947)</h3>
        <p>In <strong>October 1947</strong>, HUAC turned on the <strong>film industry</strong>, believing communists were using movies to spread propaganda. The committee summoned dozens of writers, directors, and actors to testify.</p>

        <p>Most &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; witnesses cooperated, naming colleagues they suspected. However, <strong>ten writers and directors</strong> &mdash; the <strong>&lsquo;Hollywood Ten&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; refused to answer HUAC&rsquo;s questions, citing their <strong>First Amendment rights</strong>. They were found in <strong>contempt of Congress</strong>, sentenced to <strong>6&ndash;12 months</strong> in prison, and fined <strong>$1,000</strong> each.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Hollywood Blacklist</div>
          <p>After the hearings, Hollywood studios created a <strong>blacklist</strong> &mdash; a secret list of people banned from working in the film industry because of suspected communist sympathies. Over <strong>300 actors, writers, directors, and producers</strong> were blacklisted. Many had their careers destroyed. Some worked under <strong>pseudonyms</strong> (false names). Others left the country entirely &mdash; the comedian <strong>Charlie Chaplin</strong> moved to Switzerland rather than face investigation. The blacklist lasted into the 1960s.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Red Scare in Popular Culture</h3>
        <p>Fear of communism seeped into everyday culture. The 1956 film <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> &mdash; about aliens secretly replacing ordinary people with emotionless copies &mdash; reflected widespread fears of communist infiltration. Playwright <strong>Arthur Miller</strong> wrote <em>The Crucible</em> (1953), a play about the Salem witch trials that was a direct <dfn class="term" data-def="A story in which characters and events represent a hidden or deeper meaning, often making a point about real-world issues.">allegory</dfn> for McCarthyism &mdash; innocent people destroyed by hysteria and false accusations.</p>

        <h2>The Alger Hiss Case (1948&ndash;1950)</h2>

        <p><strong>Alger Hiss</strong> was a senior <strong>State Department official</strong> who had helped establish the <strong>United Nations</strong>. In 1948, former communist agent <strong>Whittaker Chambers</strong> accused Hiss of being a Soviet spy who had passed secret documents to the USSR in the 1930s.</p>

        <p>Hiss denied it. But <strong>Richard Nixon</strong> &mdash; then a young congressman on HUAC &mdash; pursued the case hard. Chambers produced microfilm of stolen documents hidden inside a pumpkin on his farm (the <strong>&lsquo;Pumpkin Papers&rsquo;</strong>). The statute of limitations meant Hiss could not be charged with espionage, but he was convicted of <strong>perjury</strong> (lying under oath) in <strong>January 1950</strong> and sentenced to <strong>5 years</strong> in prison.</p>

        <p>The Hiss case had a huge impact. If a senior government official could be a Soviet spy, communists might be anywhere. The case made Nixon&rsquo;s career and convinced many Americans that infiltration was a real threat.</p>

        <h2>The Rosenbergs (1950&ndash;1953)</h2>

        <p><strong>Julius and Ethel Rosenberg</strong> were accused of passing <strong>atomic bomb secrets</strong> to the Soviet Union. Julius was an electrical engineer who had worked on military contracts. The FBI arrested the couple in <strong>1950</strong> and charged them with espionage.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Rosenberg Trial</div>
          <p>The Rosenbergs were tried in <strong>March 1951</strong> and found guilty. They were sentenced to <strong>death</strong> &mdash; the first American civilians executed for espionage. Despite worldwide protests (<strong>Pope Pius XII</strong> and <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> both urged mercy), they were <strong>executed by electric chair</strong> on <strong>19 June 1953</strong>. Later evidence confirmed Julius was involved, but many historians believe Ethel&rsquo;s role was minimal and her execution unjust.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Senator Joseph McCarthy</h2>

        <p><strong>Joseph McCarthy</strong> was a Republican senator from Wisconsin who became the face of the anti-communist crusade. On <strong>9 February 1950</strong>, he gave a speech in <strong>Wheeling, West Virginia</strong>, claiming he had a list of <strong>205 communists</strong> in the <strong>State Department</strong>. The number changed in later speeches (sometimes 57, sometimes 81), and McCarthy never produced any evidence &mdash; but the accusation made headlines.</p>

        <h3>McCarthy&rsquo;s Methods</h3>
        <p>McCarthy used fear, intimidation, and publicity:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>He made <strong>wild accusations</strong> without evidence, branding people communists or communist sympathisers.</li>
          <li>As chairman of the <strong>Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations</strong>, he held public hearings where he <strong>bullied and humiliated</strong> witnesses.</li>
          <li>Anyone who challenged him risked being accused themselves. Few dared speak out.</li>
          <li>His targets ranged from government officials and army officers to professors, journalists, and fellow senators.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>McCarthy&rsquo;s power fed on genuine fear. With the Korean War raging and the Soviets armed with nuclear weapons, his accusations struck a chord. At his peak, he had an <strong>approval rating of 50%</strong>.</p>

        <h3>The Federal Loyalty Programme</h3>
        <p>Anti-communist hysteria went beyond McCarthy. In <strong>1947</strong>, President Truman introduced <strong>Executive Order 9835</strong> &mdash; the <strong>Federal Employee Loyalty Program</strong> &mdash; requiring all federal employees to be investigated for &lsquo;disloyalty.&rsquo; Between 1947 and 1953, around <strong>6.6 million</strong> government workers were investigated. Only about <strong>500</strong> were dismissed, but the programme spread suspicion and fear across the government.</p>

        <h2>The Army-McCarthy Hearings (1954)</h2>

        <p>McCarthy&rsquo;s downfall came when he overreached by accusing the <strong>US Army</strong> of harbouring communists. The <strong>Army-McCarthy hearings</strong> ran from <strong>April to June 1954</strong> and were <strong>televised nationally</strong>. For the first time, <strong>20 million Americans</strong> could watch McCarthy in action.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; &lsquo;Have You No Sense of Decency?&rsquo;</div>
          <p>The key moment came on <strong>9 June 1954</strong>. The Army&rsquo;s lawyer, <strong>Joseph Welch</strong>, confronted McCarthy after he attacked a young lawyer in Welch&rsquo;s firm. Welch replied: <em>&lsquo;Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?&rsquo;</em> The gallery burst into applause. Millions watching on television saw McCarthy exposed as a bully.</p>
        </div>

        <p>In <strong>December 1954</strong>, the Senate voted <strong>67 to 22</strong> to <strong>censure</strong> (formally condemn) McCarthy. His power was broken. He became isolated, turned to heavy drinking, and died on <strong>2 May 1957</strong>, aged just 48.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Civil Liberties</h2>

        <p>The Red Scare and McCarthyism did lasting damage to American civil liberties:</p>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Freedom of speech:</strong> People feared expressing &lsquo;left-wing&rsquo; opinions. Teachers, writers, and artists self-censored to avoid investigation or blacklisting.</p>
              <p><strong>Freedom of association:</strong> Belonging to any group linked to the political left &mdash; even decades earlier &mdash; could lead to investigation or dismissal. People avoided unions, civil rights groups, and peace organisations.</p>
              <p><strong>Due process:</strong> Many were accused without evidence and denied a proper defence. HUAC hearings were not legal trials. The principle of &lsquo;innocent until proven guilty&rsquo; was reversed &mdash; the accused had to <strong>prove their innocence</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>Careers destroyed:</strong> Thousands lost their jobs based on accusations, not evidence. Teachers, government workers, entertainers, and journalists were fired or blacklisted.</p>
              <p><strong>The McCarran Internal Security Act (1950):</strong> Required communist organisations to register with the government and gave the President power to detain suspected subversives in an emergency. Truman vetoed it, calling it &lsquo;the greatest danger to freedom of speech, press, and assembly since the Alien and Sedition Laws of 1798,&rsquo; but Congress overrode his veto.</p>
              <p><strong>Chilling effect on reform:</strong> The Red Scare made social campaigning dangerous. Civil rights activists were labelled communists to discredit their work. Trade unionists and peace campaigners were targeted and silenced.</p>

      <div class="exam-tip">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When writing about McCarthyism, explain both <strong>why it happened</strong> (real fears driven by the Soviet bomb, communist China, Eastern Europe falling, and genuine spy cases) and <strong>why it was damaging</strong> (civil liberties crushed, careers ruined without evidence, climate of fear). Top answers explore the <strong>tension between national security and individual freedom</strong>. Use specific cases: the Hollywood Ten, Alger Hiss, the Rosenbergs, and the Army-McCarthy hearings.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Red Scare was one of the darkest chapters for American civil liberties. Cold War fears were real, but the response went far beyond reasonable security. McCarthy exploited public fear for personal power, destroying careers with baseless accusations. HUAC, the blacklist, Hoover&rsquo;s FBI, and the loyalty programmes created a climate where free speech and free association were suspended. The Army-McCarthy hearings finally exposed McCarthy, but the damage was already done.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Context matters:</strong> The Red Scare grew from real fears &mdash; the Soviet bomb (1949), communist China (1949), the fall of Eastern Europe, the Korean War (1950&ndash;53), and spy cases like Hiss and the Rosenbergs.</li>
          <li><strong>HUAC and the blacklist:</strong> The Hollywood Ten were jailed. Over 300 entertainment figures were blacklisted. Careers were destroyed on suspicion alone.</li>
          <li><strong>McCarthy&rsquo;s rise and fall:</strong> He claimed communists had infiltrated government (1950) but never proved it. The Senate censured him in December 1954 after the Army-McCarthy hearings exposed his bullying.</li>
          <li><strong>Civil liberties damaged:</strong> Free speech, free association, and due process were all undermined. Thousands lost jobs. The fear silenced reformers and activists for years.</li>
        </ul>
