        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">What Was Prohibition?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2"><strong>Prohibition</strong> was the ban on making, selling, and transporting alcoholic drinks in the United States. The <strong>18th Amendment</strong> to the Constitution was passed in January 1919 and took effect on <strong>17 January 1920</strong>. The <strong>Volstead Act</strong> (October 1919) set out the rules, making it illegal to produce, sell, or move any drink with more than <strong>0.5% alcohol</strong>.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n3" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Legal Framework</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n4">The <strong>18th Amendment</strong> (1919) made Prohibition part of the Constitution. The <strong>Volstead Act</strong> (1919) set the enforcement rules. Together, they banned the manufacture, sale, and transport of &lsquo;intoxicating liquors&rsquo; &mdash; but it was <strong>never illegal to drink alcohol</strong>. People could consume it; they just could not legally get it.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n5">Why Was Prohibition Introduced?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">The campaign for Prohibition had been growing for decades:</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">The Temperance Movement</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n8">Groups like the <strong>Anti-Saloon League</strong> (founded 1893) and the <strong>Women&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union</strong> (WCTU) had campaigned against alcohol for years. They argued it destroyed families, caused domestic violence, and led to poverty. These groups were well-funded and politically powerful.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">Religious and Moral Arguments</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n10">Many Protestant Christians, especially in rural areas and the South, saw alcohol as sinful. They called saloons &lsquo;dens of vice&rsquo; and believed a ban would create a more moral, God-fearing society.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n11">Industrial Efficiency</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n12">Industrialists like <strong>Henry Ford</strong> and <strong>John D. Rockefeller</strong> backed Prohibition. They believed sober workers would be more productive. Fewer accidents and less absenteeism meant higher profits.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n13">Anti-German Sentiment</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n14">During World War One, many of America&rsquo;s biggest breweries were owned by German-Americans (such as <strong>Anheuser-Busch</strong> and <strong>Pabst</strong>). Anti-German feeling during the war made it easier to target the brewing industry. Grain used for brewing could go to the war effort instead.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n15">How Was Prohibition Enforced?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n16"><strong>Prohibition agents</strong> were responsible for enforcement, but the task was almost impossible from the start:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n48">
          <li>Only about <strong>1,500 agents</strong> policed the entire country &mdash; a vast territory with <strong>18,700 miles</strong> of coastline and borders.</li>
          <li>Agents were poorly paid (about <strong>$2,500 a year</strong>), making many easy to bribe.</li>
          <li>In the first four years, <strong>1 in 12 agents</strong> were sacked for corruption.</li>
          <li>Many state and local police forces were unwilling or unable to enforce the law, especially in big cities.</li>
        </ul>

        <div data-narration-id="n17" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Eliot Ness</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n18"><strong>Eliot Ness</strong> was a young Prohibition agent in Chicago. He led a team called &lsquo;The Untouchables&rsquo; because they refused bribes. They raided Capone&rsquo;s breweries, but Ness&rsquo;s team was the exception &mdash; widespread corruption undermined enforcement everywhere.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n19">Breaking the Law: Bootlegging and Speakeasies</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">Instead of stopping drinking, Prohibition drove the alcohol trade underground and created a huge illegal industry:</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n21">Bootlegging</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n22"><strong>Bootleggers</strong> illegally made, moved, or sold alcohol. It was smuggled from <strong>Canada</strong> and <strong>Mexico</strong>, or shipped in from the Caribbean (&lsquo;<strong>rum running</strong>&rsquo;). Famous rum runners like <strong>William McCoy</strong> made fortunes &mdash; he smuggled an estimated <strong>$70 million</strong> worth of whiskey in just four years. Even <strong>Joseph Kennedy</strong> (father of the future President) reportedly made money from bootlegging. Others brewed &lsquo;<dfn class="term" data-def="Illegally home-made alcohol, often produced in hidden stills.">moonshine</dfn>&rsquo; in bathtubs or hidden stills. There were never enough agents to close down all the stills. This home-made alcohol was often deadly &mdash; <strong>98 people</strong> died from poisonous moonshine in 1920, rising to <strong>760 deaths</strong> in 1926 as illegal production spread. In total, an estimated <strong>10,000 people</strong> died from poisonous bootleg liquor during Prohibition.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n23">Speakeasies</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n24"><strong>Speakeasies</strong> were illegal bars that sprang up across America. By 1925, there were an estimated <strong>15,000</strong> in Detroit alone. By 1929, New York had around <strong>32,000</strong> &mdash; more than double the number of legal bars before Prohibition. Nationwide, there were roughly <strong>200,000 speakeasies</strong> by 1930. The name came from speaking quietly (&lsquo;easy&rsquo;) about their location. Many hid behind secret doors, in basements, or disguised as shops. Some had concealed entrances and required a <strong>secret password</strong> to get in. The famous <strong>21 Club</strong> in New York was a speakeasy for the rich and famous. Others simply had supplies of illegal alcohol delivered to their homes.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n25">The Rise of Organised Crime</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n26">Prohibition created a huge opportunity for <strong>organised crime</strong>. Criminal gangs took control of the illegal alcohol trade, making vast fortunes and wielding huge power.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n27">Al Capone</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n28"><strong>Alphonse &lsquo;Al&rsquo; Capone</strong> was the most notorious gangster of the Prohibition era. From a <strong>poor immigrant background</strong>, Capone rose to control most of Chicago&rsquo;s criminal underworld. His gang earned an estimated <strong>$100 million a year</strong> in total ($1.3 billion in today&rsquo;s money) from bootlegging, gambling dens, brothels, and protection rackets. He had around <strong>600 gangsters</strong> under his command, as well as lawyers and accountants to manage his empire.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n29" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Al Capone&rsquo;s Power</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n30">Capone controlled much of Chicago through <strong>bribery and violence</strong>. He had judges, police, and politicians on his payroll &mdash; including the <strong>Chief of Police</strong> and the <strong>Mayor of Chicago</strong> &mdash; bribing officials with an estimated <strong>$75 million</strong> over his career. Capone appeared on the <strong>front cover of <em>Time</em> magazine</strong> in March 1930, opened nightclubs, and was cheered at horse races. Many poor Americans admired him as a <strong>&lsquo;Robin Hood&rsquo;</strong> figure &mdash; he even opened <strong>soup kitchens</strong> to feed the homeless when the Depression began. Capone himself said: <strong>&ldquo;I make my money by supplying a popular demand. If I break the law, my customers are as guilty as I am&hellip; I call myself a businessman.&rdquo;</strong> Despite ordering many murders, Capone was finally convicted in <strong>1931</strong> &mdash; not for murder or bootlegging, but for <strong>tax evasion</strong>. He was sentenced to <strong>11 years</strong> in prison.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n31">The St Valentine&rsquo;s Day Massacre</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n32">The most infamous act of gang violence was the <strong>St Valentine&rsquo;s Day Massacre</strong> on <strong>14 February 1929</strong>. Gunmen working for Capone dressed as police officers and entered a garage on Chicago&rsquo;s North Clark Street. They told <strong>seven members</strong> of the rival <strong>Bugs Moran</strong> gang to line up against the wall, then shot them all in the back. Moran himself arrived late and missed the attack. When asked who was behind it, Moran said: <strong>&ldquo;Only Capone kills like that!&rdquo;</strong> One victim survived long enough to be questioned, but kept to the gangster code of silence &mdash; his only statement was <strong>&ldquo;No-one.&rdquo;</strong> The massacre shocked the nation. Capone was in Florida at the time and was never charged.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n33">Gang Wars and Violence</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n34">Chicago was not the only city hit. The fight for control of bootlegging &mdash; known as the <strong>&lsquo;Beer Wars&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; caused <strong>hundreds of murders</strong> across American cities. In Chicago alone, there were over <strong>500 gang-related murders</strong> between 1927 and 1930. Corruption was rampant &mdash; in many cities, police and politicians were on the gangsters&rsquo; payroll.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n35">Why Did Prohibition Fail?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n36">By the late 1920s, it was clear Prohibition was not working:</p>

        <figure data-narration-id="n37" class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_prohibition_failure.jpg" alt="Infographic showing six interconnected reasons why Prohibition failed: impossible enforcement, mass law-breaking, corruption, organised crime, lost tax revenue, and the Great Depression">
        </figure>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n38">The End of Prohibition</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n39">In the <strong>1932 election</strong>, <strong>Franklin D. Roosevelt</strong> promised to end Prohibition. After his landslide win, the <strong>21st Amendment</strong> was ratified on <strong>5 December 1933</strong>, repealing the 18th Amendment and ending Prohibition after nearly 14 years. It remains the only time a Constitutional Amendment has been repealed.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n40" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The 21st Amendment</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n41">The <strong>21st Amendment</strong> (1933) repealed Prohibition. Roosevelt reportedly said: &lsquo;I think this would be a good time for a beer.&rsquo; Ending Prohibition created jobs, brought in tax revenue, and cut off a major income source for organised crime &mdash; though gangs simply moved into other rackets like drugs and gambling.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n45">Conclusion</h2>
        <p data-narration-id="n46">Prohibition was widely regarded as a failure. Introduced with genuine moral aims, it proved impossible to enforce, fuelled the rise of organised crime, corrupted law enforcement, and was ignored by millions. Rather than creating a sober society, it showed the limits of using the law to change deep-rooted social behaviour.</p>
        <h3 data-narration-id="n47">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n49">
          <li><strong>Good intentions, disastrous results:</strong> Moral, religious, and economic arguments backed Prohibition &mdash; but its consequences (organised crime, corruption, mass law-breaking) were far worse than the problems it aimed to fix.</li>
          <li><strong>Al Capone and organised crime:</strong> The illegal alcohol trade made gangsters like Capone hugely wealthy, with empires that corrupted police, judges, and politicians.</li>
          <li><strong>The 21st Amendment:</strong> Prohibition was repealed in 1933 &mdash; the only time a Constitutional Amendment has been undone. Its failure showed laws only work when the public supports them.</li>

Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which pressure groups and moral arguments led to the ban on alcohol.\nExample: The temperance movement was a major reason. Powerful groups like the Anti-Saloon League (founded 1893) and the Women\u2019s Christian Temperance Union campaigned for years, arguing that alcohol destroyed families, caused domestic violence, and led to poverty. They were well-funded and politically influential, putting huge pressure on Congress.\n\nAnother example: Anti-German sentiment during World War One helped push Prohibition through. Many of America\u2019s biggest breweries were owned by German-Americans, such as Anheuser-Busch and Pabst. Anti-German feeling during the war made it easier to target the brewing industry, and grain used for brewing could instead support the war effort.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge. Students demonstrate relevant knowledge about the issue(s) identified.\nExample: Religious groups thought alcohol was sinful and wanted it banned.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which enforcement was undermined.\nExample: There were far too few agents to enforce the law. Only about 1,500 Prohibition agents policed the entire country, which had 18,700 miles of coastline and borders to patrol. This made it physically impossible to stop the vast amount of alcohol being smuggled in from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean.\n\nAnother example: Widespread corruption among enforcement officers undermined Prohibition. Agents were poorly paid at about $2,500 a year, making many easy to bribe. In the first four years, 1 in 12 agents were sacked for corruption. Al Capone spent an estimated $75 million bribing officials including the Chief of Police and the Mayor of Chicago.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: Prohibition affected Americans in contradictory ways. Rather than creating a sober society, it drove alcohol underground and made law-breaking routine. By 1929, New York had around 32,000 speakeasies \u2014 more than double the number of legal bars before Prohibition. Bootlegging became a huge industry: rum runner William McCoy smuggled an estimated $70 million of whiskey in four years. For ordinary Americans, illegal drinking became normal, and respect for the law was undermined. Prohibition also had deadly consequences \u2014 an estimated 10,000 people died from poisonous moonshine. Most dramatically, it fuelled the rise of organised crime: Al Capone\u2019s gang earned $100 million a year controlling Chicago\u2019s illegal alcohol trade. The St Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre (1929) shocked the nation. However, some groups \u2014 rural, religious Americans \u2014 initially supported the ban as a moral victory, even as it failed in practice.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Prohibition led to a huge increase in organised crime. Al Capone\u2019s gang earned $100 million a year from bootlegging and other rackets. He bribed police, judges, and politicians. It also created speakeasies \u2014 by 1929, New York had about 32,000 illegal bars where Americans drank despite the law.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: Prohibition led to the growth of speakeasies. These were illegal bars where people could buy alcohol secretly. There were about 200,000 across America by 1930.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: People still drank alcohol even though it was banned.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: Prohibition created an enormous illegal market that organised crime moved to control. Al Capone built a criminal empire in Chicago that earned an estimated $100 million a year from bootlegging, gambling, brothels, and protection rackets. He had around 600 gangsters under his command plus lawyers and accountants. His power came from both violence and bribery \u2014 he had judges, police, and the Mayor of Chicago on his payroll, spending an estimated $75 million on bribes over his career. Gang violence reached its peak with the St Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre on 14 February 1929, when Capone\u2019s men murdered seven members of the rival Bugs Moran gang. Chicago alone saw over 500 gang-related murders between 1927 and 1930. Capone was so famous he appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1930 and opened soup kitchens during the Depression. Despite ordering many murders, he was only convicted of tax evasion in 1931, showing how deeply corruption had penetrated the justice system.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Al Capone controlled most of Chicago\u2019s criminal underworld, earning $100 million a year. He bribed police and politicians, including the Mayor. Gang violence also grew \u2014 the St Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre in 1929 saw seven men shot dead in a single attack.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: Al Capone became very powerful because of Prohibition. His gang made huge amounts of money from selling illegal alcohol.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s).

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both factors were closely linked and together made Prohibition unworkable. Enforcement was impossible from the start: only 1,500 agents policed a country with 18,700 miles of coastline, and agents earned just $2,500 a year, making bribery easy \u2014 1 in 12 were sacked for corruption. Millions of Americans ignored the law: by 1929, New York had 32,000 speakeasies. This mass law-breaking created the opportunity for organised crime. Capone\u2019s gang earned $100 million a year controlling Chicago\u2019s bootlegging trade, and he spent an estimated $75 million bribing officials, including the Chief of Police and the Mayor. The St Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre (1929) showed the extreme violence organised crime brought. Organised crime then made enforcement even harder by corrupting the very officials meant to uphold the law. However, the impossibility of enforcement was arguably the more fundamental problem \u2014 without it, organised crime would not have had the opportunity to grow. The root cause was that too many Americans wanted to drink, and no number of agents could stop them.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Enforcement was nearly impossible. Only 1,500 agents tried to police the whole country, and many were corrupt \u2014 1 in 12 were sacked. There were 32,000 speakeasies in New York alone by 1929.\nExample (bullet 2): Organised crime grew enormously. Al Capone earned $100 million a year and bribed police, judges, and politicians. Gang violence killed hundreds \u2014 over 500 gang murders in Chicago between 1927 and 1930.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Enforcement was very difficult because there were only 1,500 agents for the whole country and many were corrupt.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Prohibition failed because it was too hard to enforce and criminals took over.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Prohibition and Capone\u2019s activities were directly connected \u2014 without Prohibition, Capone\u2019s empire would not have existed. Prohibition (18th Amendment, 1920) affected the entire nation. It banned the manufacture, sale, and transport of alcohol, creating a culture of mass law-breaking. By 1930, about 200,000 speakeasies operated across America. An estimated 10,000 people died from poisonous moonshine. The ban showed the tension between moral reformers and ordinary Americans who saw drinking as their right. Capone\u2019s activities demonstrated the worst consequences of Prohibition. His empire earned $100 million a year, he had 600 gangsters under his command, and he corrupted police, judges, and politicians across Chicago. The St Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre (1929) shocked the nation. Yet Capone was also admired \u2014 he appeared on the cover of Time magazine and opened soup kitchens. His conviction for tax evasion in 1931 showed the justice system could not touch him for his real crimes. Prohibition had the wider impact because it changed the behaviour of millions, but Capone became the symbol of everything that went wrong with it.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Prohibition changed American society by banning alcohol nationwide. This led to mass law-breaking \u2014 by 1929 there were 32,000 speakeasies in New York alone \u2014 and an estimated 10,000 deaths from poisonous moonshine.\nExample (bullet 2): Al Capone built a criminal empire earning $100 million a year. He bribed the Mayor and Chief of Police of Chicago. The St Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre in 1929 showed the violence organised crime brought.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Prohibition was supposed to stop people drinking but instead it created speakeasies and bootlegging.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Prohibition and Al Capone were both important in the 1920s.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."
