        <h2>What Was Prohibition?</h2>

        <p><strong>Prohibition</strong> was the ban on making, selling, and transporting alcoholic drinks in the United States. The <strong>18th Amendment</strong> to the Constitution was passed in January 1919 and took effect on <strong>17 January 1920</strong>. The <strong>Volstead Act</strong> (October 1919) set out the rules, making it illegal to produce, sell, or move any drink with more than <strong>0.5% alcohol</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Legal Framework</div>
          <p>The <strong>18th Amendment</strong> (1919) made Prohibition part of the Constitution. The <strong>Volstead Act</strong> (1919) set the enforcement rules. Together, they banned the manufacture, sale, and transport of &lsquo;intoxicating liquors&rsquo; &mdash; but it was <strong>never illegal to drink alcohol</strong>. People could consume it; they just could not legally get it.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Was Prohibition Introduced?</h2>

        <p>The campaign for Prohibition had been growing for decades:</p>

        <h3>The Temperance Movement</h3>
        <p>Groups like the <strong>Anti-Saloon League</strong> (founded 1893) and the <strong>Women&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union</strong> (WCTU) had campaigned against alcohol for years. They argued it destroyed families, caused domestic violence, and led to poverty. These groups were well-funded and politically powerful.</p>

        <h3>Religious and Moral Arguments</h3>
        <p>Many Protestant Christians, especially in rural areas and the South, saw alcohol as sinful. They called saloons &lsquo;dens of vice&rsquo; and believed a ban would create a more moral, God-fearing society.</p>

        <h3>Industrial Efficiency</h3>
        <p>Industrialists like <strong>Henry Ford</strong> and <strong>John D. Rockefeller</strong> backed Prohibition. They believed sober workers would be more productive. Fewer accidents and less absenteeism meant higher profits.</p>

        <h3>Anti-German Sentiment</h3>
        <p>During World War One, many of America&rsquo;s biggest breweries were owned by German-Americans (such as <strong>Anheuser-Busch</strong> and <strong>Pabst</strong>). Anti-German feeling during the war made it easier to target the brewing industry. Grain used for brewing could go to the war effort instead.</p>

        <h2>How Was Prohibition Enforced?</h2>

        <p><strong>Prohibition agents</strong> were responsible for enforcement, but the task was almost impossible from the start:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Only about <strong>1,500 agents</strong> policed the entire country &mdash; a vast territory with <strong>18,700 miles</strong> of coastline and borders.</li>
          <li>Agents were poorly paid (about <strong>$2,500 a year</strong>), making many easy to bribe.</li>
          <li>In the first four years, <strong>1 in 12 agents</strong> were sacked for corruption.</li>
          <li>Many state and local police forces were unwilling or unable to enforce the law, especially in big cities.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Eliot Ness</div>
          <p><strong>Eliot Ness</strong> was a young Prohibition agent in Chicago. He led a team called &lsquo;The Untouchables&rsquo; because they refused bribes. They raided Capone&rsquo;s breweries, but Ness&rsquo;s team was the exception &mdash; widespread corruption undermined enforcement everywhere.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Breaking the Law: Bootlegging and Speakeasies</h2>

        <p>Instead of stopping drinking, Prohibition drove the alcohol trade underground and created a huge illegal industry:</p>

        <h3>Bootlegging</h3>
        <p><strong>Bootleggers</strong> illegally made, moved, or sold alcohol. It was smuggled from <strong>Canada</strong> and <strong>Mexico</strong>, or shipped in from the Caribbean (&lsquo;<strong>rum running</strong>&rsquo;). Famous rum runners like <strong>William McCoy</strong> made fortunes &mdash; he smuggled an estimated <strong>$70 million</strong> worth of whiskey in just four years. Even <strong>Joseph Kennedy</strong> (father of the future President) reportedly made money from bootlegging. Others brewed &lsquo;<dfn class="term" data-def="Illegally home-made alcohol, often produced in hidden stills. It could be dangerously toxic.">moonshine</dfn>&rsquo; in bathtubs or hidden stills. There were never enough agents to close down all the stills. This home-made alcohol was often deadly &mdash; <strong>98 people</strong> died from poisonous moonshine in 1920, rising to <strong>760 deaths</strong> in 1926 as illegal production spread. In total, an estimated <strong>10,000 people</strong> died from poisonous bootleg liquor during Prohibition.</p>

        <h3>Speakeasies</h3>
        <p><strong>Speakeasies</strong> were illegal bars that sprang up across America. By 1925, there were an estimated <strong>15,000</strong> in Detroit alone. By 1929, New York had around <strong>32,000</strong> &mdash; more than double the number of legal bars before Prohibition. Nationwide, there were roughly <strong>200,000 speakeasies</strong> by 1930. The name came from speaking quietly (&lsquo;easy&rsquo;) about their location. Many hid behind secret doors, in basements, or disguised as shops. Some had concealed entrances and required a <strong>secret password</strong> to get in. The famous <strong>21 Club</strong> in New York was a speakeasy for the rich and famous. Others simply had supplies of illegal alcohol delivered to their homes.</p>

        <h2>The Rise of Organised Crime</h2>

        <p>Prohibition created a huge opportunity for <strong>organised crime</strong>. Criminal gangs took control of the illegal alcohol trade, making vast fortunes and wielding huge power.</p>

        <h3>Al Capone</h3>
        <p><strong>Alphonse &lsquo;Al&rsquo; Capone</strong> was the most notorious gangster of the Prohibition era. From a <strong>poor immigrant background</strong>, Capone rose to control most of Chicago&rsquo;s criminal underworld. His gang earned an estimated <strong>$100 million a year</strong> in total ($1.3 billion in today&rsquo;s money) from bootlegging, gambling dens, brothels, and protection rackets. He had around <strong>600 gangsters</strong> under his command, as well as lawyers and accountants to manage his empire.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Al Capone&rsquo;s Power</div>
          <p>Capone controlled much of Chicago through <strong>bribery and violence</strong>. He had judges, police, and politicians on his payroll &mdash; including the <strong>Chief of Police</strong> and the <strong>Mayor of Chicago</strong> &mdash; bribing officials with an estimated <strong>$75 million</strong> over his career. Capone appeared on the <strong>front cover of <em>Time</em> magazine</strong> in March 1930, opened nightclubs, and was cheered at horse races. Many poor Americans admired him as a <strong>&lsquo;Robin Hood&rsquo;</strong> figure &mdash; he even opened <strong>soup kitchens</strong> to feed the homeless when the Depression began. Capone himself said: <strong>&ldquo;I make my money by supplying a popular demand. If I break the law, my customers are as guilty as I am&hellip; I call myself a businessman.&rdquo;</strong> Despite ordering many murders, Capone was finally convicted in <strong>1931</strong> &mdash; not for murder or bootlegging, but for <strong>tax evasion</strong>. He was sentenced to <strong>11 years</strong> in prison.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The St Valentine&rsquo;s Day Massacre</h3>
        <p>The most infamous act of gang violence was the <strong>St Valentine&rsquo;s Day Massacre</strong> on <strong>14 February 1929</strong>. Gunmen working for Capone dressed as police officers and entered a garage on Chicago&rsquo;s North Clark Street. They told <strong>seven members</strong> of the rival <strong>Bugs Moran</strong> gang to line up against the wall, then shot them all in the back. Moran himself arrived late and missed the attack. When asked who was behind it, Moran said: <strong>&ldquo;Only Capone kills like that!&rdquo;</strong> One victim survived long enough to be questioned, but kept to the gangster code of silence &mdash; his only statement was <strong>&ldquo;No-one.&rdquo;</strong> The massacre shocked the nation. Capone was in Florida at the time and was never charged.</p>

        <h3>Gang Wars and Violence</h3>
        <p>Chicago was not the only city hit. The fight for control of bootlegging &mdash; known as the <strong>&lsquo;Beer Wars&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; caused <strong>hundreds of murders</strong> across American cities. In Chicago alone, there were over <strong>500 gang-related murders</strong> between 1927 and 1930. Corruption was rampant &mdash; in many cities, police and politicians were on the gangsters&rsquo; payroll.</p>

        <h2>Why Did Prohibition Fail?</h2>

        <p>By the late 1920s, it was clear Prohibition was not working:</p>

          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Reasons for Prohibition&rsquo;s failure</span>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Impossible to enforce:</strong> The USA was too large. With thousands of miles of borders and only 1,500 agents, there was no way to stop illegal alcohol.</p>
              <p><strong>Widespread law-breaking:</strong> Millions of Americans kept drinking. Many saw Prohibition as an unfair limit on personal freedom. Even some politicians and judges drank illegally.</p>
              <p><strong>Corruption:</strong> Poorly paid agents, police, judges, and politicians were easily bribed. In some cities, the criminal underworld and the authorities were almost the same thing.</p>
              <p><strong>Organised crime:</strong> Prohibition handed the drinks trade to violent criminals who made huge profits. The gangs grew more powerful and more dangerous.</p>
              <p><strong>Lost tax revenue:</strong> The government lost the tax it used to collect from legal alcohol, while enforcement costs drained public funds.</p>
              <p><strong>The Great Depression:</strong> After the 1929 Crash, ending Prohibition became an economic argument too &mdash; legal alcohol would create jobs and generate tax revenue the government badly needed.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The End of Prohibition</h2>

        <p>In the <strong>1932 election</strong>, <strong>Franklin D. Roosevelt</strong> promised to end Prohibition. After his landslide win, the <strong>21st Amendment</strong> was ratified on <strong>5 December 1933</strong>, repealing the 18th Amendment and ending Prohibition after nearly 14 years. It remains the only time a Constitutional Amendment has been repealed.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The 21st Amendment</div>
          <p>The <strong>21st Amendment</strong> (1933) repealed Prohibition. Roosevelt reportedly said: &lsquo;I think this would be a good time for a beer.&rsquo; Ending Prohibition created jobs, brought in tax revenue, and cut off a major income source for organised crime &mdash; though gangs simply moved into other rackets like drugs and gambling.</p>

        <p>Questions often ask <strong>why Prohibition was introduced</strong> or <strong>why it failed</strong>. Give multiple reasons with specific evidence. For top marks, show how the reasons <strong>link</strong> &mdash; impossible enforcement led to mass law-breaking, which created the chance for organised crime, which corrupted the very officials meant to enforce the law.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Prohibition was widely regarded as a failure. Introduced with genuine moral aims, it proved impossible to enforce, fuelled the rise of organised crime, corrupted law enforcement, and was ignored by millions. Rather than creating a sober society, it showed the limits of using the law to change deep-rooted social behaviour.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Good intentions, disastrous results:</strong> Moral, religious, and economic arguments backed Prohibition &mdash; but its consequences (organised crime, corruption, mass law-breaking) were far worse than the problems it aimed to fix.</li>
          <li><strong>Al Capone and organised crime:</strong> The illegal alcohol trade made gangsters like Capone hugely wealthy, with empires that corrupted police, judges, and politicians.</li>
          <li><strong>The 21st Amendment:</strong> Prohibition was repealed in 1933 &mdash; the only time a Constitutional Amendment has been undone. Its failure showed laws only work when the public supports them.</li>
        </ul>
