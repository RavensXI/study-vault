        <h2>Women Before the 1920s</h2>

        <p>Before World War One, the role of most American women was firmly centred on the home. Respectable middle-class women were expected to be wives and mothers, to dress modestly, and to avoid public life. Women could not vote in federal elections, had limited access to higher education, and very few worked outside the home in professional roles. Society expected women to be quiet, obedient, and devoted to their families.</p>

        <h3>The Impact of World War One</h3>
        <p>The war changed things dramatically. With millions of men away fighting, women stepped into jobs previously reserved for men &mdash; working in factories, offices, and on farms. By 1918, around <strong>1 million women</strong> had entered the workforce in roles they had never held before. This experience gave many women a new sense of independence and confidence, and it became much harder to argue that women were incapable of working or participating in public life.</p>

        <h2>The 19th Amendment: Women&rsquo;s Suffrage</h2>

        <p>The <strong>19th Amendment</strong> to the US Constitution was ratified on <strong>18 August 1920</strong>, granting women the right to vote in all elections. This was the culmination of decades of campaigning by the <strong>suffrage movement</strong>, led by activists such as <strong>Susan B. Anthony</strong>, <strong>Elizabeth Cady Stanton</strong>, and <strong>Alice Paul</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The 19th Amendment</div>
          <p>The 19th Amendment stated: &lsquo;The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.&rsquo; However, in practice, many African American women (and men) in the South were still prevented from voting through poll taxes, literacy tests, and intimidation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Flappers</h2>

        <p>The most visible symbol of changing women&rsquo;s roles in the 1920s was the <strong>flapper</strong>. Flappers were young, fashionable women &mdash; mainly from middle-class, white, urban backgrounds &mdash; who deliberately challenged traditional expectations about how women should look and behave.</p>

        <h3>How Did Flappers Challenge Convention?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fashion:</strong> Flappers wore short skirts (knee-length, which was scandalous at the time), bobbed their hair, and used make-up &mdash; lipstick, rouge, and eye-liner &mdash; in public. They rejected the modest, restrictive clothing of previous generations.</li>
          <li><strong>Behaviour:</strong> They smoked cigarettes in public, drank alcohol (often at speakeasies), danced to jazz music, and drove cars. They went out without chaperones and socialised freely with men.</li>
          <li><strong>Attitudes:</strong> Flappers represented a new attitude of independence and freedom. They rejected the idea that a woman&rsquo;s only role was to be a wife and mother, and they embraced fun, leisure, and personal choice.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Jazz and the Flappers</div>
          <p>The 1920s are often called the <strong>&lsquo;Jazz Age&rsquo;</strong>. Jazz music, with its energetic rhythms, became the soundtrack of the flapper lifestyle. Dances like the <strong>Charleston</strong> and the <strong>Black Bottom</strong> were seen as wild and shocking by older generations. Flappers flocked to dance halls and jazz clubs, making the music central to the decade&rsquo;s youth culture.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Wider Changes for Women</h2>

        <p>The changes in women&rsquo;s lives went beyond the flapper image:</p>

        <h3>Employment</h3>
        <p>The number of women in employment increased by <strong>25%</strong> during the 1920s, reaching around <strong>10.6 million</strong> by 1929. New industries and the growth of office work created opportunities for women as secretaries, typists, telephone operators, and shop assistants. However, women were still paid significantly less than men for the same work, and most professional careers (law, medicine, senior management) remained largely closed to them.</p>

        <h3>New Technology in the Home</h3>
        <p>Labour-saving devices such as <strong>vacuum cleaners, washing machines, and refrigerators</strong> reduced the time women spent on housework. This freed up time for leisure activities, education, or paid employment. However, these devices were expensive and only available to wealthier families.</p>

        <h3>Birth Control</h3>
        <p><strong>Margaret Sanger</strong> was a key campaigner for women&rsquo;s access to birth control in the 1920s. She opened the first <strong>birth control clinic</strong> in 1916 and founded the <strong>American Birth Control League</strong> in 1921. Access to contraception gave some women greater control over family size, though the topic remained controversial and many states restricted access.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>The number of women attending college increased significantly. By 1928, there were <strong>10 times</strong> as many female college students as there had been in 1900. Education opened up new career opportunities and gave women greater economic independence.</p>

        <h2>Limits of Change</h2>

        <p>It is important not to overstate the changes. The flapper lifestyle was experienced by only a <strong>small minority</strong> of women, and many aspects of women&rsquo;s lives remained unchanged:</p>

            <span>Limitations on women&rsquo;s progress</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Rural vs Urban:</strong> The flapper phenomenon was largely an urban, middle-class trend. In <strong>rural areas</strong> and small towns, traditional values dominated. Women were still expected to be homemakers, and the flapper lifestyle was seen as immoral and shocking. Only about <strong>1 in 4 women</strong> worked outside the home.</p>
              <p><strong>Race:</strong> African American, Hispanic, and immigrant women saw far fewer benefits. They were mostly confined to low-paid domestic service or agricultural work. <strong>African American women</strong> in the South faced the double burden of racial segregation and gender inequality, with little access to the freedoms enjoyed by white flappers.</p>
              <p><strong>Class:</strong> The flapper lifestyle required money. Working-class women, who made up the majority, could not afford fashionable clothes, trips to dance halls, or new consumer goods. Many worked long hours in factories or as domestic servants for low pay.</p>
              <p><strong>Political impact:</strong> Despite gaining the vote in 1920, women did not immediately use it to bring about major political change. Women did not vote as a unified bloc, and very few women were elected to political office during the 1920s. The political establishment remained overwhelmingly male.</p>
              <p><strong>Backlash:</strong> Many Americans &mdash; particularly in rural, religious communities &mdash; actively opposed the changes. Anti-flapper sentiment was strong, with religious leaders and traditionalists condemning the new behaviour as sinful and immoral. Some states even tried to pass laws restricting women&rsquo;s hemline lengths.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; A Divided Picture</div>
          <p>The experience of women in the 1920s was deeply divided along lines of <strong>geography, race, and class</strong>. While a young, white, middle-class woman in New York or Chicago might have experienced real freedom and excitement, a Black sharecropper&rsquo;s wife in Mississippi or an immigrant factory worker in a northern city would have seen little change in her daily life.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>A common exam question is: <strong>&lsquo;How far did the lives of women change in the 1920s?&rsquo;</strong> To score highly, you must discuss both the changes (flappers, the vote, new employment) <strong>and</strong> the limitations (rural vs urban, race, class). The strongest answers will argue that change was <strong>real but limited</strong> to a minority of women, and will use specific examples to support both sides of the argument.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1920s saw significant changes in the lives of some American women. The 19th Amendment gave women the vote, the flapper movement challenged traditional expectations about appearance and behaviour, and more women entered the workforce and higher education. However, these changes were experienced mainly by young, white, middle-class, urban women. For the majority &mdash; including rural women, African Americans, and working-class women &mdash; life remained largely unchanged. The 1920s planted seeds of change, but full equality was still decades away.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The 19th Amendment (1920)</strong> was a landmark achievement, but its practical impact was limited, especially for African American women in the South.</li>
          <li><strong>Flappers</strong> were a visible symbol of change, but they represented a small, privileged minority &mdash; not the experience of most American women.</li>
          <li><strong>The limits of change</strong> were defined by geography (urban vs rural), race (white vs minority), and class (middle-class vs working-class). Examiners want you to show awareness of these divisions.</li>
