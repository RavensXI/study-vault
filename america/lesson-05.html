        <h2>What Was the Wall Street Crash?</h2>

        <p>The <strong>Wall Street Crash</strong> of October 1929 was the sudden collapse of share prices on the <strong>New York Stock Exchange</strong>. In days, billions of dollars were wiped out, ruining millions of investors and triggering the worst economic depression in modern history.</p>

        <p>The mood before the Crash was one of total confidence. During the <strong>1928 presidential campaign</strong>, Republican candidate <strong>Herbert Hoover</strong> promised Americans <strong>&ldquo;a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage.&rdquo;</strong> This summed up the overconfidence of the era &mdash; the belief that prosperity would last forever.</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_wall_street_crash.png" alt="Infographic showing the scale of the 1929 Wall Street Crash — share values fell from $87 billion to $30 billion, with $14 billion lost in one week during Black Thursday and Black Tuesday">
        </figure>

        <h2>Long-Term Causes of the Crash</h2>

        <p>The Crash did not happen overnight. Serious weaknesses had been building throughout the 1920s:</p>

        <h3>Speculation</h3>
        <p>Millions of ordinary Americans bought shares hoping to make quick profits. By 1929, about <strong>1.5 million Americans</strong> owned shares. Many were not experienced investors &mdash; just ordinary people caught up in the excitement.</p>

        <p>Many bought shares <strong>&lsquo;on the margin&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; borrowing money from banks and paying only <strong>10%</strong> upfront. This worked while prices rose. If prices fell, investors would owe far more than their shares were worth.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Buying on the Margin</div>
          <p>By 1929, <strong>$8.5 billion</strong> had been loaned for share purchases &mdash; more than the entire amount of money in circulation in the USA. The stock market was a giant bubble, inflated by borrowed money and blind optimism.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Hire Purchase and Easy Credit</h3>
        <p>The boom was fuelled by <dfn class="term" data-def="A system where buyers pay for goods in regular instalments while using them, only owning the item outright once all payments are made.">hire purchase</dfn> (buying on credit). Millions of Americans bought cars, fridges, and radios on monthly instalments. This made people feel wealthy, but they were actually piling up debt. When the Crash came, many still owed money on goods they could no longer afford.</p>

        <h3>Overproduction</h3>
        <p>Factories produced far more goods than people could buy. Mass production churned out goods at record rates, but <strong>wages had not risen fast enough</strong> for most workers to keep up. By the late 1920s, warehouses were filling with unsold cars, fridges, radios, and clothing. Businesses cut production and laid off workers, reducing spending power even further.</p>

        <h3>Unequal Distribution of Wealth</h3>
        <p>1920s prosperity was shared very unevenly. The richest <strong>5%</strong> of Americans received about <strong>33%</strong> of all national income. Around <strong>60%</strong> of families earned less than <strong>$2,000 per year</strong> &mdash; the minimum for a decent life. Too many people were too poor to buy consumer goods, so overproduction was inevitable.</p>

        <h3>Republican Laissez-Faire and Weak Banks</h3>
        <p>The <dfn class="term" data-def="A policy of minimal government interference in the economy, leaving businesses and markets to operate freely.">Republican laissez-faire</dfn> approach meant the government deliberately chose <strong>not to regulate banks</strong>. There were thousands of small, independent banks, many making risky loans to speculators and farmers. Banks even gambled with their customers&rsquo; deposits on the stock market. There was no federal deposit insurance, so if a bank failed, savers lost everything. The banking system was a house of cards.</p>

        <h3>Agricultural Problems</h3>
        <p>Farmers had struggled throughout the 1920s. Overproduction drove down crop prices, and many were deep in debt. When farmers could not repay loans, rural banks began to fail. This weakness spread to the wider economy.</p>

        <h3>International Trade Problems</h3>
        <p>American tariffs (like the <strong>Fordney-McCumber Tariff</strong> of 1922) made foreign goods expensive, but other countries hit back with tariffs on American exports. This shrank overseas markets for American goods. European economies were also weak, further reducing demand.</p>

        <h2>The Events of October 1929</h2>

        <p>Confidence began to waver in September 1929 as experienced investors sold shares, sensing prices had risen too high. The situation collapsed rapidly:</p>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>&lsquo;Black Thursday&rsquo; (24 Oct):</strong> Panic selling began. Nearly <strong>13 million shares</strong> were traded in one day. Leading bankers pooled money to buy shares and briefly steadied prices, but confidence was shattered.</p>
              <p><strong>&lsquo;Black Monday&rsquo; (28 Oct):</strong> Selling resumed harder. The bankers&rsquo; rescue failed. The market lost <strong>13%</strong> in a single day.</p>
              <p><strong>&lsquo;Black Tuesday&rsquo; (29 Oct):</strong> The worst day. Over <strong>16 million shares</strong> were dumped in panic. Prices collapsed. Margin investors were ruined &mdash; they owed more than their shares were now worth.</p>
              <p><strong>The weeks after:</strong> Prices kept falling. By mid-November the market had lost about <strong>$30 billion</strong>. There was no recovery &mdash; prices fell until 1932.</p>

        <h2>Immediate Consequences</h2>

        <p>The crash had devastating effects:</p>

        <h3>Investors Ruined</h3>
        <p>Millions who had invested their savings lost everything. Margin buyers were left with huge debts. Some wealthy investors were reduced to poverty overnight.</p>

        <h3>Banks Collapsed</h3>
        <p>Banks had lent huge sums to investors who could now not repay. By 1929&ndash;1932, over <strong>5,000 banks</strong> collapsed. Ordinary savers lost everything because there was no government insurance. Panic spread as people rushed to withdraw cash from surviving banks, causing even more to fail.</p>

        <h3>Businesses Failed</h3>
        <p>With banks collapsing and credit drying up, businesses could not get loans. Consumer spending plummeted. Factories cut production, shops closed, companies went bankrupt. By 1933, industrial production had fallen nearly <strong>50%</strong> from its 1929 level.</p>

        <h3>Unemployment Soared</h3>
        <p>Unemployment rose from about <strong>1.5 million</strong> in 1929 to over <strong>13 million</strong> by 1933 &mdash; roughly <strong>25%</strong> of the workforce. With no welfare system, unemployed workers and their families faced destitution.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; A Vicious Cycle</div>
          <p>The crash created a <strong>downward spiral</strong>: share prices fell &rarr; investors lost money &rarr; banks failed &rarr; people lost savings &rarr; businesses closed &rarr; workers lost jobs &rarr; spending fell &rarr; more businesses closed. This vicious cycle plunged America into the <strong>Great Depression</strong>.</p>

        <p>Distinguish between <strong>long-term causes</strong> (speculation, overproduction, unequal wealth, hire purchase debt, laissez-faire banking) and <strong>short-term triggers</strong> (October 1929 panic selling). The best answers show how long-term weaknesses made the crash inevitable. Link causes together &mdash; overproduction led to falling profits, which made share prices drop, which triggered panic selling.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Wall Street Crash was not just a stock market event. Years of speculation, overproduction, hire purchase debt, unequal wealth, and an unregulated banking system had built an economy on borrowed money and false confidence. Republican laissez-faire meant nobody stepped in to control the risks. When panic hit in October 1929, the whole structure collapsed, dragging millions into poverty and launching the Great Depression.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Long-term causes mattered most:</strong> Speculation, overproduction, unequal wealth, hire purchase debt, and unregulated banks all made the crash inevitable.</li>
          <li><strong>Black Tuesday (29 Oct 1929):</strong> Over 16 million shares were sold in panic. Share values fell from $87 billion to $30 billion in weeks.</li>
          <li><strong>Devastating consequences:</strong> Over 5,000 banks failed, unemployment hit 25%, and the crash triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li>
        </ul>
