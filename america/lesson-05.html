        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">What Was the Wall Street Crash?</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The <strong>Wall Street Crash</strong> of October 1929 was the sudden collapse of share prices on the <strong>New York Stock Exchange</strong>. In days, billions of dollars were wiped out, ruining millions of investors and triggering the worst economic depression in modern history.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">The mood before the Crash was one of total confidence. During the <strong>1928 presidential campaign</strong>, Republican candidate <strong>Herbert Hoover</strong> promised Americans <strong>&ldquo;a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage.&rdquo;</strong> This summed up the overconfidence of the era &mdash; the belief that prosperity would last forever.</p>

        <figure data-narration-id="n4" class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_wall_street_crash.jpg" alt="Infographic showing the scale of the 1929 Wall Street Crash — share values fell from $87 billion to $30 billion, with $14 billion lost in one week during Black Thursday and Black Tuesday">
        </figure>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n5">Long-Term Causes of the Crash</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">The Crash did not happen overnight. Serious weaknesses had been building throughout the 1920s:</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">Speculation</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n8">Millions of ordinary Americans bought shares hoping to make quick profits. By 1929, about <strong>1.5 million Americans</strong> owned shares. Many were not experienced investors &mdash; just ordinary people caught up in the excitement.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">Many bought shares <strong>&lsquo;on the margin&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; borrowing money from banks and paying only <strong>10%</strong> upfront. This worked while prices rose. If prices fell, investors would owe far more than their shares were worth.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n10" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Buying on the Margin</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n11">By 1929, <strong>$8.5 billion</strong> had been loaned for share purchases &mdash; more than the entire amount of money in circulation in the USA. The stock market was a giant bubble, inflated by borrowed money and blind optimism.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n12">Hire Purchase and Easy Credit</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n13">The boom was fuelled by <dfn class="term" data-def="A system where buyers pay for goods in regular instalments while using them, only owning the item outright once all payments are made.">hire purchase</dfn> (buying on credit). Millions of Americans bought cars, fridges, and radios on monthly instalments. This made people feel wealthy, but they were actually piling up debt. When the Crash came, many still owed money on goods they could no longer afford.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n14">Overproduction</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n15">Factories produced far more goods than people could buy. Mass production churned out goods at record rates, but <strong>wages had not risen fast enough</strong> for most workers to keep up. By the late 1920s, warehouses were filling with unsold cars, fridges, radios, and clothing. Businesses cut production and laid off workers, reducing spending power even further.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n16">Unequal Distribution of Wealth</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n17">1920s prosperity was shared very unevenly. The richest <strong>5%</strong> of Americans received about <strong>33%</strong> of all national income. Around <strong>60%</strong> of families earned less than <strong>$2,000 per year</strong> &mdash; the minimum for a decent life. Too many people were too poor to buy consumer goods, so overproduction was inevitable.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n18">Republican Laissez-Faire and Weak Banks</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n19">The <dfn class="term" data-def="A policy of minimal government interference in the economy, leaving businesses and markets to operate freely.">Republican laissez-faire</dfn> approach meant the government deliberately chose <strong>not to regulate banks</strong>. There were thousands of small, independent banks, many making risky loans to speculators and farmers. Banks even gambled with their customers&rsquo; deposits on the stock market. There was no federal deposit insurance, so if a bank failed, savers lost everything. The banking system was a house of cards.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n20">Agricultural Problems</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n21">Farmers had struggled throughout the 1920s. Overproduction drove down crop prices, and many were deep in debt. When farmers could not repay loans, rural banks began to fail. This weakness spread to the wider economy.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n22">International Trade Problems</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n23">American tariffs (like the <strong>Fordney-McCumber Tariff</strong> of 1922) made foreign goods expensive, but other countries hit back with tariffs on American exports. This shrank overseas markets for American goods. European economies were also weak, further reducing demand.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n24">The Events of October 1929</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n25">Confidence began to waver in September 1929 as experienced investors sold shares, sensing prices had risen too high. The situation collapsed rapidly:</p>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n26"><strong>&lsquo;Black Thursday&rsquo; (24 Oct):</strong> Panic selling began. Nearly <strong>13 million shares</strong> were traded in one day. Leading bankers pooled money to buy shares and briefly steadied prices, but confidence was shattered.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n27"><strong>&lsquo;Black Monday&rsquo; (28 Oct):</strong> Selling resumed harder. The bankers&rsquo; rescue failed. The market lost <strong>13%</strong> in a single day.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n28"><strong>&lsquo;Black Tuesday&rsquo; (29 Oct):</strong> The worst day. Over <strong>16 million shares</strong> were dumped in panic. Prices collapsed. Margin investors were ruined &mdash; they owed more than their shares were now worth.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n29"><strong>The weeks after:</strong> Prices kept falling. By mid-November the market had lost about <strong>$30 billion</strong>. There was no recovery &mdash; prices fell until 1932.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n30">Immediate Consequences</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n31">The crash had devastating effects:</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n32">Investors Ruined</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n33">Millions who had invested their savings lost everything. Margin buyers were left with huge debts. Some wealthy investors were reduced to poverty overnight.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n34">Banks Collapsed</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n35">Banks had lent huge sums to investors who could now not repay. By 1929&ndash;1932, over <strong>5,000 banks</strong> collapsed. Ordinary savers lost everything because there was no government insurance. Panic spread as people rushed to withdraw cash from surviving banks, causing even more to fail.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n36">Businesses Failed</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n37">With banks collapsing and credit drying up, businesses could not get loans. Consumer spending plummeted. Factories cut production, shops closed, companies went bankrupt. By 1933, industrial production had fallen nearly <strong>50%</strong> from its 1929 level.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n38">Unemployment Soared</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n39">Unemployment rose from about <strong>1.5 million</strong> in 1929 to over <strong>13 million</strong> by 1933 &mdash; roughly <strong>25%</strong> of the workforce. With no welfare system, unemployed workers and their families faced destitution.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n40" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; A Vicious Cycle</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n41">The crash created a <strong>downward spiral</strong>: share prices fell &rarr; investors lost money &rarr; banks failed &rarr; people lost savings &rarr; businesses closed &rarr; workers lost jobs &rarr; spending fell &rarr; more businesses closed. This vicious cycle plunged America into the <strong>Great Depression</strong>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n43">Distinguish between <strong>long-term causes</strong> (speculation, overproduction, unequal wealth, hire purchase debt, laissez-faire banking) and <strong>short-term triggers</strong> (October 1929 panic selling). The best answers show how long-term weaknesses made the crash inevitable. Link causes together &mdash; overproduction led to falling profits, which made share prices drop, which triggered panic selling.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div data-narration-id="n44" class="conclusion">
        <h2 data-narration-id="n45">Conclusion</h2>
        <p data-narration-id="n46">The Wall Street Crash was not just a stock market event. Years of speculation, overproduction, hire purchase debt, unequal wealth, and an unregulated banking system had built an economy on borrowed money and false confidence. Republican laissez-faire meant nobody stepped in to control the risks. When panic hit in October 1929, the whole structure collapsed, dragging millions into poverty and launching the Great Depression.</p>
        <h3 data-narration-id="n47">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n48">
          <li><strong>Long-term causes mattered most:</strong> Speculation, overproduction, unequal wealth, hire purchase debt, and unregulated banks all made the crash inevitable.</li>
          <li><strong>Black Tuesday (29 Oct 1929):</strong> Over 16 million shares were sold in panic. Share values fell from $87 billion to $30 billion in weeks.</li>
          <li><strong>Devastating consequences:</strong> Over 5,000 banks failed, unemployment hit 25%, and the crash triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li>

Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which underlying economic weaknesses led to the crash.\nExample: Speculation was a major long-term cause. Millions of ordinary Americans bought shares hoping for quick profits. Many bought \u2018on the margin\u2019 \u2014 borrowing money and paying only 10% upfront. By 1929, $8.5 billion had been loaned for share purchases, more than the entire amount of money in circulation in the USA. This created a giant bubble inflated by borrowed money.\n\nAnother example: Overproduction was a long-term weakness. Factories produced far more goods than people could buy. Wages had not risen fast enough for most workers to keep up. By the late 1920s, warehouses filled with unsold cars, fridges, and radios. Businesses started cutting production and laying off workers, which reduced spending power even further.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge.

Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which the crash devastated the American economy.\nExample: Thousands of banks collapsed after the crash. Banks had lent huge sums to investors who could not repay. Between 1929 and 1932, over 5,000 banks failed. Ordinary savers lost all their money because there was no government deposit insurance. Panic spread as people rushed to withdraw cash, causing even more banks to fail.\n\nAnother example: Unemployment soared. As banks collapsed and credit dried up, businesses could not get loans. Factories cut production and shops closed. Unemployment rose from about 1.5 million in 1929 to over 13 million by 1933 \u2014 roughly 25% of the workforce.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: The crash affected Americans at every level, creating a vicious downward spiral. Investors who had bought shares \u2018on the margin\u2019 were ruined \u2014 they owed more than their shares were worth. With $8.5 billion in margin loans outstanding, the losses were catastrophic. Over 5,000 banks failed between 1929 and 1932, wiping out the savings of ordinary Americans who had never invested in shares. With no federal deposit insurance, these savers lost everything. Businesses could not get credit, so they cut production and laid off workers. Industrial production fell nearly 50% by 1933. Unemployment rose from 1.5 million to over 13 million \u2014 25% of the workforce. With no welfare system, unemployed families faced destitution. The psychological impact was also huge: the crash shattered the overconfidence of the 1920s boom. Herbert Hoover had promised \u2018a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage\u2019 \u2014 instead, millions faced poverty. The crash did not affect everyone equally: the wealthy lost paper fortunes, but it was the poorest \u2014 those already struggling before the crash, like farmers and unskilled workers \u2014 who suffered most.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Many investors lost everything because they had bought shares on the margin. Over 5,000 banks also collapsed, meaning ordinary savers lost their deposits. Unemployment rose to 13 million by 1933, and with no welfare system, families had no support.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: Banks collapsed after the crash. Over 5,000 banks failed and people lost all their savings because there was no government insurance.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: People lost their money and jobs after the crash.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: Several interconnected weaknesses combined to make the crash inevitable. Speculation was rampant \u2014 about 1.5 million Americans owned shares, and many bought on the margin with only 10% down. By 1929, $8.5 billion in margin loans inflated a massive bubble. This speculation was possible because Republican laissez-faire meant no regulation of banks or the stock market. Overproduction was another fundamental problem: factories churned out goods at record rates, but with the richest 5% taking 33% of all income and 60% of families earning below $2,000 a year, most Americans could not afford to buy them. Warehouses filled with unsold goods, profits fell, and share prices became disconnected from reality. Hire purchase masked the problem temporarily \u2014 60% of cars and 80% of radios were bought on credit \u2014 but this just meant Americans were piling up debt. Agricultural problems added further weakness: farmers had struggled throughout the 1920s, and when they could not repay loans, rural banks failed. Tariffs like the Fordney-McCumber Tariff (1922) shrank overseas markets. These causes reinforced each other: overproduction led to falling profits, which made shares overvalued, which triggered panic selling when confidence finally broke.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Speculation was a key weakness. Many Americans bought shares on the margin, paying only 10% upfront. By 1929, $8.5 billion had been loaned. Overproduction also weakened the economy \u2014 factories made more goods than people could buy because 60% of families earned less than $2,000 a year.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: Speculation meant people were buying shares with borrowed money, which created a bubble. When prices fell, investors owed more than their shares were worth.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The economy had problems like speculation and overproduction.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both were essential causes, and they were deeply connected. Speculation inflated the stock market bubble: about 1.5 million Americans owned shares, and many bought on the margin with only 10% down. By 1929, $8.5 billion in margin loans had been made \u2014 more than the total money in circulation. When experienced investors began selling in September 1929, margin buyers could not cover their debts, turning a dip into a catastrophic collapse. On Black Tuesday alone, over 16 million shares were dumped. However, the underlying reason share prices were unsustainable was overproduction and unequal wealth. Factories produced more goods than people could buy because 60% of families earned below $2,000 a year and the richest 5% took 33% of income. Warehouses filled with unsold goods, business profits fell, and share prices became disconnected from real value. Speculation was the immediate trigger \u2014 it turned weakness into crisis \u2014 but overproduction and inequality were the fundamental cause. Without them, the stock market would not have been so overvalued in the first place. The crash was inevitable because both sets of causes reinforced each other.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Speculation inflated the bubble. Many Americans bought shares on the margin, paying only 10% upfront. By 1929, $8.5 billion had been loaned. When prices fell, investors were ruined \u2014 on Black Tuesday, 16 million shares were sold in panic.\nExample (bullet 2): Overproduction meant factories made more goods than people could afford. The richest 5% received 33% of income, while 60% of families earned below $2,000. Unsold goods piled up and business profits fell.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Speculation caused the crash because people borrowed money to buy shares. When prices fell, they could not pay back their loans.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The crash was caused by speculation and overproduction.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both were devastating, and the banking collapse was a direct consequence of the stock market crash. Black Thursday (24 October) saw nearly 13 million shares traded in one day as panic selling began. Leading bankers briefly steadied prices, but confidence was shattered. Black Tuesday (29 October) was the worst day \u2014 over 16 million shares were sold in panic, and margin investors were ruined. By mid-November, the market had lost about $30 billion. However, the banking collapse arguably had a deeper and longer-lasting impact on ordinary Americans. Banks had lent huge sums to investors and also gambled with customers\u2019 deposits on the stock market. Over 5,000 banks failed between 1929 and 1932. With no federal deposit insurance, ordinary savers lost everything \u2014 not just investors, but families who had never bought a share. Panic bank runs caused even solvent banks to fail. Without functioning banks, businesses could not get loans, factories closed, and unemployment rose from 1.5 million to 13 million. The stock market crash was the trigger, but the banking collapse turned a financial crisis into the Great Depression that devastated the entire economy for years.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Black Thursday and Black Tuesday wiped out investors. On Black Tuesday, over 16 million shares were sold and prices collapsed. By mid-November the market had lost $30 billion. Margin investors were ruined because they owed more than their shares were worth.\nExample (bullet 2): Over 5,000 banks collapsed between 1929 and 1932. Ordinary savers lost all their money because there was no government deposit insurance. Without banks, businesses could not get loans and millions lost their jobs.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: On Black Tuesday over 16 million shares were sold and the market lost billions of dollars. Many investors were completely ruined.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The stock market crashed and banks failed, which caused the Depression.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."
