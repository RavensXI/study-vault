        <h2>The Scale of the Depression</h2>

        <p>The <strong>Great Depression</strong> was the worst economic crisis in American history, lasting from 1929 to the late 1930s. Following the Wall Street Crash, the American economy went into a devastating downward spiral. Businesses closed, banks failed, and millions of people lost their jobs, homes, and savings. The suffering was widespread and severe, affecting almost every part of American society.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Depression in Numbers</div>
          <p>By <strong>1933</strong> &mdash; the worst year of the Depression &mdash; around <strong>13 million Americans</strong> were unemployed (roughly <strong>25%</strong> of the workforce). Industrial production had fallen by nearly <strong>50%</strong>. Over <strong>5,000 banks</strong> had collapsed. National income had dropped from <strong>$87 billion</strong> in 1929 to <strong>$40 billion</strong> in 1933. Around <strong>1&ndash;2 million</strong> Americans were homeless.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Unemployment and Poverty</h2>

        <p>The most immediate and devastating effect of the Depression was mass unemployment. With no national welfare system, no unemployment insurance, and no government safety net, losing your job meant losing everything.</p>

        <h3>The Human Cost</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>By 1933, <strong>one in four workers</strong> was unemployed. In some industrial cities, the figure was far higher &mdash; in <strong>Toledo, Ohio</strong>, unemployment reached <strong>80%</strong>; in <strong>Cleveland</strong>, it hit <strong>50%</strong>.</li>
          <li>Those who kept their jobs often had their wages cut dramatically. Average wages fell by <strong>60%</strong> between 1929 and 1933.</li>
          <li>Families lost their homes when they could no longer pay rent or mortgage payments. <strong>250,000 families</strong> had their homes repossessed in 1932 alone.</li>
          <li>Millions of Americans went hungry. Breadlines and soup kitchens appeared in every major city, run by charities since the government provided no food aid.</li>
          <li>Malnutrition, disease, and mental illness increased sharply. Suicide rates rose by <strong>30%</strong> between 1929 and 1932.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hoovervilles</h2>

        <p>As homeless Americans were forced from their homes, many built makeshift shelters on waste ground, in parks, and on the edges of towns. These shanty towns were called <strong>&lsquo;Hoovervilles&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; a bitter, mocking reference to President <strong>Herbert Hoover</strong>, whom many blamed for the Depression and for failing to help.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Hoovervilles</div>
          <p>Hoovervilles sprang up across America. They were built from whatever materials people could find &mdash; scrap wood, tin, cardboard, and old car parts. The largest Hooverville, in <strong>Central Park, New York</strong>, housed hundreds of people. Others appeared in <strong>Seattle, Washington D.C., St Louis</strong>, and virtually every major city. Other bitter nicknames emerged: newspapers used as blankets were called <strong>&lsquo;Hoover blankets&rsquo;</strong>, empty pockets turned inside out were <strong>&lsquo;Hoover flags&rsquo;</strong>, and broken-down cars pulled by horses were <strong>&lsquo;Hoover wagons&rsquo;</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>President Hoover&rsquo;s Response</h2>

        <p><strong>Herbert Hoover</strong> was President when the Crash struck and believed the Depression would be short-lived. His response was widely seen as inadequate:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Hoover believed in <strong>&lsquo;rugged individualism&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; the idea that Americans should help themselves rather than rely on government handouts. He feared that direct government relief would make people lazy and dependent.</li>
          <li>He encouraged <strong>voluntary action</strong> &mdash; asking businesses not to cut wages and urging charities to help the poor. But voluntary measures were nowhere near enough to address the scale of the crisis.</li>
          <li>In 1932, he finally set up the <strong>Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC)</strong>, which lent money to banks and businesses. However, this was seen as helping the rich while ordinary people starved.</li>
          <li>He raised tariffs with the <strong>Hawley-Smoot Tariff</strong> (1930), which actually <strong>worsened</strong> the Depression by reducing international trade as other countries retaliated with their own tariffs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bonus Army, 1932</h2>

        <p>In the summer of <strong>1932</strong>, around <strong>20,000 World War One veterans</strong> and their families marched on Washington D.C. They were demanding early payment of a <strong>bonus</strong> they had been promised for their war service, which was not due to be paid until 1945. These veterans, many unemployed and desperate, set up a camp of tents and shacks near the Capitol building and called themselves the <strong>Bonus Expeditionary Force</strong> (or <strong>Bonus Army</strong>).</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Bonus Army Incident</div>
          <p>When the Senate rejected the bill to pay the bonus early, most veterans refused to leave. Hoover ordered the <strong>US Army</strong>, led by General <strong>Douglas MacArthur</strong>, to clear the camp. Soldiers used <strong>tear gas, bayonets, and tanks</strong> to drive the veterans and their families out, burning their shelters. Two veterans were killed and over <strong>1,000 were injured</strong>, including women and children. The sight of the US Army attacking its own war heroes horrified the nation and destroyed what was left of Hoover&rsquo;s reputation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Dust Bowl</h2>

        <p>While the Depression devastated cities, a separate catastrophe struck rural America. The <strong>Dust Bowl</strong> was an ecological disaster that affected the <strong>Great Plains</strong> states &mdash; including <strong>Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico</strong> &mdash; throughout the 1930s.</p>

        <h3>Causes of the Dust Bowl</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Over-farming:</strong> During WWI and the 1920s, farmers had ploughed up vast areas of natural grassland to plant wheat and cotton, stripping the soil of its protective covering.</li>
          <li><strong>Drought:</strong> A severe drought hit the Great Plains from 1931, lasting most of the decade. Without rain, the exposed topsoil dried out completely.</li>
          <li><strong>Dust storms:</strong> Massive windstorms picked up the loose topsoil, creating enormous &lsquo;black blizzards&rsquo; of dust that could travel hundreds of miles. On <strong>&lsquo;Black Sunday&rsquo; (14 April 1935)</strong>, dust storms swept across the Plains, turning day into night.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact on Farmers</h3>
        <p>The Dust Bowl destroyed farming across a vast area. Crops failed completely, livestock died, and the land became useless. An estimated <strong>2.5 million people</strong> left the Dust Bowl states. Many headed west to <strong>California</strong>, where they were known as <strong>&lsquo;Okies&rsquo;</strong> (regardless of which state they came from). They often found only low-paid, seasonal work picking fruit and vegetables, and faced discrimination and hostility from local residents.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Scale of the Dust Bowl</div>
          <p>At its peak, the Dust Bowl affected <strong>100 million acres</strong> of land across multiple states. Dust storms sometimes reached as far as <strong>New York and Washington D.C.</strong>, depositing Great Plains soil on the desks of politicians thousands of miles away. The disaster demonstrated how environmental mismanagement could compound economic crisis.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Different Groups</h2>

        <div class="collapsible">

            <span>How the Depression affected different groups</span>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>African Americans:</strong> Already the poorest group before the Depression, African Americans were hit hardest. They were the <strong>&lsquo;last hired, first fired&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; unemployment among Black workers reached <strong>50%</strong> in many cities, roughly double the national average. In the South, Black sharecroppers were evicted from land as farm income collapsed. Racial violence and lynchings continued, and there was virtually no government help directed at Black communities.</p>
              <p><strong>Hispanic Americans:</strong> Many Mexican Americans were forced or pressured to leave the country during the Depression through a programme of <strong>&lsquo;repatriation.&rsquo;</strong> An estimated <strong>500,000&ndash;1 million</strong> people of Mexican descent (including many US citizens) were deported or pressured to leave between 1929 and 1936.</p>
              <p><strong>Women:</strong> Women who worked were often accused of &lsquo;stealing&rsquo; jobs from men. Many employers refused to hire married women, and some states passed laws banning them from government jobs. However, some women found work in service industries (domestic work, waitressing) that men considered beneath them.</p>
              <p><strong>Children:</strong> Many children were pulled out of school to work or beg. Malnutrition was widespread &mdash; in some mining communities, <strong>90% of children</strong> were malnourished. Thousands of teenagers became <strong>&lsquo;hobos&rsquo;</strong>, riding freight trains around the country looking for work.</p>
              <p><strong>Farmers:</strong> Between the falling prices, bank foreclosures, and the Dust Bowl, farming communities were devastated. Thousands of families lost farms that had been in their families for generations.</p>

        <p>Questions about the Depression often ask you to explain the <strong>impact on different groups</strong>. Make sure you can discuss the experiences of <strong>urban workers, farmers, African Americans, and women</strong> separately, with specific evidence for each. Remember that Hoover&rsquo;s failure to act effectively is a key part of the story &mdash; it explains why Americans voted for change in 1932 and why Roosevelt&rsquo;s New Deal was so significant.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Great Depression was a catastrophe of unprecedented scale. By 1933, 13 million Americans were unemployed, thousands of banks had failed, and millions had lost their homes and savings. The human suffering was immense &mdash; from the Hoovervilles of the cities to the dust storms of the Plains. President Hoover&rsquo;s belief in &lsquo;rugged individualism&rsquo; left him unable or unwilling to provide the help that desperate Americans needed. The Bonus Army incident symbolised his failure, and the stage was set for a dramatic change of direction under Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Devastating unemployment:</strong> 13 million unemployed by 1933 (25% of the workforce), with no welfare system to support them.</li>
          <li><strong>Hoover&rsquo;s failure:</strong> His belief in rugged individualism and voluntary action was completely inadequate. The Bonus Army incident (1932) destroyed his reputation.</li>
          <li><strong>The Dust Bowl:</strong> An ecological disaster that compounded the economic crisis, displacing 2.5 million people from the Great Plains.</li>
          <li><strong>Unequal suffering:</strong> African Americans, Hispanic Americans, women, and children were disproportionately affected by the Depression.</li>
        </ul>
