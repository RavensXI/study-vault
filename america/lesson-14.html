        <h2>De Facto Segregation in the North</h2>

        <p>The Civil Rights Act (1964) and Voting Rights Act (1965) had dismantled <dfn class="term" data-def="Segregation that is imposed by law, as was the case with Jim Crow laws in the Southern states. De jure segregation was made illegal by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.">de jure</dfn> (legal) segregation in the South. However, <dfn class="term" data-def="Segregation that exists in practice, even though it is not imposed by law. In Northern cities, de facto segregation resulted from housing discrimination, white flight, and economic inequality, creating racially divided neighbourhoods, schools, and communities.">de facto</dfn> segregation &mdash; segregation in practice, if not in law &mdash; was deeply entrenched in Northern and Western cities. This proved far harder to tackle than legal segregation, because it was caused by <strong>economic inequality, housing discrimination, and deeply rooted social patterns</strong> rather than specific laws that could be overturned.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Northern Segregation</div>
          <p>In Northern cities, Black Americans were concentrated in <strong>inner-city ghettos</strong> &mdash; overcrowded, under-resourced neighbourhoods with poor housing, high crime, inadequate schools, and few job opportunities. This was caused by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Redlining:</strong> Banks and insurance companies refused to lend money or provide services in predominantly Black neighbourhoods, trapping residents in poverty</li>
            <li><strong>White flight:</strong> As Black families moved into neighbourhoods, white families moved to the suburbs, taking businesses, tax revenue, and investment with them</li>
            <li><strong>Restrictive covenants:</strong> Property deeds included clauses preventing the sale of homes to Black buyers, maintaining racially segregated housing patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Employment discrimination:</strong> Despite the Civil Rights Act, Black workers still faced discrimination in hiring and were disproportionately concentrated in low-paid jobs</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Urban Riots of the 1960s</h3>

        <p>The frustrations of life in Northern ghettos had already erupted in devastating <strong>urban riots</strong> during the mid-1960s. These riots continued to shape attitudes in the early 1970s:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Watts, Los Angeles (1965):</strong> Six days of rioting left <strong>34 dead</strong>, over 1,000 injured, and caused $40 million in damage</li>
          <li><strong>Detroit (1967):</strong> Five days of rioting killed <strong>43 people</strong> and required the deployment of federal troops and tanks</li>
          <li><strong>Nationwide riots (1968):</strong> Following MLK&rsquo;s assassination, riots erupted in over <strong>100 cities</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The <dfn class="term" data-def="A commission established by President Johnson in 1967 to investigate the causes of the urban riots. Its report, published in 1968, concluded that America was 'moving toward two societies, one black, one white &mdash; separate and unequal.' It blamed white racism and recommended massive government investment in housing, education, and employment in Black communities.">Kerner Commission</dfn>, established by President Johnson to investigate the riots, concluded in 1968 that America was <em>&ldquo;moving toward two societies, one black, one white &mdash; separate and unequal.&rdquo;</em> It blamed <strong>white racism</strong> for the conditions that caused the riots and recommended massive investment in housing, education, and jobs. Most of its recommendations were <strong>never implemented</strong>.</p>

        <h2>The Busing Controversy</h2>

        <p>Because residential segregation meant that Black and white children attended different neighbourhood schools, the Supreme Court ruled in <strong>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg (1971)</strong> that <dfn class="term" data-def="The practice of transporting students by bus to schools outside their local neighbourhood in order to achieve racial integration. Busing was ordered by the courts in the early 1970s but faced fierce opposition, particularly from white parents in Northern cities like Boston, who saw it as an infringement on their right to choose their children's schools.">busing</dfn> &mdash; transporting students to schools outside their local area &mdash; could be used to achieve racial integration.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p>The most notorious conflict over busing occurred in <strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>, beginning in 1974. When a federal judge ordered the busing of Black students to schools in the predominantly white, working-class neighbourhood of <strong>South Boston</strong>, the response was ferocious:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>White parents organised <strong>massive boycotts</strong>, keeping thousands of children out of school</li>
                <li>Black students arriving at South Boston High School were met with <strong>mobs throwing rocks and bottles</strong></li>
                <li>A famous photograph showed a white man using an American flag as a weapon to attack a Black bystander &mdash; an image that shocked the nation</li>
                <li>Violence continued for <strong>several years</strong>, requiring the presence of hundreds of police officers</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The Boston crisis demonstrated that <strong>racial hostility was not limited to the South</strong>. Northern white communities could be just as resistant to integration as Southern ones, especially when it directly affected their children&rsquo;s schools.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Economic Inequality</h2>

        <p>Despite legal gains, the <strong>economic gap</strong> between Black and white Americans remained vast in the early 1970s.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Economic Divide</div>
          <ul>
            <li>In 1970, the median income of Black families was <strong>61%</strong> of the median income of white families</li>
            <li>Black unemployment was consistently <strong>twice</strong> the rate of white unemployment</li>
            <li>Over <strong>30%</strong> of Black Americans lived below the poverty line, compared to around 10% of white Americans</li>
            <li>Black Americans were disproportionately affected by the <strong>economic recession</strong> of the early 1970s, as they were often the &ldquo;last hired, first fired&rdquo;</li>
            <li>The poverty rate for Black children was <strong>over 40%</strong></li>
          </ul>

        <h2>The Legacy of the Black Panthers</h2>

        <p>By the early 1970s, the <dfn class="term" data-def="A revolutionary Black nationalist organisation founded in Oakland, California, in 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. The Black Panthers combined community programmes (free breakfasts, health clinics) with armed self-defence and radical political ideology. They were targeted by the FBI's COINTELPRO programme and many leaders were killed or imprisoned.">Black Panther Party</dfn> had been severely weakened by the FBI&rsquo;s <dfn class="term" data-def="The Counter Intelligence Programme, a series of covert and often illegal operations run by the FBI under Director J. Edgar Hoover from 1956 to 1971. COINTELPRO targeted civil rights groups, Black Power organisations, and anti-war activists through surveillance, infiltration, disinformation, and harassment. Its most aggressive operations were directed at the Black Panthers.">COINTELPRO</dfn> programme, which used infiltration, surveillance, disinformation, and outright assassination to destroy the organisation. Key leaders were killed, imprisoned, or driven into exile:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fred Hampton</strong>, the charismatic 21-year-old head of the Chicago chapter, was <strong>shot and killed</strong> by police in a pre-dawn raid on 4 December 1969</li>
          <li><strong>Huey Newton</strong> was imprisoned, and <strong>Bobby Seale</strong> faced criminal charges</li>
          <li><strong>Eldridge Cleaver</strong> fled to Algeria to avoid prosecution</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Despite their destruction, the Black Panthers left a lasting legacy. Their <strong>community programmes</strong> &mdash; particularly the Free Breakfast for Children programme, which served up to <strong>10,000 children daily</strong> &mdash; were later adopted as models by the federal government. Their emphasis on <strong>Black pride, self-determination, and community empowerment</strong> continued to influence Black political thought.</p>

        <h2>Affirmative Action</h2>

        <p>To address the continuing effects of centuries of discrimination, the government introduced <dfn class="term" data-def="Policies that take race, gender, or other factors into account to benefit underrepresented groups in areas such as employment, education, and government contracts. Affirmative action was introduced through executive orders by Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and expanded by Nixon. It remains one of the most controversial aspects of the civil rights legacy.">affirmative action</dfn> &mdash; policies designed to increase representation of minorities and women in employment, education, and government contracts.</p>

                <li>Some argued it undermined the achievements of successful Black Americans by suggesting they needed <strong>special help</strong></li>
                <li>White working-class Americans, who had not personally benefited from historical privilege, resented being disadvantaged by policies designed to help others</li>

        <h2>Continuing Challenges</h2>

        <p>By the early 1970s, the civil rights movement had achieved remarkable legal and political victories. However, the <strong>deeper problems</strong> of poverty, housing segregation, educational inequality, and institutional racism proved far more resistant to change. The optimism of the early 1960s had given way to a more sober recognition that changing laws was only the <strong>first step</strong> in a much longer struggle for genuine equality.</p>

        <p>A key exam theme is the <strong>difference between de jure and de facto segregation</strong>. Make sure you can explain why <strong>legal changes alone were not enough</strong> to achieve genuine equality. The Civil Rights Act could outlaw segregation in law, but it could not fix housing discrimination, poverty, or deeply embedded racism in Northern cities. Top answers will explain why the problems of the 1970s proved <strong>harder to solve</strong> than the legal segregation of the South, using specific examples like busing, redlining, and economic statistics.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1970s revealed the limits of the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. While legal segregation had been dismantled, de facto segregation in housing, education, and employment proved far more resistant to change. Northern cities were deeply divided along racial lines, and the busing controversy showed that racism was a national problem, not just a Southern one. The economic gap between Black and white Americans remained vast, with Black families earning barely 60% of white family income. Affirmative action attempted to address structural inequality but sparked fierce controversy. The Black Panthers had been destroyed by government repression, and the optimism of the civil rights era had given way to a sobering recognition that the struggle for genuine equality was far from over.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>De facto segregation</strong> in the North proved harder to tackle than legal segregation in the South, because it was caused by economic inequality, housing discrimination, and social patterns rather than specific laws.</li>
          <li><strong>The busing controversy</strong> showed that Northern white communities could be just as resistant to integration as Southern ones.</li>
          <li><strong>Economic inequality</strong> remained stark: Black family income was 61% of white income, Black unemployment was double the white rate, and over 30% of Black Americans lived in poverty.</li>
          <li><strong>Affirmative action</strong> attempted to address structural disadvantage but created political divisions that persist to this day.</li>
          <li><strong>The Kerner Commission&rsquo;s warning</strong> of &ldquo;two societies, one black, one white &mdash; separate and unequal&rdquo; remained alarmingly accurate.</li>
