        <h2>The Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement</h2>

        <p>The civil rights movement inspired other groups to fight for their rights. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A broad social and political movement that emerged in the 1960s, campaigning for gender equality in areas including employment, pay, education, reproductive rights, and legal status.">women&rsquo;s liberation movement</dfn> &mdash; sometimes called &ldquo;second-wave feminism&rdquo; &mdash; became one of the most powerful social movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Women had won the right to <strong>vote</strong> in 1920 with the 19th Amendment, but they still faced deep inequality in employment, pay, education, and the law.</p>

        <h3>The Roots of Discontent</h3>

        <p>The seeds of the movement were planted during <strong>World War Two</strong>. Around <strong>6 million women</strong> worked in factories during the war, gaining independence and skills. But when the soldiers returned, most women were sacked and pushed back into domestic roles. This created a sense of frustration that would build for two decades.</p>

        <h3>The Problem with No Name</h3>

        <p>In <strong>1963</strong>, <dfn class="term" data-def="An American feminist writer and activist whose 1963 book The Feminine Mystique challenged the idea that women could find fulfilment solely through housework and motherhood.">Betty Friedan</dfn> &mdash; a psychologist and journalist &mdash; published <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>. The book challenged the idea that women could only find fulfilment through being housewives and mothers. Friedan described the deep frustration felt by millions of educated, middle-class women trapped in domestic roles as &ldquo;the problem that has no name.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The book sold over <strong>3 million copies</strong>. It struck a chord with women across the country who felt unfulfilled but had been told they should be grateful for their comfortable lives. Friedan argued that society was wasting the talents of half its population by confining women to the home.</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_womens_inequality_1960s.png" alt="Infographic showing gender inequality statistics in 1960s America — women earned 60 cents per dollar, 95% of managers were men, only 6% of doctors and 3% of lawyers were women, and women faced legal discrimination in employment and credit">
        </figure>

        <h2>The Fight for Equal Pay</h2>

        <p>One of the central demands was <strong>equal pay for equal work</strong>. The pay gap was huge, and it was entirely legal for employers to pay women less simply because of their sex.</p>

        <h3>The Equal Pay Act (1963)</h3>

        <p>President Kennedy signed the <dfn class="term" data-def="A federal law passed in 1963 that required employers to pay men and women equally for performing the same work under similar conditions.">Equal Pay Act</dfn> in June <strong>1963</strong>. It made it illegal to pay men and women different wages for the same work. This was the first federal law to tackle sex-based pay discrimination.</p>

        <p>However, the Act had <strong>serious limitations</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It only covered jobs that were <strong>exactly the same</strong> &mdash; employers got around it by giving men and women slightly different job titles</li>
          <li><strong>Enforcement was weak</strong> &mdash; the government lacked resources to investigate millions of employers</li>
          <li>It did not address the deeper problem: women were <strong>concentrated in low-paid jobs</strong> like teaching, nursing, and secretarial work, while better-paid professions stayed male-dominated</li>
          <li>By <strong>1973</strong>, women still earned only about <strong>57 cents</strong> for every dollar earned by men &mdash; the gap had actually <em>widened</em> slightly</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (1964)</h3>

        <p>A more powerful tool came with <strong>Title VII</strong> of the Civil Rights Act (1964), which banned employment discrimination based on <strong>sex</strong> as well as race. Ironically, a Southern congressman, <strong>Howard W. Smith</strong>, added the word &ldquo;sex&rdquo; hoping it would make the bill fail &mdash; but it passed anyway.</p>

        <p>Title VII created the <dfn class="term" data-def="The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency established by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to enforce laws against workplace discrimination based on race, colour, religion, sex, or national origin.">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</dfn> to handle discrimination complaints. But the EEOC did not take sex discrimination seriously at first &mdash; its director called the sex provision a &ldquo;fluke&rdquo; and the agency focused almost entirely on race. This failure to enforce the law was a key reason Betty Friedan and others formed a new organisation to fight for women&rsquo;s rights.</p>

        <h2>The National Organization for Women (NOW)</h2>

        <p>In <strong>1966</strong>, Betty Friedan and 27 others founded the <dfn class="term" data-def="The National Organization for Women, founded in 1966 by Betty Friedan and others, became the leading women&rsquo;s rights organisation in America.">National Organization for Women (NOW)</dfn>. It became the largest and most influential feminist organisation in America. NOW was professional and well-organised, with around <strong>40,000 mainly middle-class members</strong> by the mid-1970s. It fought for change through the courts, lobbying Congress, and public campaigns.</p>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Key campaigns:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Pressured the EEOC to <strong>enforce Title VII</strong> on sex discrimination &mdash; filing lawsuits and protesting outside EEOC offices</li>
                <li>Campaigned to end <strong>sex-segregated job adverts</strong> (&ldquo;Help Wanted &mdash; Male&rdquo; / &ldquo;Female&rdquo;). By 1968, the EEOC ruled these were illegal</li>
                <li>Pushed for <strong>affordable childcare</strong> so mothers could work</li>
                <li>Campaigned for <strong>reproductive rights</strong>, including access to the <strong>contraceptive pill</strong> &mdash; which allowed women to plan when to have families &mdash; and abortion</li>
                <li>Led the fight for the <strong>Equal Rights Amendment</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>By <strong>1971</strong>, NOW had <strong>15,000 members</strong>, growing to over <strong>40,000</strong> by the mid-1970s. Its tactics were inspired by the civil rights movement: marches, court cases, and lobbying.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>The Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement &mdash; A More Radical Wing</h3>

        <p>Alongside NOW, a more radical wing emerged: the <strong>Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement</strong> (&ldquo;Women&rsquo;s Lib&rdquo;). These were mostly younger women who saw NOW as too cautious. They used confrontational tactics &mdash; burning bras, disrupting the <strong>Miss World</strong> pageant, and staging dramatic protests to grab media attention. While NOW worked through courts and Congress, Women&rsquo;s Lib aimed to shock society into change.</p>

        <h2>Gloria Steinem and <em>Ms.</em> Magazine</h2>

        <p>While Friedan was the movement&rsquo;s intellectual founder, <dfn class="term" data-def="An American journalist, feminist, and political activist who became one of the most recognisable leaders of the women&rsquo;s liberation movement.">Gloria Steinem</dfn> became its most visible public face. She used her media skills to bring feminist ideas to a mass audience.</p>

        <p>In <strong>January 1972</strong>, Steinem co-founded <em>Ms.</em> magazine &mdash; the first mainstream magazine run by women, for women, with a <strong>feminist perspective</strong>. The preview issue sold all <strong>300,000 copies</strong> in eight days. <em>Ms.</em> covered domestic violence, sexual harassment, pay inequality, and reproductive rights &mdash; topics other magazines ignored. It proved there was a huge audience of women hungry for content that took their concerns seriously.</p>

        <p>Steinem also testified before Congress for the Equal Rights Amendment and co-founded the <strong>National Women&rsquo;s Political Caucus</strong> (1971), which worked to elect more women to office.</p>

        <p>The Supreme Court ruled <strong>unanimously</strong> that this violated the <strong>Equal Protection Clause</strong> of the 14th Amendment. It was the <strong>first time</strong> the Court had struck down a law for sex discrimination. This opened the door to further legal challenges and was used as a precedent in many later cases.</p>

        <h3>Title IX (1972)</h3>

        <p><dfn class="term" data-def="A federal law passed in 1972 that banned sex discrimination in any educational programme or activity receiving federal funding.">Title IX</dfn> (1972) banned sex discrimination in any educational programme receiving federal funding. Its impact was dramatic:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Universities could no longer use <strong>quotas to limit female students</strong></li>
          <li>Schools had to offer <strong>equal sports opportunities</strong> &mdash; girls in high school sports rose from <strong>300,000 in 1972</strong> to over <strong>2 million by 1978</strong></li>
          <li>More women entered law, medicine, and business courses &mdash; female law school enrolment jumped from <strong>4%</strong> to <strong>26%</strong> in a decade</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Roe v. Wade (1973)</h3>

        <p>In January <strong>1973</strong>, the Supreme Court delivered one of the most controversial rulings in American history. In <dfn class="term" data-def="A landmark 1973 Supreme Court case that ruled women had a constitutional right to an abortion in the early stages of pregnancy, based on the right to privacy under the 14th Amendment.">Roe v. Wade</dfn>, the court ruled <strong>7&ndash;2</strong> that women had a constitutional right to <strong>abortion</strong> in early pregnancy, based on the right to privacy under the 14th Amendment.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Roe v. Wade</div>
          <p>The ruling set a framework based on the <strong>three trimesters</strong> of pregnancy:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>First trimester:</strong> The decision was left to the woman and her doctor</li>
            <li><strong>Second trimester:</strong> States could regulate abortion to protect the mother&rsquo;s health</li>
            <li><strong>Third trimester:</strong> States could ban abortion, as the foetus was viable (able to survive outside the womb)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Feminists celebrated this as a victory for women&rsquo;s control over their own bodies. Opponents &mdash; especially religious conservatives &mdash; condemned it. The ruling triggered a <strong>powerful anti-abortion movement</strong> that shaped American politics for decades.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Other Key Gains for Women</h2>

        <p>Two further changes transformed women&rsquo;s lives in this period:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>contraceptive pill</strong> &mdash; approved in 1960 and widely available by the late 1960s &mdash; gave women control over when to have children. This opened up career and education opportunities that had been almost impossible before</li>
          <li><strong>No-fault divorce laws</strong> &mdash; introduced by several states from 1969 &mdash; made it easier for women to leave unhappy marriages without having to prove their husband was at fault</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)</h2>

        <p>The most ambitious goal of the feminist movement was the <dfn class="term" data-def="A proposed amendment to the US Constitution that would have guaranteed equal legal rights regardless of sex.">Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)</dfn>. It would have added a simple statement to the Constitution: <em>&ldquo;Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.&rdquo;</em></p>

        <p>The ERA was first proposed in <strong>1923</strong>, shortly after women won the vote. It was reintroduced in every session of Congress for nearly 50 years before finally passing in <strong>March 1972</strong>. It then needed to be <dfn class="term" data-def="The process by which a proposed amendment to the Constitution is approved by the states.">ratified</dfn> by <strong>38 of the 50 states</strong> to become part of the Constitution.</p>

        <p>At first, the ERA seemed certain to succeed. Within the first year, <strong>30 states</strong> ratified it. Then the process stalled dramatically.</p>

        <h3>Phyllis Schlafly and the STOP ERA Campaign</h3>

              <p>The most effective opponent was <dfn class="term" data-def="An American conservative activist and author who led the campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s.">Phyllis Schlafly</dfn>, a conservative activist from Illinois. Schlafly was both a housewife <em>and</em> a qualified lawyer &mdash; and had once run for Congress herself and lost, which was ironic given her argument that women belonged in the home. In <strong>1972</strong>, she founded the <strong>STOP ERA</strong> campaign (STOP stood for &ldquo;Stop Taking Our Privileges&rdquo;).</p>
              <p>Schlafly argued the ERA would:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Force women into military combat</strong> &mdash; a powerful argument during Vietnam, when the draft was deeply unpopular</li>
                <li><strong>End separate toilets and changing rooms</strong> for men and women</li>
                <li><strong>Remove protections</strong> women already had in divorce law, such as alimony and child custody</li>
                <li><strong>Undermine the traditional family</strong> by suggesting motherhood was not valued</li>
                <li>Lead to <strong>taxpayer-funded abortions</strong> and same-sex marriage</li>
              </ul>
              <p>She mobilised <strong>conservative women</strong>, many of them religious Christians, who felt feminism <em>attacked</em> their way of life. Her supporters baked bread and jams for state legislators with notes saying: <em>&ldquo;From the breadmakers to the breadwinners.&rdquo;</em></p>
              <p>The campaign was remarkably successful. The ERA <strong>stalled at 35 states</strong> &mdash; three short of the 38 needed. Despite a deadline extension to <strong>1982</strong>, no further states ratified it. Five states even voted to <strong>rescind</strong> (take back) their ratification.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why the ERA Failed</div>
          <p>The ERA&rsquo;s failure showed the <strong>limits of the feminist movement</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Schlafly&rsquo;s campaign <strong>frightened many women</strong> who feared losing protections they already had</li>
            <li>The movement was seen as representing <strong>educated, middle-class, white women</strong> &mdash; not working-class or minority women</li>
            <li>Opposition from <strong>religious conservatives</strong> in Southern and rural states proved impossible to overcome</li>
            <li>The broader <strong>conservative backlash</strong> of the late 1970s shifted the political mood to the right</li>

              <p><strong>Legal victories:</strong> The Equal Pay Act, Title VII, Title IX, Reed v. Reed, and Roe v. Wade gave women far greater legal protection. Sex discrimination in employment and education was now illegal.</p>
              <p><strong>Changed attitudes:</strong> The idea that women should have the same opportunities as men became widely accepted, even if reality lagged behind.</p>
              <p><strong>Workforce:</strong> By 1973, over <strong>44%</strong> of women were in paid work, up from around 34% in 1950.</p>
              <p><strong>Education:</strong> Title IX opened universities and professional schools to women. Female enrolment surged.</p>
              <p><strong>Politics:</strong> The <strong>National Women&rsquo;s Political Caucus</strong> (1971) helped elect more women to office. Women&rsquo;s issues became a permanent part of political debate.</p>

        <p>The examiner wants a <strong>balanced assessment</strong>. Acknowledge the legal victories (Equal Pay Act, Title VII, Title IX, Roe v. Wade, Reed v. Reed) but explain why these <strong>did not fully solve</strong> gender inequality. Discuss the <strong>opposition</strong> &mdash; especially Schlafly and STOP ERA. Top marks go to answers that explain <strong>why</strong> the ERA failed and what this reveals about the limits of social change. Mention the two wings of the movement: NOW (professional, court cases) and Women&rsquo;s Lib (radical, confrontational).</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The feminist movement achieved real progress. Friedan&rsquo;s <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> and NOW sparked a national campaign for equality, while the more radical Women&rsquo;s Lib wing grabbed public attention. The Equal Pay Act, Title VII, Title IX, the contraceptive pill, and no-fault divorce laws all changed women&rsquo;s lives. The Supreme Court&rsquo;s rulings in Reed v. Reed and Roe v. Wade set important constitutional protections. Yet limits remained. The pay gap barely narrowed, <strong>95%</strong> of managers were still men, and Schlafly&rsquo;s campaign defeated the ERA. By 1973, the legal framework for equality was largely in place, but genuine equality in everyday life was still a distant goal.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Friedan&rsquo;s <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> (1963)</strong> and <strong>NOW (1966)</strong> launched the movement. NOW fought through courts and lobbying; the Women&rsquo;s Lib wing used radical protest.</li>
          <li><strong>Reed v. Reed (1971)</strong> was the first Supreme Court ruling to strike down a law for sex discrimination, using the 14th Amendment.</li>
          <li><strong>Roe v. Wade (1973)</strong> gave women a right to abortion but triggered a powerful conservative backlash that shaped politics for decades.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: The feminist movement affected different groups of American women in different ways. For middle-class, educated women, Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique (1963) articulated \u2018the problem that has no name\u2019 \u2014 the frustration of being trapped in domestic roles. NOW (founded 1966) fought through courts and lobbying, pressuring the EEOC to enforce Title VII on sex discrimination and ending sex-segregated job adverts by 1968. Title IX (1972) transformed education: girls in high school sports rose from 300,000 to over 2 million by 1978, and female law school enrolment jumped from 4% to 26%. Roe v. Wade (1973) gave women a constitutional right to abortion. However, for working-class and minority women, the impact was more limited. The pay gap barely narrowed \u2014 women earned only 57 cents per dollar by 1973, with Black women at 49 cents and Hispanic women at 45 cents. The ERA\u2019s failure showed the movement\u2019s limits. For conservative women, the movement was threatening: Schlafly\u2019s STOP ERA campaign mobilised those who saw feminism as attacking their way of life. The movement changed laws and attitudes but did not achieve full equality.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Title IX (1972) banned sex discrimination in education, dramatically increasing women\u2019s access to universities and sports. Roe v. Wade (1973) gave women a constitutional right to abortion. However, the pay gap remained: women still earned only 57 cents per dollar by 1973, and Schlafly\u2019s STOP ERA campaign prevented the Equal Rights Amendment from being ratified.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: The Equal Pay Act (1963) made it illegal to pay men and women differently for the same work, which was the first federal law to address sex-based pay discrimination.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The feminist movement helped women get equal rights.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: The legal victories had significant but uneven effects on women\u2019s lives. The Equal Pay Act (1963) established the principle of equal pay for equal work, but enforcement was weak and employers circumvented it by giving men and women slightly different job titles. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (1964) banned sex discrimination in employment, but the EEOC initially refused to take sex discrimination seriously \u2014 its director called the sex provision a \u2018fluke.\u2019 This failure directly led to the creation of NOW in 1966. Reed v. Reed (1971) was the first Supreme Court ruling to strike down a law for sex discrimination, using the 14th Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. Title IX (1972) had the most immediate visible impact: universities could no longer limit female students through quotas, and girls\u2019 participation in high school sports rose from 300,000 to over 2 million by 1978. Roe v. Wade (1973) gave women control over reproductive choices but triggered a powerful anti-abortion movement. The cumulative effect was that by 1973, sex discrimination was illegal in employment and education, but the pay gap (57 cents per dollar) and the glass ceiling showed that changing laws was easier than changing reality.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Reed v. Reed (1971) was the first time the Supreme Court struck down a law for sex discrimination, opening the door to further legal challenges. Title IX (1972) transformed education for women, with female law school enrolment jumping from 4% to 26% in a decade and girls in high school sports rising from 300,000 to over 2 million.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: Roe v. Wade (1973) gave women a constitutional right to abortion in early pregnancy, meaning they had more control over their own bodies.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: New laws made it illegal to discriminate against women at work.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        text: "Which of the following had more impact on improving women\u2019s rights in America:\n\n\u2022 the actions of NOW and Betty Friedan\n\u2022 changes in the law and Supreme Court rulings?\n\nExplain your answer with reference to both bullet points.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: NOW and legal changes were deeply interconnected \u2014 NOW\u2019s campaigning directly produced many of the legal victories. Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique (1963) sold 3 million copies and sparked the movement. NOW (founded 1966) then pressured the EEOC to enforce Title VII on sex discrimination, filed lawsuits, and campaigned to end sex-segregated job adverts (ruled illegal by 1968). NOW also led the fight for the ERA and pushed for Title IX. However, the legal changes had their own momentum: Title VII was actually added to the Civil Rights Act by a Southern congressman (Howard W. Smith) who hoped it would kill the bill, yet it passed anyway. Reed v. Reed (1971) set the precedent that the 14th Amendment applied to sex discrimination. Roe v. Wade (1973) was a court decision, not a campaign result. Title IX (1972) transformed education \u2014 female law school enrolment jumped from 4% to 26%. On balance, NOW and Friedan created the political pressure for change, but the legal victories gave women enforceable rights that campaign rhetoric alone could not. The two were inseparable: without NOW\u2019s pressure, many laws would not have been passed or enforced; without legal change, campaigning would have remained symbolic.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique (1963) inspired the movement, and NOW (1966) pressured the EEOC to take sex discrimination seriously, ending sex-segregated job adverts by 1968. NOW grew to over 40,000 members by the mid-1970s.\nExample (bullet 2): Title IX (1972) banned sex discrimination in education, dramatically increasing women\u2019s participation in university and sports. Reed v. Reed (1971) was the first Supreme Court ruling to strike down a law for sex discrimination.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: NOW pressured the EEOC to enforce Title VII and campaigned to end sex-segregated job adverts, which were ruled illegal by 1968.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Betty Friedan started the movement and NOW campaigned for women\u2019s rights.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        text: "Which of the following was a greater obstacle to the feminist movement:\n\n\u2022 Phyllis Schlafly and the STOP ERA campaign\n\u2022 continuing inequality in the workplace?\n\nExplain your answer with reference to both bullet points.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both obstacles limited the feminist movement in different ways. Schlafly\u2019s STOP ERA campaign (founded 1972) directly prevented the most important symbolic goal \u2014 a constitutional amendment guaranteeing equal rights. She mobilised conservative women who feared the ERA would force women into military combat, end separate toilets, and undermine traditional family roles. Her campaign halted ratification at 35 states, three short of the 38 needed, and five states even voted to rescind. This was devastating because without a constitutional amendment, women\u2019s rights depended on individual laws and court rulings that could be changed. However, workplace inequality was arguably more damaging to women\u2019s daily lives. Despite the Equal Pay Act (1963) and Title VII (1964), the pay gap actually widened slightly \u2014 women earned 57 cents per dollar by 1973, with Black women at 49 cents and Hispanic women at 45 cents. Only 5% of managers were women, and the \u2018glass ceiling\u2019 blocked advancement. Employers circumvented equal pay law by giving men and women different job titles. On balance, workplace inequality was the greater obstacle because it affected millions of women every day, while the ERA\u2019s failure, though symbolically important, may have made less practical difference given that specific laws like Title VII and Title IX already existed.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Schlafly\u2019s STOP ERA campaign mobilised conservative and religious women who feared losing protections. The ERA stalled at 35 states, three short of the 38 needed, and five states voted to rescind their ratification.\nExample (bullet 2): Despite the Equal Pay Act (1963), women in 1973 still earned only 57 cents per dollar. Employers got around the law by giving men and women slightly different job titles, and 95% of managers were still men.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Schlafly argued the ERA would force women into military combat and remove protections they already had, which frightened many women into opposing it.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Phyllis Schlafly stopped the ERA from passing.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."
