        <h2>The Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement</h2>

        <p>The civil rights movement inspired other groups to fight for their rights. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A broad social and political movement that emerged in the 1960s, campaigning for gender equality in areas including employment, pay, education, reproductive rights, and legal status. It built on the earlier suffrage movement and was sometimes called &lsquo;second-wave feminism.&rsquo;">women&rsquo;s liberation movement</dfn> &mdash; sometimes called &ldquo;second-wave feminism&rdquo; &mdash; became one of the most powerful social movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Women had won the right to <strong>vote</strong> in 1920 with the 19th Amendment, but they still faced deep inequality in employment, pay, education, and the law.</p>

        <h3>The Roots of Discontent</h3>

        <p>The seeds of the movement were planted during <strong>World War Two</strong>. Around <strong>6 million women</strong> worked in factories during the war, gaining independence and skills. But when the soldiers returned, most women were sacked and pushed back into domestic roles. This created a sense of frustration that would build for two decades.</p>

        <h3>The Problem with No Name</h3>

        <p>In <strong>1963</strong>, <dfn class="term" data-def="An American feminist writer and activist whose 1963 book The Feminine Mystique challenged the idea that women could find fulfilment solely through housework and motherhood. The book helped spark the women&rsquo;s liberation movement and Friedan went on to co-found the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966.">Betty Friedan</dfn> &mdash; a psychologist and journalist &mdash; published <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>. The book challenged the idea that women could only find fulfilment through being housewives and mothers. Friedan described the deep frustration felt by millions of educated, middle-class women trapped in domestic roles as &ldquo;the problem that has no name.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The book sold over <strong>3 million copies</strong>. It struck a chord with women across the country who felt unfulfilled but had been told they should be grateful for their comfortable lives. Friedan argued that society was wasting the talents of half its population by confining women to the home.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Women&rsquo;s Inequality in the 1960s</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Women earned only <strong>60 cents</strong> for every dollar earned by men doing the same job</li>
            <li>Many jobs were openly advertised as <strong>&ldquo;men only&rdquo;</strong> or &ldquo;women only,&rdquo; with higher-paid roles reserved for men</li>
            <li><strong>95%</strong> of managers were men</li>
            <li>Women could be <strong>legally sacked</strong> for getting pregnant &mdash; or even for <strong>getting married</strong>, in jobs like cabin crew and teaching</li>
            <li>Women struggled to get <strong>credit cards, mortgages, or bank loans</strong> without a male co-signer</li>
            <li>Only <strong>6%</strong> of doctors and <strong>3%</strong> of lawyers were women</li>
            <li>Many universities set <strong>quotas</strong> limiting female students</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>The Fight for Equal Pay</h2>

        <p>One of the central demands was <strong>equal pay for equal work</strong>. The pay gap was huge, and it was entirely legal for employers to pay women less simply because of their sex.</p>

        <h3>The Equal Pay Act (1963)</h3>

        <p>President Kennedy signed the <dfn class="term" data-def="A federal law passed in 1963 that required employers to pay men and women equally for performing the same work under similar conditions. It was the first federal law to address sex-based pay discrimination, though enforcement was weak and many loopholes remained.">Equal Pay Act</dfn> in June <strong>1963</strong>. It made it illegal to pay men and women different wages for the same work. This was the first federal law to tackle sex-based pay discrimination.</p>

        <p>However, the Act had <strong>serious limitations</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It only covered jobs that were <strong>exactly the same</strong> &mdash; employers got around it by giving men and women slightly different job titles</li>
          <li><strong>Enforcement was weak</strong> &mdash; the government lacked resources to investigate millions of employers</li>
          <li>It did not address the deeper problem: women were <strong>concentrated in low-paid jobs</strong> like teaching, nursing, and secretarial work, while better-paid professions stayed male-dominated</li>
          <li>By <strong>1973</strong>, women still earned only about <strong>57 cents</strong> for every dollar earned by men &mdash; the gap had actually <em>widened</em> slightly</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (1964)</h3>

        <p>A more powerful tool came with <strong>Title VII</strong> of the Civil Rights Act (1964), which banned employment discrimination based on <strong>sex</strong> as well as race. Ironically, a Southern congressman, <strong>Howard W. Smith</strong>, added the word &ldquo;sex&rdquo; hoping it would make the bill fail &mdash; but it passed anyway.</p>

        <p>Title VII created the <dfn class="term" data-def="The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency established by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to enforce laws against workplace discrimination based on race, colour, religion, sex, or national origin. Initially it had limited powers and was slow to take sex discrimination seriously, which frustrated feminist campaigners.">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</dfn> to handle discrimination complaints. But the EEOC did not take sex discrimination seriously at first &mdash; its director called the sex provision a &ldquo;fluke&rdquo; and the agency focused almost entirely on race. This failure to enforce the law was a key reason Betty Friedan and others formed a new organisation to fight for women&rsquo;s rights.</p>

        <h2>The National Organization for Women (NOW)</h2>

        <p>In <strong>1966</strong>, Betty Friedan and 27 others founded the <dfn class="term" data-def="The National Organization for Women, founded in 1966 by Betty Friedan and others, became the leading women&rsquo;s rights organisation in America. NOW campaigned for equal pay, equal opportunities in education and employment, reproductive rights, and the Equal Rights Amendment.">National Organization for Women (NOW)</dfn>. It became the largest and most influential feminist organisation in America. NOW was professional and well-organised, with around <strong>40,000 mainly middle-class members</strong> by the mid-1970s. It fought for change through the courts, lobbying Congress, and public campaigns.</p>

                <li>Pressured the EEOC to <strong>enforce Title VII</strong> on sex discrimination &mdash; filing lawsuits and protesting outside EEOC offices</li>
                <li>Campaigned to end <strong>sex-segregated job adverts</strong> (&ldquo;Help Wanted &mdash; Male&rdquo; / &ldquo;Female&rdquo;). By 1968, the EEOC ruled these were illegal</li>
                <li>Pushed for <strong>affordable childcare</strong> so mothers could work</li>
                <li>Campaigned for <strong>reproductive rights</strong>, including access to the <strong>contraceptive pill</strong> &mdash; which allowed women to plan when to have families &mdash; and abortion</li>
                <li>Led the fight for the <strong>Equal Rights Amendment</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>By <strong>1971</strong>, NOW had <strong>15,000 members</strong>, growing to over <strong>40,000</strong> by the mid-1970s. Its tactics were inspired by the civil rights movement: marches, court cases, and lobbying.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>The Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement &mdash; A More Radical Wing</h3>

        <p>Alongside NOW, a more radical wing emerged: the <strong>Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement</strong> (&ldquo;Women&rsquo;s Lib&rdquo;). These were mostly younger women who saw NOW as too cautious. They used confrontational tactics &mdash; burning bras, disrupting the <strong>Miss World</strong> pageant, and staging dramatic protests to grab media attention. While NOW worked through courts and Congress, Women&rsquo;s Lib aimed to shock society into change.</p>

        <h2>Gloria Steinem and <em>Ms.</em> Magazine</h2>

        <p>While Friedan was the movement&rsquo;s intellectual founder, <dfn class="term" data-def="An American journalist, feminist, and political activist who became one of the most recognisable leaders of the women&rsquo;s liberation movement. She co-founded Ms. magazine in 1972 and was a key spokesperson for feminist causes throughout the 1970s.">Gloria Steinem</dfn> became its most visible public face. She used her media skills to bring feminist ideas to a mass audience.</p>

        <p>In <strong>January 1972</strong>, Steinem co-founded <em>Ms.</em> magazine &mdash; the first mainstream magazine run by women, for women, with a <strong>feminist perspective</strong>. The preview issue sold all <strong>300,000 copies</strong> in eight days. <em>Ms.</em> covered domestic violence, sexual harassment, pay inequality, and reproductive rights &mdash; topics other magazines ignored. It proved there was a huge audience of women hungry for content that took their concerns seriously.</p>

        <p>Steinem also testified before Congress for the Equal Rights Amendment and co-founded the <strong>National Women&rsquo;s Political Caucus</strong> (1971), which worked to elect more women to office.</p>

        <h3>Reed v. Reed (1971)</h3>

        <p>In <strong>1971</strong>, the Supreme Court heard <dfn class="term" data-def="A landmark 1971 Supreme Court case in which the court unanimously ruled that an Idaho law automatically preferring men over women as estate administrators violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. It was the first time the Supreme Court struck down a law on the basis of sex discrimination.">Reed v. Reed</dfn>. Sally Reed challenged an Idaho law that automatically gave <strong>preference to men over women</strong> as estate administrators. The law stated: &ldquo;males must be preferred to females.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The Supreme Court ruled <strong>unanimously</strong> that this violated the <strong>Equal Protection Clause</strong> of the 14th Amendment. It was the <strong>first time</strong> the Court had struck down a law for sex discrimination. This opened the door to further legal challenges and was used as a precedent in many later cases.</p>

        <h3>Title IX (1972)</h3>

        <p><dfn class="term" data-def="A federal law passed in 1972 that banned sex discrimination in any educational programme or activity receiving federal funding. It dramatically increased opportunities for women in higher education and school sports, transforming women&rsquo;s participation in athletics.">Title IX</dfn> (1972) banned sex discrimination in any educational programme receiving federal funding. Its impact was dramatic:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Universities could no longer use <strong>quotas to limit female students</strong></li>
          <li>Schools had to offer <strong>equal sports opportunities</strong> &mdash; girls in high school sports rose from <strong>300,000 in 1972</strong> to over <strong>2 million by 1978</strong></li>
          <li>More women entered law, medicine, and business courses &mdash; female law school enrolment jumped from <strong>4%</strong> to <strong>26%</strong> in a decade</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Roe v. Wade (1973)</h3>

        <p>In January <strong>1973</strong>, the Supreme Court delivered one of the most controversial rulings in American history. In <dfn class="term" data-def="A landmark 1973 Supreme Court case that ruled women had a constitutional right to an abortion in the early stages of pregnancy, based on the right to privacy under the 14th Amendment. The decision was deeply controversial and remains one of the most debated rulings in American history.">Roe v. Wade</dfn>, the court ruled <strong>7&ndash;2</strong> that women had a constitutional right to <strong>abortion</strong> in early pregnancy, based on the right to privacy under the 14th Amendment.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Roe v. Wade</div>
          <p>The ruling set a framework based on the <strong>three trimesters</strong> of pregnancy:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>First trimester:</strong> The decision was left to the woman and her doctor</li>
            <li><strong>Second trimester:</strong> States could regulate abortion to protect the mother&rsquo;s health</li>
            <li><strong>Third trimester:</strong> States could ban abortion, as the foetus was viable (able to survive outside the womb)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Feminists celebrated this as a victory for women&rsquo;s control over their own bodies. Opponents &mdash; especially religious conservatives &mdash; condemned it. The ruling triggered a <strong>powerful anti-abortion movement</strong> that shaped American politics for decades.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Other Key Gains for Women</h2>

        <p>Two further changes transformed women&rsquo;s lives in this period:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>contraceptive pill</strong> &mdash; approved in 1960 and widely available by the late 1960s &mdash; gave women control over when to have children. This opened up career and education opportunities that had been almost impossible before</li>
          <li><strong>No-fault divorce laws</strong> &mdash; introduced by several states from 1969 &mdash; made it easier for women to leave unhappy marriages without having to prove their husband was at fault</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)</h2>

        <p>The most ambitious goal of the feminist movement was the <dfn class="term" data-def="A proposed amendment to the US Constitution that would have guaranteed equal legal rights regardless of sex. It stated: &lsquo;Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.&rsquo; First proposed in 1923, it passed Congress in 1972 but failed to be ratified by the required 38 states before its deadline in 1982.">Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)</dfn>. It would have added a simple statement to the Constitution: <em>&ldquo;Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.&rdquo;</em></p>

        <p>The ERA was first proposed in <strong>1923</strong>, shortly after women won the vote. It was reintroduced in every session of Congress for nearly 50 years before finally passing in <strong>March 1972</strong>. It then needed to be <dfn class="term" data-def="The process by which a proposed amendment to the Constitution is approved by the states. To become part of the Constitution, an amendment must be ratified by three-quarters (38) of the 50 states.">ratified</dfn> by <strong>38 of the 50 states</strong> to become part of the Constitution.</p>

        <p>At first, the ERA seemed certain to succeed. Within the first year, <strong>30 states</strong> ratified it. Then the process stalled dramatically.</p>

Schlafly was both a housewife <em>and</em> a qualified lawyer &mdash; and had once run for Congress herself and lost, which was ironic given her argument that women belonged in the home.

                <li><strong>Force women into military combat</strong> &mdash; a powerful argument during Vietnam, when the draft was deeply unpopular</li>
                <li><strong>End separate toilets and changing rooms</strong> for men and women</li>
                <li><strong>Remove protections</strong> women already had in divorce law, such as alimony and child custody</li>
                <li><strong>Undermine the traditional family</strong> by suggesting motherhood was not valued</li>
                <li>Lead to <strong>taxpayer-funded abortions</strong> and same-sex marriage</li>
              </ul>
              <p>She mobilised <strong>conservative women</strong>, many of them religious Christians, who felt feminism <em>attacked</em> their way of life. Her supporters baked bread and jams for state legislators with notes saying: <em>&ldquo;From the breadmakers to the breadwinners.&rdquo;</em></p>
              <p>The campaign was remarkably successful. The ERA <strong>stalled at 35 states</strong> &mdash; three short of the 38 needed. Despite a deadline extension to <strong>1982</strong>, no further states ratified it. Five states even voted to <strong>rescind</strong> (take back) their ratification.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why the ERA Failed</div>
          <p>The ERA&rsquo;s failure showed the <strong>limits of the feminist movement</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Schlafly&rsquo;s campaign <strong>frightened many women</strong> who feared losing protections they already had</li>
            <li>The movement was seen as representing <strong>educated, middle-class, white women</strong> &mdash; not working-class or minority women</li>
            <li>Opposition from <strong>religious conservatives</strong> in Southern and rural states proved impossible to overcome</li>
            <li>The broader <strong>conservative backlash</strong> of the late 1970s shifted the political mood to the right</li>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Legal victories:</strong> The Equal Pay Act, Title VII, Title IX, Reed v. Reed, and Roe v. Wade gave women far greater legal protection. Sex discrimination in employment and education was now illegal.</p>
              <p><strong>Changed attitudes:</strong> The idea that women should have the same opportunities as men became widely accepted, even if reality lagged behind.</p>
              <p><strong>Workforce:</strong> By 1973, over <strong>44%</strong> of women were in paid work, up from around 34% in 1950.</p>
              <p><strong>Education:</strong> Title IX opened universities and professional schools to women. Female enrolment surged.</p>
              <p><strong>Politics:</strong> The <strong>National Women&rsquo;s Political Caucus</strong> (1971) helped elect more women to office. Women&rsquo;s issues became a permanent part of political debate.</p>

              <p><strong>The pay gap persisted:</strong> Women in 1973 still earned only about <strong>57 cents</strong> for every dollar earned by men. Black women earned around <strong>49 cents</strong> and Hispanic women around <strong>45 cents</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>The ERA failed:</strong> Without a constitutional amendment, women&rsquo;s rights depended on individual laws and court rulings that could be changed or overturned.</p>
              <p><strong>Limited diversity:</strong> The movement was dominated by <strong>white, middle-class women</strong>. Working-class, Black, and Hispanic women often felt it did not represent them.</p>
              <p><strong>Conservative backlash:</strong> Schlafly&rsquo;s campaign showed that many women actively opposed feminism. The religious right became a major political force partly in response to feminist gains.</p>
              <p><strong>Workplace reality:</strong> Even where discrimination was illegal, women faced subtle barriers. They were passed over for promotion (the &ldquo;glass ceiling&rdquo;), faced sexual harassment, and were still expected to manage childcare and housework alongside paid work.</p>

        <p>The examiner wants a <strong>balanced assessment</strong>. Acknowledge the legal victories (Equal Pay Act, Title VII, Title IX, Roe v. Wade, Reed v. Reed) but explain why these <strong>did not fully solve</strong> gender inequality. Discuss the <strong>opposition</strong> &mdash; especially Schlafly and STOP ERA. Top marks go to answers that explain <strong>why</strong> the ERA failed and what this reveals about the limits of social change. Mention the two wings of the movement: NOW (professional, court cases) and Women&rsquo;s Lib (radical, confrontational).</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The feminist movement achieved real progress. Friedan&rsquo;s <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> and NOW sparked a national campaign for equality, while the more radical Women&rsquo;s Lib wing grabbed public attention. The Equal Pay Act, Title VII, Title IX, the contraceptive pill, and no-fault divorce laws all changed women&rsquo;s lives. The Supreme Court&rsquo;s rulings in Reed v. Reed and Roe v. Wade set important constitutional protections. Yet limits remained. The pay gap barely narrowed, <strong>95%</strong> of managers were still men, and Schlafly&rsquo;s campaign defeated the ERA. By 1973, the legal framework for equality was largely in place, but genuine equality in everyday life was still a distant goal.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Friedan&rsquo;s <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> (1963)</strong> and <strong>NOW (1966)</strong> launched the movement. NOW fought through courts and lobbying; the Women&rsquo;s Lib wing used radical protest.</li>
          <li><strong>Reed v. Reed (1971)</strong> was the first Supreme Court ruling to strike down a law for sex discrimination, using the 14th Amendment.</li>
          <li><strong>Roe v. Wade (1973)</strong> gave women a right to abortion but triggered a powerful conservative backlash that shaped politics for decades.</li>
        </ul>
