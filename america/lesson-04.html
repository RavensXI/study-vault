        <h2>What Was the Wall Street Crash?</h2>

        <p>The <strong>Wall Street Crash</strong> of October 1929 was the sudden, catastrophic collapse of share prices on the <strong>New York Stock Exchange</strong> (located on Wall Street in New York City). In a matter of days, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of American companies, ruining millions of investors and triggering the worst economic depression in modern history.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Scale of the Crash</div>
          <p>Between September and November 1929, the total value of shares on the New York Stock Exchange fell from <strong>$87 billion to $30 billion</strong> &mdash; a loss of over <strong>$57 billion</strong>. By 1932, shares were worth only <strong>20%</strong> of their pre-crash value. An estimated <strong>$30 billion</strong> was lost in the first week of panic alone.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Long-Term Causes of the Crash</h2>

        <p>The Crash did not happen overnight. Several underlying weaknesses in the American economy had been building throughout the 1920s:</p>

        <h3>Speculation</h3>
        <p>During the 1920s, millions of ordinary Americans had been buying shares in the stock market, hoping to make quick profits as prices rose. This was called <strong>speculation</strong>. By 1929, around <strong>1.5 million Americans</strong> owned shares. Many were not experienced investors &mdash; they were ordinary people caught up in the excitement of a rising market.</p>

        <p>Worse still, many people bought shares <strong>&lsquo;on the margin&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; they borrowed money from banks to invest, paying only <strong>10%</strong> of the share price upfront and borrowing the rest. This worked well as long as prices kept rising, but if prices fell, investors would owe far more than their shares were worth.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Buying on the Margin</div>
          <p>By 1929, <strong>$8.5 billion</strong> had been loaned out for share purchases &mdash; more than the entire amount of money in circulation in the USA at the time. The stock market had become a giant bubble, inflated by borrowed money and blind optimism.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Overproduction</h3>
        <p>American factories were producing far more goods than people could afford to buy. New mass production techniques meant goods were being churned out at record rates, but <strong>wages had not risen fast enough</strong> for most workers to keep up with supply. By the late 1920s, warehouses were filling up with unsold goods &mdash; cars, fridges, radios, and clothing that nobody was buying. When businesses could not sell their products, they cut production and laid off workers, reducing spending power even further.</p>

        <h3>Unequal Distribution of Wealth</h3>
        <p>The prosperity of the 1920s was shared very unevenly. The richest <strong>5%</strong> of Americans received approximately <strong>33%</strong> of all national income. Meanwhile, around <strong>60%</strong> of American families earned less than <strong>$2,000 per year</strong> &mdash; the minimum needed for a decent standard of living. With so many people too poor to buy consumer goods, the market for new products was limited, and overproduction was inevitable.</p>

        <h3>Weak Banking System</h3>
        <p>The American banking system was fragile. There were thousands of small, independent banks across the country, many of which had made risky loans to speculators and farmers. There was no federal deposit insurance, so if a bank failed, its customers lost all their savings. The banking system was a house of cards waiting to collapse.</p>

        <h3>Agricultural Problems</h3>
        <p>Farmers had been struggling throughout the 1920s. Overproduction had driven down crop prices, and many farmers were deep in debt. When farmers could not repay their loans, rural banks began to fail. This weakness in the agricultural sector spread to the wider economy.</p>

        <h3>International Trade Problems</h3>
        <p>American tariffs (like the <strong>Fordney-McCumber Tariff</strong> of 1922) had made foreign goods expensive, but other countries retaliated by putting tariffs on American exports. This reduced overseas markets for American goods, contributing to overproduction at home. European economies were also weak, reducing demand for American products.</p>

        <h2>The Events of October 1929</h2>

        <p>Confidence in the stock market began to waver in September 1929 as some experienced investors started selling their shares, sensing that prices had risen too high. The situation then deteriorated rapidly:</p>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Thursday 24 October &mdash; &lsquo;Black Thursday&rsquo;:</strong> Panic selling began. Nearly <strong>13 million shares</strong> were traded in a single day as investors rushed to sell. A group of leading bankers pooled their money to buy shares and briefly stabilised prices, but confidence had been shattered.</p>
              <p><strong>Monday 28 October &mdash; &lsquo;Black Monday&rsquo;:</strong> Selling resumed with even greater intensity. Share prices plummeted, and the bankers&rsquo; rescue effort failed. The market lost <strong>13%</strong> of its value in a single day.</p>
              <p><strong>Tuesday 29 October &mdash; &lsquo;Black Tuesday&rsquo;:</strong> The worst day of the crash. Over <strong>16 million shares</strong> were sold in a frenzy of panic. Prices collapsed completely. Investors who had bought on the margin were ruined &mdash; they owed more than their shares were now worth. Fortunes were wiped out in hours.</p>
              <p><strong>The weeks that followed:</strong> Prices continued to fall through November. By mid-November, the market had lost roughly <strong>$30 billion</strong> in value. There was no recovery &mdash; prices would continue falling until 1932.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Immediate Consequences</h2>

        <p>The crash had devastating and far-reaching effects:</p>

        <h3>Investors Ruined</h3>
        <p>Millions of people who had invested their savings in the stock market lost everything. Those who had bought on the margin were left with enormous debts. Some wealthy investors were reduced to poverty overnight. There were reports of ruined businessmen and speculators taking their own lives.</p>

        <h3>Banks Collapsed</h3>
        <p>Banks had lent huge sums to investors who could now not repay. As loans turned bad, banks began to fail. By 1929&ndash;1932, over <strong>5,000 banks</strong> collapsed. When a bank failed, ordinary people who had deposited their savings lost everything &mdash; there was no government insurance to protect them. This caused further panic as people rushed to withdraw their money from surviving banks, causing even more to fail.</p>

        <h3>Businesses Failed</h3>
        <p>With banks collapsing and credit drying up, businesses could not get loans to operate. Consumer spending plummeted as people lost their savings and their confidence. Factories cut production, shops closed, and companies went bankrupt. By 1933, industrial production had fallen by nearly <strong>50%</strong> from its 1929 level.</p>

        <h3>Unemployment Soared</h3>
        <p>As businesses failed, millions of workers lost their jobs. Unemployment rose from around <strong>1.5 million</strong> in 1929 to over <strong>13 million</strong> by 1933 &mdash; roughly <strong>25%</strong> of the workforce. With no welfare system to support them, unemployed workers and their families faced destitution.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; A Vicious Cycle</div>
          <p>The crash created a devastating <strong>downward spiral</strong>: share prices fell, so investors lost money. Banks failed, so people lost savings. Businesses closed, so workers lost jobs. Unemployed workers could not buy goods, so more businesses closed, creating more unemployment. This vicious cycle plunged America into the <strong>Great Depression</strong>.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When explaining the causes of the Wall Street Crash, remember to distinguish between <strong>long-term causes</strong> (overproduction, speculation, unequal wealth, weak banks) and <strong>short-term triggers</strong> (the panic selling of October 1929). The best answers will show how the long-term weaknesses made the crash <strong>inevitable</strong>, and how the events of October 1929 simply exposed problems that already existed. Always link causes together &mdash; for example, explain how overproduction led to falling profits, which caused share prices to fall, which triggered panic selling.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Wall Street Crash of 1929 was not simply a stock market event &mdash; it was the moment when the hidden weaknesses of the 1920s boom were brutally exposed. Years of speculation, overproduction, unequal wealth, and a fragile banking system had created an economy built on borrowed money and false confidence. When panic selling began in October 1929, the entire structure collapsed, dragging millions of Americans into poverty and launching the worst economic depression in modern history.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Deeper causes:</strong> The crash was caused by long-term weaknesses &mdash; speculation, overproduction, unequal wealth, and weak banking &mdash; not just the panic of October 1929.</li>
          <li><strong>Black Tuesday (29 October 1929)</strong> saw over 16 million shares sold in panic. Share values fell from $87 billion to $30 billion in weeks.</li>
          <li><strong>Devastating consequences:</strong> Over 5,000 banks failed, unemployment reached 25%, and the crash triggered the Great Depression that would last throughout the 1930s.</li>
