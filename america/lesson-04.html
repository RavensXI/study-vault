        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Introduction: A Nation of Divisions</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The &lsquo;Roaring Twenties&rsquo; hid deep divisions. While some enjoyed new wealth and freedoms, millions faced <strong>racism, prejudice, and poverty</strong>. Around <strong>60%</strong> of American families lived below the <dfn class="term" data-def="The minimum level of income needed for a basic standard of living, including food, shelter, and clothing.">poverty line</dfn> &mdash; even during the boom. Tensions between old and new, native-born and immigrant, white and Black, rich and poor ran through every part of society.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">This lesson covers <strong>economic inequality</strong>, the causes of <strong>racial tension</strong>, the experiences of <strong>immigrants</strong>, the revival of the <strong>Ku Klux Klan</strong>, and the <strong>Red Scare</strong> &mdash; including the case of <strong>Sacco and Vanzetti</strong>.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">Economic Inequality Beneath the Boom</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">Not everyone shared in 1920s prosperity. The boom was largely an <strong>urban, industrial</strong> success story. Millions in rural America and in older industries were left behind.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n6">Farmers in Crisis</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n7">American farmers had expanded production during World War One to feed Europe. After the war, demand dropped and prices collapsed. Around <strong>6 million farmers</strong> were forced off their land during the 1920s. <dfn class="term" data-def="The use of machines (such as combine harvesters and tractors) to replace human labour in agriculture and industry.">Mechanisation</dfn> &mdash; especially <strong>combine harvesters</strong> and tractors &mdash; replaced manual labour, cutting the number of jobs available in farming.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n8">Declining Industries</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n9">Workers in older industries also suffered. <strong>Coal miners</strong> faced low wages and dangerous conditions as oil and electricity replaced coal. Textile workers in New England saw jobs move south, where wages were lower. These workers had no share in the consumer boom happening in cities.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n10">The Rural&ndash;Urban Divide</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n11">A deep cultural divide separated <strong>rural and urban America</strong>. Cities were centres of jazz, cinema, new fashions, and liberal attitudes. Rural America &mdash; especially in the South and Midwest &mdash; was more <strong>traditionalist, religious, and conservative</strong>. Many rural Americans saw city life as immoral and un-American. This clash fuelled support for <strong>Prohibition</strong>, hostility to immigration, and the revival of the <strong>KKK</strong>.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n12" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Poverty in the Boom</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n13">Around <strong>60%</strong> of American families earned less than <strong>$2,000 per year</strong> &mdash; the minimum needed for a decent standard of living. About <strong>6 million farmers</strong> lost their land. The boom mainly benefited white, urban, middle-class Americans, not the majority of the population.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n14">The Causes of Racial Tension</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">Racial tension in 1920s America had deep roots. The country had a long history of <dfn class="term" data-def="The treatment of a person or group differently and unfairly based on characteristics such as race, religion, or national origin.">discrimination</dfn> against non-white groups, and the 1920s saw these tensions grow worse.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n16">The Great Migration</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n17">During and after <strong>World War One</strong>, hundreds of thousands of <strong>African Americans</strong> moved from the rural South to northern cities. This movement was called the <dfn class="term" data-def="The large-scale movement of African Americans from the rural South to the cities of the North, Midwest, and West, beginning around 1916 and continuing through the 1970s.">Great Migration</dfn>. They were escaping <strong>sharecropping</strong> poverty, <strong>lynching</strong> violence, and the humiliation of <dfn class="term" data-def="State and local laws in the American South that enforced racial segregation and discrimination against African Americans from the late 1870s until the 1960s.">Jim Crow laws</dfn>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n18">By <strong>1920</strong>, there were around <strong>11 million</strong> Black Americans living in the USA. In cities like <strong>Chicago, Detroit, and New York</strong>, African Americans hoped for better factory jobs. They still faced serious discrimination &mdash; given the <strong>lowest-paid and most dangerous jobs</strong>, forced into overcrowded <dfn class="term" data-def="A section of a city, especially a run-down area, occupied by a minority group who live there because of social or economic pressure.">ghettos</dfn>, and resented by white workers who saw them as competition.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n19" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Great Migration</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n20">Between <strong>1916 and 1930</strong>, about <strong>1.5 million</strong> African Americans left the South for northern cities. They still faced prejudice. In <strong>1919</strong>, race riots broke out in over <strong>25 cities</strong> during the &lsquo;Red Summer.&rsquo; The worst was in <strong>Chicago</strong>, where <strong>38 people</strong> were killed.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n21">Jim Crow and Segregation</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n22">In the <strong>Southern states</strong>, African Americans lived under <strong>Jim Crow laws</strong> &mdash; legal racial segregation. These laws kept Black and white people apart in schools, restaurants, buses, parks, and hospitals. Black people were denied the vote through <strong>literacy tests</strong>, <strong>poll taxes</strong>, and the <strong>&lsquo;grandfather clause&rsquo;</strong> (you could only vote if your grandfather had voted &mdash; impossible for descendants of enslaved people).</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">Segregation was backed up by <strong>violence</strong>. <dfn class="term" data-def="The killing of a person by a mob, often by hanging, without a legal trial.">Lynching</dfn> &mdash; the murder of Black people by white mobs &mdash; was common. Between <strong>1882 and 1968</strong>, nearly <strong>5,000 lynchings</strong> were recorded, mostly of African Americans in the South. The federal government repeatedly failed to pass anti-lynching laws.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n24">Immigration and Its Impact</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n25">The USA had long been a nation of immigrants. By the 1920s, attitudes had turned sharply against newcomers &mdash; especially those from <strong>Southern and Eastern Europe</strong>.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n26">Who Were the Immigrants?</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n27">Between <strong>1850 and 1914</strong>, around <strong>40 million people</strong> emigrated to the USA. The earliest settlers &mdash; the &lsquo;old immigrants&rsquo; &mdash; came mainly from <strong>Britain, Germany, Holland</strong>, and <strong>Scandinavia</strong>. Their descendants held the best jobs, the most wealth, and most political power. They were the <dfn class="term" data-def="White Anglo-Saxon Protestant &mdash; a term used to describe Americans of English Protestant descent who historically dominated American political, economic, and social life.">WASPs</dfn> (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants). America was described as a <dfn class="term" data-def="The idea that immigrants from many different backgrounds would blend together and lose their old identities to become &lsquo;Americans.&rsquo;">&lsquo;melting pot&rsquo;</dfn> &mdash; the idea being that all races would mix together and become one nation.</p>
        <p data-narration-id="n28">From the late nineteenth century, &lsquo;new immigrants&rsquo; arrived from <strong>Italy, Poland, Russia, Greece</strong>, and the <strong>Austro-Hungarian Empire</strong>. Many were <strong>Catholic or Jewish</strong>, spoke little English, and had very different cultures from the WASPs. A smaller number of <strong>Hispanics and Asians</strong> also arrived. These new immigrants settled in cities, living in ethnic neighbourhoods and working in factories, mines, and construction.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n29">Why Did Attitudes Harden?</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n30">Hostility towards immigrants grew for several reasons:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n75">
          <li><strong>Competition for jobs:</strong> Native-born Americans resented immigrants who worked for lower wages.</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural fears:</strong> Immigrants brought different languages, religions, and customs. Many WASPs feared America&rsquo;s identity was being diluted.</li>
          <li><strong>The Red Scare:</strong> After the <strong>Russian Revolution of 1917</strong>, many feared immigrants from Eastern Europe were bringing <dfn class="term" data-def="A political and economic system in which the state owns the means of production and aims to create a classless society.">communist</dfn> and <dfn class="term" data-def="A political philosophy that advocates for the abolition of all government and the organisation of society on a voluntary, cooperative basis.">anarchist</dfn> ideas.</li>
          <li><strong>Racism:</strong> Pseudo-scientific ideas about racial superiority were widespread. Many Americans saw Southern and Eastern Europeans as racially inferior.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n31">Immigration Restriction</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n32">Growing hostility led to new laws that slashed immigration:</p>

            <div class="timeline-date">1917</div>
            <h4>Immigration Act</h4>
            <p data-narration-id="n34">Introduced a <strong>literacy test</strong> &mdash; immigrants had to prove they could read and write. This targeted poorer immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe.</p>

            <h4>Emergency Quota Act</h4>
            <p data-narration-id="n35">Set a maximum of <strong>375,000</strong> immigrants per year. Each country was limited to <strong>3%</strong> of the number from that country already in the USA (based on the 1910 census). This was the first numerical cap on immigration.</p>

            <p data-narration-id="n36">Tightened quotas to <strong>2%</strong> of each nationality, now based on the <strong>1890 census</strong> &mdash; before the surge of Southern and Eastern European immigration. This deliberately favoured <strong>Northern and Western Europeans</strong> and blocked Italians, Poles, Russians, and Greeks.</p>

          <div class="timeline-event">
            <div class="timeline-date">1929</div>

            <p data-narration-id="n37">Total immigration was capped at just <strong>150,000</strong> per year. Immigration from <strong>Asia was banned entirely</strong>. This completed a decade of increasingly restrictive controls.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n39">The Ku Klux Klan</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n40">The <strong>Ku Klux Klan (KKK)</strong> was a white <dfn class="term" data-def="The belief that white people are superior to other races and should dominate society.">supremacist</dfn> group that first appeared after the <strong>Civil War</strong> in the 1860s. It was revived in <strong>1915</strong> and grew rapidly during the 1920s.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n41">The Revival of the Klan</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n42">The KKK was re-founded in <strong>1915</strong> by <strong>William J. Simmons</strong> at Stone Mountain, Georgia, inspired by the hit film <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> (1915). The new Klan kept the old symbols &mdash; <strong>white robes, hoods, burning crosses</strong> &mdash; but expanded its targets to include <strong>Catholics, Jews, immigrants, and anyone seen as &lsquo;un-American.&rsquo;</strong></p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n43">Growth and Membership</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n44">Under <strong>Hiram Wesley Evans</strong>, who became <dfn class="term" data-def="The title used by the leader of the Ku Klux Klan, meaning &lsquo;Imperial Wizard.&rsquo;">Imperial Wizard</dfn> in 1922, the Klan grew fast. It used professional recruiters called <strong>&lsquo;Kleagles&rsquo;</strong> and charged <strong>$10</strong> to join (a large sum then), with the recruiter keeping $4. Its message of white, Protestant, native-born supremacy appealed to those who felt threatened by change.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n45" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; KKK Membership</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n46">At its peak, the Klan had <strong>4&ndash;5 million members</strong>. It was not just a Southern movement &mdash; states like <strong>Indiana, Ohio, Oregon</strong>, and <strong>Oklahoma</strong> had huge memberships. In <strong>Indiana</strong>, about <strong>30%</strong> of all white men were members. Klan-backed candidates won governorships and seats in Congress.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n47">Klan Methods and Violence</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n48">The KKK used <strong>intimidation, beatings, tarring and feathering, arson</strong>, and <strong>murder</strong>. It boycotted Black-owned and Jewish-owned businesses. In <strong>1925</strong>, <strong>40,000 Klansmen</strong> marched down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. The Klan claimed to defend traditional American values and the Protestant faith.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n49">The Klan collapsed in the late 1920s, mainly because of the <strong>D.C. Stephenson scandal</strong>. Stephenson, the Grand Dragon of the Indiana Klan, was convicted in <strong>1925</strong> of the <strong>kidnap, rape, and murder</strong> of <strong>Madge Oberholtzer</strong>. This exposed the Klan&rsquo;s hypocrisy.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n50">From prison, Stephenson named politicians who had taken Klan bribes. Several were jailed. Membership fell from millions to about <strong>30,000 by 1930</strong>. The Klan did not vanish entirely &mdash; it resurfaced during the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s&ndash;60s.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n51">The Red Scare</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n52">After <strong>World War One</strong> and the <strong>Russian Revolution of 1917</strong>, fear swept across America. Many were terrified that <strong>communists</strong> and <strong>anarchists</strong> were plotting to overthrow the government. This panic became the <dfn class="term" data-def="A period of widespread fear of communism, anarchism, and radical left-wing movements in the United States, particularly intense in 1919&ndash;1920.">Red Scare</dfn>.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n53">Why Were Americans Afraid?</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n54">Key events fuelled the panic:</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n76">
          <li>The <strong>Russian Revolution (1917)</strong> overthrew the Russian government and set up a communist state. Many feared the same in America.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1919</strong>, a wave of <strong>strikes</strong> hit the USA, including a <strong>general strike in Seattle</strong> and a <strong>police strike in Boston</strong>. Many Americans blamed communists.</li>
          <li>In <strong>April and June 1919</strong>, <strong>anarchists sent bombs</strong> to politicians and businessmen, including <strong>Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer</strong>. One bomb damaged his home.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n55">The Palmer Raids</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n56">Attorney General <strong>Palmer</strong> launched raids against suspected radicals. Between <strong>November 1919 and January 1920</strong>, his agents arrested over <strong>6,000 people</strong>. Many were held without charge and denied lawyers. Around <strong>500 foreign-born suspects</strong> were <dfn class="term" data-def="The official removal of a foreign national from a country, usually back to their country of origin.">deported</dfn>, including anarchist <strong>Emma Goldman</strong>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n57">The raids were popular at first, but support faded when Palmer clearly exaggerated the threat. His prediction of a <strong>communist revolution on 1 May 1920</strong> never happened, and he was ridiculed. The Red Scare calmed down, but suspicion of immigrants and radicals lasted throughout the decade.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n58">The Sacco and Vanzetti Case</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n59">The most famous example of how the Red Scare and anti-immigrant prejudice combined was the case of <strong>Nicola Sacco</strong> and <strong>Bartolomeo Vanzetti</strong>.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n60">The Crime</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n61">In <strong>April 1920</strong>, paymaster <strong>Fred Parmenter</strong> and an armed guard were shot dead during a robbery at a <strong>shoe factory in South Braintree, Massachusetts</strong>. About <strong>$15,000</strong> was stolen. Before he died, Parmenter described his attackers as &ldquo;slim foreigners with olive skins.&rdquo; Three weeks later, <strong>Sacco</strong> (a shoe-maker) and <strong>Vanzetti</strong> (a fish-seller) were arrested. Both were <strong>Italian immigrants</strong> and <strong>anarchists</strong> who had dodged the military draft.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n62">The Trial</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n63">Their <strong>1921</strong> trial was deeply controversial. The evidence was weak. The judge, <strong>Webster Thayer</strong>, was openly hostile &mdash; he reportedly called them &ldquo;those anarchist bastards&rdquo; outside court. Both were found <strong>guilty of murder</strong> and sentenced to death.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n64">Many believed they were convicted for being <strong>Italian, immigrant, and anarchist</strong> &mdash; not because of the evidence. The case became a <strong>worldwide cause</strong>, with protests across Europe and South America.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n65">Over six years, their lawyers launched appeals. A convicted criminal named <strong>Celestino Madeiros</strong> confessed to the robbery and said Sacco and Vanzetti were innocent. All appeals were rejected &mdash; several by the same <strong>Judge Thayer</strong>.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n66">A special committee reviewed the case in <strong>1927</strong> but upheld the verdict. On <strong>23 August 1927</strong>, Sacco and Vanzetti were <strong>executed by electric chair</strong>. Their deaths sparked worldwide protests. In <strong>1977</strong>, the Governor of Massachusetts declared the trial unfair.</p>

        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n67">The Significance of the Case</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n68">The case exposed <strong>deep prejudice</strong> against immigrants and radicals. It showed how the <strong>Red Scare</strong> and <strong>anti-immigrant feeling</strong> could corrupt the justice system. It became a symbol of the intolerance beneath the surface of the &lsquo;Roaring Twenties.&rsquo;</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n70">Questions often ask you to explain causes of tension or evaluate how far America was &lsquo;divided.&rsquo; Cover <strong>multiple groups</strong> (African Americans, immigrants, radicals, the poor) and <strong>link causes together</strong>. The Red Scare fuelled anti-immigrant prejudice, which shaped the Sacco and Vanzetti trial. The rural&ndash;urban divide fuelled Klan support. Always use <strong>specific evidence</strong> &mdash; names, dates, statistics, and laws.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div data-narration-id="n71" class="conclusion">
        <h2 data-narration-id="n72">Conclusion</h2>
        <p data-narration-id="n73">The 1920s were deeply divided. Around 60% of families lived below the poverty line, 6 million farmers lost their land, and rural America clashed culturally with the cities. African Americans faced racism and violence North and South. Immigrants were shut out by quota laws. The KKK had millions of members. Sacco and Vanzetti&rsquo;s execution showed how fear and prejudice could corrupt justice. The &lsquo;Roaring Twenties&rsquo; was no golden age for most Americans.</p>
        <h3 data-narration-id="n74">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n77">
          <li><strong>Economic division:</strong> 60% of families lived below the poverty line. 6 million farmers were forced off their land by falling prices and mechanisation.</li>
          <li><strong>Racial tension and the KKK:</strong> The Great Migration, Jim Crow, and the KKK (4&ndash;5 million members) showed that racism shaped every part of American life.</li>
          <li><strong>Immigration restriction:</strong> The 1921 and 1924 quota laws cut immigration from 800,000 to 150,000 a year, deliberately targeting Southern and Eastern Europeans.</li>

After the Russian Revolution of 1917, many Americans feared immigrants from Eastern Europe were bringing communist and anarchist ideas. Attorney General Palmer\u2019s raids arrested over 6,000 suspected radicals, and around 500 foreign-born suspects were deported.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: African Americans faced discrimination that varied by region but was severe everywhere. In the South, Jim Crow laws enforced rigid segregation in schools, restaurants, buses, and hospitals. Black people were denied the vote through literacy tests, poll taxes, and the grandfather clause. Lynching was widespread \u2014 nearly 5,000 were recorded between 1882 and 1968. During the Great Migration (1916\u20131930), about 1.5 million African Americans moved north, hoping for better factory jobs. They still faced discrimination \u2014 forced into the lowest-paid and most dangerous jobs, confined to overcrowded ghettos, and resented by white workers. In 1919, race riots broke out in over 25 cities during the \u2018Red Summer,\u2019 with 38 killed in Chicago alone. The KKK, with 4\u20135 million members at its peak, targeted African Americans through intimidation, beatings, and murder. Yet culturally, the Harlem Renaissance saw Black artists and writers like Langston Hughes build a sense of pride and identity \u2014 even as legal and social equality remained distant.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: In the South, Jim Crow laws meant segregation in all public places. Black people were denied the vote through poll taxes and literacy tests. In northern cities, African Americans who migrated during the Great Migration still faced discrimination \u2014 they were given the worst jobs and forced into overcrowded ghettos.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: The KKK terrorised African Americans. At its peak, the Klan had 4\u20135 million members and used intimidation, beatings, and murder.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: African Americans faced racism and segregation in the 1920s.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: The Red Scare affected different groups of Americans in different ways. For immigrants, especially those from Eastern Europe, it brought fear and persecution. Attorney General Palmer launched raids between November 1919 and January 1920, arresting over 6,000 suspected radicals. Many were held without charge and denied lawyers. Around 500 foreign-born suspects were deported, including anarchist Emma Goldman. The most lasting impact was on attitudes towards immigrants \u2014 suspicion of \u2018un-American\u2019 ideas fuelled the quota laws of 1921 and 1924 that slashed immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. The Sacco and Vanzetti case became the most famous symbol: two Italian anarchists were convicted of murder in 1921 on weak evidence, with Judge Webster Thayer openly hostile, and executed in 1927 despite worldwide protests. For most native-born Americans, the Red Scare faded after Palmer\u2019s predicted communist revolution on 1 May 1920 never happened, but the underlying suspicion of immigrants and radicals lasted throughout the decade.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: The Palmer Raids arrested over 6,000 people suspected of being communists or anarchists. Around 500 were deported. The Red Scare also affected the Sacco and Vanzetti trial \u2014 they were Italian immigrant anarchists convicted on weak evidence, and many believed they were convicted for their background rather than the crime.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: The Palmer Raids arrested thousands of suspected radicals. Many were held without charge and about 500 were deported from America.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Americans were afraid of communism after the Russian Revolution.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both issues exposed deep divisions in American society, but in different ways. Prohibition (1920\u20131933) affected every American. The 18th Amendment banned the manufacture, sale, and transport of alcohol, but it proved impossible to enforce with only 1,500 agents. By 1929, New York had 32,000 speakeasies. Prohibition fuelled organised crime \u2014 Al Capone\u2019s empire earned $100 million a year \u2014 and corrupted law enforcement. An estimated 10,000 people died from poisonous moonshine. It showed the clash between moral reformers (often rural Protestants) and urban Americans who rejected the ban. Immigration was also a source of major tension. Between 1850 and 1914, 40 million people emigrated to America, but by the 1920s hostility towards \u2018new immigrants\u2019 from Southern and Eastern Europe had grown. The Red Scare linked immigrants to communism and anarchism. Quota laws (1921 and 1924) deliberately cut immigration from these regions, and by 1929 total immigration was capped at 150,000. The Sacco and Vanzetti case showed how prejudice corrupted justice. Both issues revealed the same fundamental divide: between modern, urban, tolerant America and traditional, rural, nativist America. Prohibition arguably had a wider immediate impact because it affected everyone\u2019s daily life, but immigration restrictions had longer-lasting consequences for America\u2019s demographic future.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Prohibition had a huge impact. It led to the rise of organised crime \u2014 Al Capone earned $100 million a year \u2014 and mass law-breaking. New York had 32,000 speakeasies by 1929, showing how widely the law was ignored.\nExample (bullet 2): Immigration was a divisive issue. Quota laws in 1921 and 1924 slashed immigration, and the Sacco and Vanzetti trial showed how fear and prejudice against immigrants could corrupt the justice system.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Prohibition led to organised crime and speakeasies. Al Capone became very powerful in Chicago.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Both prohibition and immigration caused problems in the 1920s.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both demonstrated the climate of fear and intolerance in 1920s America, but affected different groups. The KKK was revived in 1915 and grew to 4\u20135 million members by the mid-1920s, targeting not just African Americans but also Catholics, Jews, and immigrants. In Indiana, about 30% of white men were members. Klan-backed candidates won governorships and congressional seats, and 40,000 Klansmen marched in Washington, D.C. in 1925. The Klan used intimidation, beatings, arson, and murder to enforce white Protestant supremacy. Its collapse came through the D.C. Stephenson scandal (1925), when the Indiana Grand Dragon was convicted of kidnap, rape, and murder, exposing the Klan\u2019s hypocrisy. The Red Scare and Palmer Raids had a more concentrated impact in 1919\u20131920. Palmer arrested over 6,000 suspected radicals, deporting 500. The Sacco and Vanzetti case (1920\u20131927) became an international cause, with many believing the two Italian anarchists were convicted because of prejudice, not evidence. The Red Scare faded when Palmer\u2019s predicted revolution never happened, but it fuelled lasting suspicion of immigrants. The KKK arguably had the greater long-term impact because it had millions of members, wielded political power, and terrorised communities over several years, while the Palmer Raids were intense but short-lived.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets.
