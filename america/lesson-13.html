        <h2>America and the &lsquo;Great Society&rsquo;</h2>

        <p>In the early 1960s, the United States was the richest country in the world &mdash; yet millions of Americans still lived in poverty. Presidents <strong>John F. Kennedy</strong> (1961&ndash;1963) and <strong>Lyndon B. Johnson</strong> (1963&ndash;1969) both believed the federal government should tackle poverty, improve education, and expand healthcare. Their programmes &mdash; Kennedy&rsquo;s <dfn class="term" data-def="The name given to President Kennedy&rsquo;s domestic programme of social reforms, announced in 1960.">New Frontier</dfn> and Johnson&rsquo;s <dfn class="term" data-def="President Johnson&rsquo;s ambitious programme of domestic reforms, announced in 1964.">Great Society</dfn> &mdash; were the biggest expansion of government social policy since Roosevelt&rsquo;s New Deal in the 1930s.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Scale of Poverty in 1960s America</div>
          <p>When Kennedy took office in <strong>January 1961</strong>, around <strong>40 million Americans</strong> &mdash; roughly <strong>22%</strong> of the population &mdash; lived below the poverty line. Poverty hit <strong>African Americans</strong>, <strong>the elderly</strong>, and <strong>rural communities</strong> in Appalachia and the Deep South hardest. Michael Harrington&rsquo;s book <em>The Other America</em> (1962) shocked the nation by exposing the &ldquo;invisible poor&rdquo; hidden behind suburban prosperity.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Kennedy&rsquo;s New Frontier (1961&ndash;1963)</h2>

        <p><strong>John F. Kennedy</strong> won the 1960 election by a razor-thin margin against <strong>Richard Nixon</strong>. At the Democratic convention, he spoke of a &ldquo;New Frontier&rdquo; &mdash; promising bold action on poverty, education, healthcare, and civil rights. He was young, charismatic, and inspired hope for a more equal America.</p>

        <h3>What Did Kennedy Propose?</h3>

        <p>Kennedy&rsquo;s New Frontier included proposals for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Federal health insurance for the elderly (which would later become <dfn class="term" data-def="A federal health insurance programme for Americans aged 65 and over, signed into law by President Johnson in July 1965.">Medicare</dfn>)</li>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> Federal funding for schools, teacher training, and university scholarships</li>
          <li><strong>Poverty:</strong> A higher minimum wage and investment in depressed areas</li>
          <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Slum clearance and urban renewal</li>
          <li><strong>Civil rights:</strong> Laws to end racial discrimination</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Did Kennedy Actually Achieve?</h3>

        <p>Kennedy faced serious opposition in Congress. Many <strong>Southern Democrats</strong> were deeply conservative and opposed social reform &mdash; especially anything linked to civil rights. They teamed up with <strong>Republicans</strong> to block much of Kennedy&rsquo;s programme.</p>

        <p>Despite this, Kennedy did achieve some important reforms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>minimum wage</strong> was raised from <strong>$1.00 to $1.25</strong> per hour in 1961</li>
          <li>The <strong>Area Redevelopment Act</strong> (1961) gave loans and grants to economically depressed areas</li>
          <li>The <strong>Manpower Development and Training Act</strong> (1962) funded retraining for workers who had lost jobs to new technology</li>
          <li>The <strong>Housing Act</strong> (1961) provided <strong>$4.9 billion</strong> for urban renewal &mdash; though housing loans mostly helped existing homeowners, not the poorest families</li>
          <li><strong>Social Security</strong> benefits were extended and the minimum payment was increased</li>
          <li>Kennedy created the <strong>Peace Corps</strong> (1961), sending American volunteers to developing countries to help with education, healthcare, and farming</li>
          <li>Unemployment fell from <strong>4.5 million to 3.5 million</strong> during Kennedy&rsquo;s time in office</li>
          <li>Kennedy appointed African Americans to <strong>federal courts</strong>, including <strong>Thurgood Marshall</strong> to the Court of Appeals</li>
        </ul>

        <p>However, Kennedy&rsquo;s major proposals on <strong>Medicare, federal aid to education, and civil rights</strong> were all blocked by Congress before his assassination on <strong>22 November 1963</strong>. Many historians argue that the New Frontier promised far more than it delivered.</p>

        <h2>Johnson&rsquo;s Great Society (1964&ndash;1968)</h2>

        <p>When <strong>Lyndon B. Johnson</strong> became president after Kennedy&rsquo;s assassination, he was determined to push through Kennedy&rsquo;s unfinished reforms &mdash; and go far beyond them. Johnson was a master of <dfn class="term" data-def="Lyndon Johnson was famous for his ability to persuade, pressure, and charm members of Congress into supporting his legislation.">congressional politics</dfn>. He had served as Senate Majority Leader for years and knew how to twist arms, make deals, and get laws passed in a way Kennedy never could.</p>

        <p>In May 1964, Johnson outlined his vision at the University of Michigan. He declared that America could build a <strong>&ldquo;Great Society&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; a nation free from poverty and racial injustice. He then won the <strong>1964 election</strong> in a landslide against Republican <strong>Barry Goldwater</strong>, carrying <strong>61%</strong> of the popular vote. This gave him a huge mandate and large Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress.</p>

        <h3>The War on Poverty</h3>

        <p>Even before the 1964 election, Johnson declared an &ldquo;unconditional <dfn class="term" data-def="The name given to President Johnson&rsquo;s campaign to eliminate poverty in America, announced in his State of the Union address in January 1964.">War on Poverty</dfn>&rdquo; in his <strong>State of the Union address in January 1964</strong>. The centrepiece was the <strong>Economic Opportunity Act</strong>, signed on <strong>20 August 1964</strong>. It created the <strong>Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO)</strong> to coordinate anti-poverty programmes across the federal government.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Key War on Poverty Programmes</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Head Start</strong> (1965): Pre-school education programme for children from low-income families, providing early learning, nutrition, and healthcare. By 1968, over <strong>2 million children</strong> had been enrolled</li>
            <li><strong>Job Corps</strong> (1964): Residential training centres offering education and vocational skills to disadvantaged young people aged 16&ndash;24. By 1968, over <strong>100,000 young people</strong> had enrolled</li>
            <li><strong>Community Action Program (CAP)</strong>: Funded local anti-poverty organisations with &ldquo;maximum feasible participation&rdquo; of the poor themselves in decision-making</li>
            <li><strong>Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)</strong>: A domestic version of the Peace Corps, sending volunteers to work in impoverished communities</li>
            <li><strong>Food Stamps Act</strong> (1964): Expanded the food stamp programme to help low-income families afford food</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Medicare and Medicaid (1965)</h3>

        <p>One of the Great Society&rsquo;s most lasting achievements was <strong>Medicare</strong> and <strong>Medicaid</strong>, signed into law on <strong>30 July 1965</strong>.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Medicare</strong> gave federal health insurance to all Americans aged <strong>65 and over</strong>, regardless of income. It covered hospital stays and, through an optional plan, doctor visits. This was the reform Kennedy had failed to pass</li>
          <li><strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A joint federal and state programme providing health insurance for people on very low incomes, signed into law alongside Medicare in July 1965.">Medicaid</dfn></strong> gave health insurance to Americans on very low incomes, funded jointly by federal and state governments</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Before Medicare, around <strong>half of all Americans over 65</strong> had no health insurance. By <strong>1966</strong>, <strong>19 million elderly Americans</strong> had enrolled. These programmes remain the foundation of America&rsquo;s public healthcare system today.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>

        <p>Johnson, a former schoolteacher, saw education as the key to breaking the cycle of poverty. His major reforms included:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)</strong> of <strong>1965</strong> &mdash; the first major federal funding for schools. It provided <strong>over $1 billion</strong> in its first year, targeted at low-income areas</li>
          <li>The <strong>Higher Education Act</strong> (1965) created federal scholarships and low-interest loans for university students from poorer families</li>
          <li>The <strong>Head Start</strong> programme (described above) gave pre-school education to disadvantaged children</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Federal spending on education rose from <strong>$2.3 billion in 1963</strong> to <strong>$12.3 billion by 1970</strong> &mdash; a huge increase that transformed schools in the poorest communities.</p>

              <p><strong>Housing:</strong> The <strong>Housing and Urban Development Act</strong> (1965) funded low-income housing. <strong>Robert Weaver</strong> became the first African American in a president&rsquo;s cabinet as head of the new Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The <strong>Model Cities Act</strong> (1966) targeted the most run-down urban areas. The <strong>Fair Housing Act</strong> (1968) banned racial discrimination in housing &mdash; making it illegal to refuse to sell or rent to someone because of their race.</p>
              <p><strong>Immigration:</strong> The <strong>Immigration and Nationality Act</strong> (1965) scrapped the discriminatory national origins quota system from the 1920s. It replaced it with a system based on skills and family ties, greatly increasing immigration from Asia, Latin America, and Africa.</p>
              <p><strong>Consumer protection:</strong> New laws improved car safety, required clearer labelling on food and medicines, and protected consumers from dangerous products.</p>
              <p><strong>Environment:</strong> The <strong>Wilderness Act</strong> (1964) protected 9 million acres of land. The <strong>Clean Air Act</strong> (1963) and <strong>Water Quality Act</strong> (1965) set federal standards to tackle pollution.</p>
              <p><strong>Civil rights:</strong> The <strong>Civil Rights Act</strong> (1964) banned racial discrimination in employment and public places. The <strong>Voting Rights Act</strong> (1965) outlawed discriminatory voting practices. These are covered in earlier lessons.</p>

        <p>Johnson&rsquo;s Great Society achieved real results:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>poverty rate fell from 22% in 1960 to 13% by 1968</strong> &mdash; the biggest drop in poverty in American history</li>
          <li>The number living below the poverty line fell from <strong>40 million to 25 million</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Medicare and Medicaid</strong> gave millions of elderly and poor Americans healthcare for the first time</li>
          <li><strong>Head Start</strong> gave early education to millions of disadvantaged children and still runs today</li>
          <li>Federal education spending transformed schools in the poorest areas</li>
          <li><strong>African American poverty</strong> fell from <strong>55% in 1960 to 32% by 1968</strong></li>
          <li>Infant mortality dropped and life expectancy rose, especially among the poorest</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Limitations and Criticisms</h2>

        <p>Despite its achievements, the Great Society faced criticism from <strong>both left and right</strong>:</p>

        <h3>Criticisms from the Right (Conservatives)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The programmes were <strong>too expensive</strong> and created <strong>welfare dependency</strong> instead of self-reliance</li>
          <li>The federal government was growing <strong>too large</strong>, interfering in areas best left to individuals and states</li>
          <li>Some programmes, like the <strong>Community Action Program</strong>, were seen as funding radical activist groups</li>
          <li>The programmes did not tackle the <strong>root causes</strong> of poverty &mdash; poor education, family breakdown, and lack of jobs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Criticisms from the Left (Liberals and Radicals)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The programmes did not go <strong>far enough</strong> &mdash; poverty remained widespread and the rich&ndash;poor gap was still huge</li>
          <li>Funding was <strong>inadequate</strong>: many programmes were underfunded from the start, then cut further as Vietnam spending rose</li>
          <li>The programmes failed to address <strong>structural racism</strong> built into American society</li>
          <li><strong>African Americans</strong> still faced discrimination in housing, employment, and education despite the new laws</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Impact of the Vietnam War</h3>

        <p>The biggest factor that undermined the Great Society was the <strong>Vietnam War</strong>. As American involvement grew from 1965, the cost soared &mdash; from <strong>$6 billion in 1966</strong> to <strong>$26 billion by 1968</strong>. Johnson had to choose between funding his domestic programmes and funding the war. The war won. Great Society programmes were cut back, and the &ldquo;War on Poverty&rdquo; was overshadowed by Vietnam. As <strong>Martin Luther King Jr.</strong> said in 1967, the Great Society had been &ldquo;shot down on the battlefields of Vietnam.&rdquo;</p>

              <p><strong>Kennedy</strong> set the agenda and raised awareness of poverty, but achieved little in practice. He faced a hostile Congress and was in office for only <strong>1,036 days</strong>. His greatest contribution was inspiring the belief that government <em>should</em> act on poverty and inequality.</p>
              <p><strong>Johnson</strong> was far more effective at getting laws through Congress. Between <strong>1964 and 1966</strong>, he passed over <strong>200 pieces of legislation</strong> &mdash; more than any president since FDR. His political skill, public sympathy after Kennedy&rsquo;s assassination, and his landslide election win gave him the power to push through reforms Kennedy could not.</p>
              <p>However, Johnson&rsquo;s legacy was <strong>overshadowed by Vietnam</strong>. By 1968, the war had destroyed his presidency, split the Democratic Party, and diverted resources from reform. Johnson chose not to seek re-election in March 1968.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Questions often ask <strong>&ldquo;how far&rdquo;</strong> Kennedy and Johnson succeeded in reducing poverty. You need <strong>balance</strong>: acknowledge the achievements (poverty falling from 22% to 13%, Medicare, Head Start) but also explain the <strong>limits</strong> (25 million still in poverty, Vietnam diverting funds, conservative opposition, structural racism). Use <strong>specific statistics and named laws</strong> &mdash; the examiner rewards precise evidence. Compare Kennedy and Johnson: Kennedy set the vision but achieved little; Johnson passed the laws but was undone by Vietnam.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Kennedy&rsquo;s New Frontier and Johnson&rsquo;s Great Society were the boldest attempt to tackle poverty since the New Deal. Johnson nearly halved the poverty rate, gave millions healthcare through Medicare and Medicaid, and transformed education through Head Start. Kennedy contributed the Peace Corps, reduced unemployment, and appointed African Americans to federal courts. Yet the Great Society fell short. Conservative opposition, structural racism, and above all the Vietnam War meant the &ldquo;War on Poverty&rdquo; was never fully won. The <strong>Fair Housing Act</strong> (1968) was a late landmark, but millions of Americans still lived in poverty.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kennedy&rsquo;s New Frontier</strong> set the agenda but was mostly blocked by Congress. Johnson&rsquo;s political skill let him pass over 200 laws, including Medicare, Medicaid, and the Economic Opportunity Act.</li>
          <li><strong>Real progress was made:</strong> poverty fell from 22% to 13% (1960&ndash;1968) and programmes like Head Start and Job Corps helped millions.</li>
          <li><strong>The Vietnam War</strong> diverted billions from domestic reform, destroyed Johnson&rsquo;s presidency, and left the &ldquo;War on Poverty&rdquo; incomplete.</li>

Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which the programmes helped Americans.\nExample: Medicare and Medicaid, signed into law on 30 July 1965, gave health insurance to elderly Americans (over 65) and those on very low incomes. Before Medicare, around half of all Americans over 65 had no health insurance. By 1966, 19 million elderly Americans had enrolled, giving them access to healthcare they could not previously afford.\n\nAnother example: The Head Start programme (1965) provided pre-school education, nutrition, and healthcare to children from low-income families.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: The New Frontier and Great Society affected different groups in different ways and to different degrees. Kennedy raised the minimum wage from $1.00 to $1.25 and reduced unemployment from 4.5 million to 3.5 million, but his major proposals (Medicare, education, civil rights) were all blocked by Congress. Johnson, a master of congressional politics, succeeded where Kennedy failed \u2014 passing over 200 pieces of legislation between 1964 and 1966. Medicare and Medicaid (1965) transformed healthcare for the elderly and poor: 19 million enrolled by 1966. Head Start gave pre-school education to over 2 million disadvantaged children by 1968. The poverty rate fell from 22% in 1960 to 13% by 1968, and African American poverty dropped from 55% to 32%. However, the impact was uneven. Conservatives argued the programmes created welfare dependency, while liberals said they did not go far enough \u2014 25 million Americans still lived in poverty. The Vietnam War ultimately undermined everything: costs soared to $26 billion by 1968, diverting funds from domestic programmes. The Great Society helped millions but fell short of its promise.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty, launched in January 1964, had significant but uneven effects on the poorest Americans. The Economic Opportunity Act created the Office of Economic Opportunity to coordinate anti-poverty programmes. Head Start (1965) enrolled over 2 million children in pre-school by 1968, giving them early education, nutrition, and healthcare that helped break the cycle of poverty. Job Corps provided vocational training to over 100,000 disadvantaged young people aged 16\u201324. The Food Stamps Act (1964) helped low-income families afford food. Medicaid gave health insurance to the poorest. The results were real: the number living below the poverty line fell from 40 million to 25 million. African American poverty dropped from 55% to 32%. However, the programmes were criticised from both sides. Conservatives saw the Community Action Program as funding radical activists, while liberals argued funding was inadequate from the start. The Vietnam War then cut funding further, and structural racism meant African Americans still faced discrimination despite new laws. The War on Poverty helped millions but was never fully won.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Civil rights campaigns and presidential action were deeply interconnected \u2014 neither alone could have brought the changes that occurred. The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955\u201356), sit-ins, Freedom Rides, and Birmingham campaign created irresistible pressure for change through mass protest and media coverage. Without Bull Connor\u2019s fire hoses being broadcast on television, Kennedy might never have drafted the Civil Rights Bill in 1963. However, campaigns alone could not pass laws. Kennedy raised the minimum wage, created the Peace Corps, and began drafting civil rights legislation, but his major proposals were blocked by Congress. It took Johnson\u2019s extraordinary political skill to pass over 200 pieces of legislation, including the Civil Rights Act (1964), Voting Rights Act (1965), Medicare, Medicaid, and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The poverty rate fell from 22% to 13%. Yet Johnson only had the political will because campaigns like Selma\u2019s Bloody Sunday (1965) forced action. On balance, the campaigns created the demand for change, while presidential action turned that demand into law. Both were necessary; neither was sufficient alone.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): The Birmingham campaign (1963) and Selma marches (1965) created the pressure that forced presidents to act. Television images of children being attacked by fire hoses and peaceful marchers being beaten on Bloody Sunday shocked the nation.\nExample (bullet 2): Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act (1964) banning racial discrimination and the Voting Rights Act (1965) securing Black voting rights.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both Kennedy and Johnson aimed to reduce poverty, but Johnson achieved far more. Kennedy raised the minimum wage from $1.00 to $1.25, passed the Area Redevelopment Act giving loans to depressed areas, and created the Peace Corps. Unemployment fell from 4.5 million to 3.5 million during his presidency. However, his major proposals \u2014 Medicare, federal aid to education, and civil rights \u2014 were all blocked by a Congress where Southern Democrats allied with Republicans against reform. Kennedy was in office for only 1,036 days before his assassination. Johnson, by contrast, was a master of congressional politics who had served as Senate Majority Leader. He passed over 200 laws, including Medicare and Medicaid (19 million elderly enrolled by 1966), Head Start (2 million children by 1968), the Economic Opportunity Act, and the Food Stamps Act. The poverty rate fell from 22% to 13% and African American poverty dropped from 55% to 32%. Yet Kennedy deserves credit for setting the agenda \u2014 Johnson built on Kennedy\u2019s vision and used the sympathy after his assassination to push through reforms. However, the Vietnam War (costing $26 billion by 1968) ultimately diverted funds and left Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty incomplete. Johnson had more impact, but his legacy was undermined by Vietnam.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Kennedy raised the minimum wage and reduced unemployment from 4.5 to 3.5 million, but his major reforms like Medicare were blocked by Congress. He was president for only 1,036 days.\nExample (bullet 2): Johnson passed Medicare, Medicaid, Head Start, and the Economic Opportunity Act. The poverty rate fell from 22% to 13% and federal education spending rose from $2.3 billion in 1963 to $12.3 billion by 1970.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Johnson\u2019s Head Start programme gave pre-school education to over 2 million disadvantaged children by 1968, helping them escape the cycle of poverty.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Johnson did more than Kennedy because he passed more laws.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."
