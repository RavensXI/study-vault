        <h2>How Far Did America Change, 1920&ndash;1973?</h2>

        <p>This lesson provides an <strong>overview and evaluation</strong> of how far the United States changed between 1920 and 1973. This is a crucial topic for the AQA exam, as you will need to assess the extent of change across political, social, and economic dimensions &mdash; and reach a <strong>balanced judgement</strong> about what improved, what did not, and for whom.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Big Question</div>
          <p>The central question of this unit is: <strong>How far was America a land of opportunity and equality by 1973?</strong> The answer requires you to weigh up genuine progress against continuing inequality, and to consider whether change was experienced equally by different groups in American society.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Political Change</h2>

        <h3>What Improved</h3>

              <p><strong>Voting rights:</strong> In 1920, African Americans in the South were effectively prevented from voting by Jim Crow laws, poll taxes, literacy tests, and violence. By 1973, the Voting Rights Act (1965) had transformed the situation: Black voter registration in Mississippi rose from <strong>6.7% to 59.8%</strong>, and the number of Black elected officials nationwide increased from fewer than 100 to over <strong>2,600</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>Women&rsquo;s suffrage to political influence:</strong> Women gained the right to vote in 1920 with the 19th Amendment. By 1973, women were increasingly active in politics, though they remained severely underrepresented in Congress and executive positions.</p>
              <p><strong>Expanded democracy:</strong> The 26th Amendment (1971) lowered the voting age to 18, extending democratic participation to young people.</p>
              <p><strong>Federal government role:</strong> The New Deal of the 1930s fundamentally changed the relationship between the government and the people. Before the Depression, the federal government played a minimal role in citizens&rsquo; lives. By 1973, Americans expected the government to provide a safety net through Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programmes.</p>
              <p><strong>Landmark legislation:</strong> The Civil Rights Act (1964), Voting Rights Act (1965), and Equal Pay Act (1963) established legal frameworks for equality that, while imperfect, represented enormous progress from the era of Jim Crow.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>What Had Not Changed</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Political power</strong> remained overwhelmingly in the hands of <strong>white men</strong> &mdash; no woman, African American, or Hispanic American had been president, vice president, or Supreme Court Chief Justice by 1973</li>
          <li>The <strong>Watergate scandal</strong> (unfolding in 1973) revealed deep corruption at the highest levels of government, further eroding public trust</li>
          <li>The Vietnam War had created a <strong>credibility gap</strong> between the government and the people that would take decades to heal</li>
          <li>Native Americans still had <strong>limited political representation</strong> and sovereignty was frequently undermined</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Social Change</h2>

        <h3>What Improved</h3>

              <p><strong>End of legal segregation:</strong> The most dramatic social change was the dismantling of the Jim Crow system. In 1920, the Southern states enforced rigid racial segregation in every aspect of life. By 1973, legal segregation had been abolished, and public facilities, schools, and businesses were legally required to serve all Americans regardless of race.</p>
              <p><strong>Cultural change:</strong> American culture had been transformed. The Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, the jazz age, rock and roll, and the counterculture had challenged racial and social boundaries. By 1973, Black culture, music, and art were celebrated as central to American identity rather than marginalised.</p>
              <p><strong>Women&rsquo;s roles:</strong> Women&rsquo;s lives had changed enormously. In 1920, most women were expected to be housewives and mothers. By 1973, women were entering the workforce in ever-greater numbers, attending university at higher rates, and had gained legal rights including protection against employment discrimination and the right to abortion (Roe v. Wade, 1973).</p>
              <p><strong>Greater tolerance:</strong> The counterculture and rights movements had created a society that was, in many ways, more <strong>open, diverse, and tolerant</strong> than the conformist America of the 1950s. Attitudes towards race, gender, and personal freedom had shifted significantly.</p>
              <p><strong>Education:</strong> Access to education had expanded dramatically. The GI Bill (1944) had sent millions to college. By 1973, university enrolment included far more women, African Americans, and other minorities than in 1920, aided by Title IX (1972) and affirmative action policies.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>De facto segregation</strong> remained a reality in housing, schools, and social life across Northern and Western cities</li>
            <li><strong>Racial violence and police brutality</strong> continued to plague Black communities</li>
            <li>The <strong>gender pay gap</strong> persisted &mdash; women still earned significantly less than men</li>
            <li><strong>Native Americans</strong> remained the poorest group in America, with life expectancy 20 years below the national average</li>
            <li>The <strong>Equal Rights Amendment</strong> failed, showing the limits of the women&rsquo;s movement</li>
            <li>Despite the counterculture, a large &ldquo;silent majority&rdquo; remained socially <strong>conservative</strong></li>

              <p><strong>Rising living standards:</strong> The American economy had been transformed between 1920 and 1973. Despite the Great Depression, the long-term trend was one of <strong>rising prosperity</strong>. By 1973, the average American enjoyed a standard of living that would have been unimaginable in 1920, with access to cars, televisions, refrigerators, and modern housing.</p>
              <p><strong>The post-war boom:</strong> The economic boom that followed World War Two created the largest middle class in history. Suburbs expanded, home ownership soared, and consumer culture became central to American identity.</p>
              <p><strong>Safety net:</strong> The New Deal and Great Society programmes created a <strong>social safety net</strong> that did not exist in 1920. Social Security (1935), Medicare and Medicaid (1965), food stamps, and public housing provided basic protections for the elderly, the poor, and the vulnerable.</p>
              <p><strong>Labour rights:</strong> Workers gained significant protections through the New Deal era, including the right to join unions, minimum wage laws, and workplace safety regulations. Cesar Chavez&rsquo;s UFW campaigns extended some of these protections to previously unprotected farm workers.</p>
              <p><strong>Black middle class:</strong> A growing Black middle class emerged, particularly after the Civil Rights Act opened up employment and educational opportunities. The percentage of Black families in professional and managerial occupations increased significantly.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>What Had Not Changed</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Racial economic inequality</strong> remained vast: Black family income was still only <strong>61%</strong> of white family income in 1970, and Black unemployment remained double the white rate</li>
          <li>Over <strong>30%</strong> of Black Americans lived below the poverty line</li>
          <li>The <strong>wealth gap</strong> was even larger than the income gap, as centuries of discrimination had prevented Black families from accumulating property, savings, and investments</li>
          <li><strong>Women</strong> still earned around 60 cents for every dollar earned by men</li>
          <li><strong>Native Americans and Hispanic Americans</strong> continued to face severe economic disadvantage</li>
          <li>The boom of the post-war years was ending &mdash; by 1973, America faced <strong>economic recession, inflation, and the oil crisis</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>A Balanced Assessment</h2>

        <p>So how far was America a land of opportunity and equality by 1973? The answer is <strong>complex and requires balance</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Balanced Judgement</div>
          <p>The progress was <strong>real and significant</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Legal segregation was abolished</li>
            <li>Voting rights were secured</li>
            <li>Women gained greater legal equality</li>
            <li>Living standards rose dramatically</li>
            <li>The federal government accepted responsibility for social welfare</li>
          </ul>
          <p>But <strong>deep inequalities persisted</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>De facto segregation remained entrenched</li>
            <li>Economic inequality along racial and gender lines was vast</li>
            <li>Native Americans and Hispanic Americans remained severely disadvantaged</li>
            <li>The promise of the American Dream remained unfulfilled for millions</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>The key judgement:</strong> America in 1973 was a <em>fundamentally different</em> country from America in 1920 &mdash; more democratic, more legally equal, and more prosperous. But it was <em>not yet</em> the land of equal opportunity that it claimed to be. The legal framework for equality had been established, but translating legal rights into genuine equality of opportunity and outcome remained the great unfinished business of American democracy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Themes Across the Period</h2>

        <p>When revising this unit, it is helpful to think about the <strong>key themes</strong> that connect the entire period from 1920 to 1973:</p>

        <div class="collapsible">

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>1. The tension between opportunity and inequality:</strong> Throughout the period, America offered enormous opportunities for some while excluding others. The 1920s boom benefited industrialists but not farmers or Black Americans. The post-war boom created a vast middle class but left minorities behind. This tension is at the heart of the AQA specification.</p>
              <p><strong>2. The role of the federal government:</strong> The period saw a fundamental shift in the government&rsquo;s role. From laissez-faire in the 1920s, through the interventionism of the New Deal, to the civil rights legislation of the 1960s, the federal government increasingly took responsibility for protecting citizens&rsquo; rights and welfare.</p>
              <p><strong>3. The power of protest:</strong> Every major change in this period was driven by protest and activism &mdash; from the civil rights movement to women&rsquo;s liberation, from the anti-war movement to the counterculture. The methods varied (legal challenges, non-violent direct action, boycotts, riots), but the pattern was consistent: change came when ordinary people demanded it.</p>
              <p><strong>4. The gap between ideals and reality:</strong> America&rsquo;s founding ideals of equality and freedom were constantly tested by the reality of racism, sexism, and economic inequality. The civil rights movement explicitly appealed to these ideals, arguing that America was failing to live up to its own promises.</p>
              <p><strong>5. The media as a catalyst for change:</strong> From radio in the 1920s to television in the 1960s, the media played an increasingly important role in shaping public opinion and driving social change. The Birmingham protests, the Vietnam War, and the counterculture were all amplified by media coverage.</p>

        <p>This overview lesson is perfect preparation for <strong>&ldquo;How far...?&rdquo; and &ldquo;To what extent...?&rdquo;</strong> exam questions. These questions demand a <strong>balanced, evaluative answer</strong>. Structure your response by examining evidence of change alongside evidence of continuity. Use <strong>specific facts, dates, and statistics</strong> from across the entire period (not just one decade). Always reach a <strong>clear judgement</strong> in your conclusion &mdash; for example: &ldquo;America changed significantly in legal and political terms, but genuine equality of opportunity remained elusive for minorities and women.&rdquo; The examiner rewards answers that show you can weigh evidence and make a supported argument.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Between 1920 and 1973, America underwent transformative change. The economic boom and bust of the 1920s and 1930s reshaped the role of government through the New Deal. The post-war boom created unprecedented prosperity, while the Cold War and McCarthyism tested civil liberties. The civil rights movement dismantled legal segregation and secured voting rights, inspiring similar campaigns by women, Native Americans, and Hispanic Americans. The Vietnam War and the counterculture challenged American institutions and values, while the 1970s revealed the stubborn persistence of racial and economic inequality. By 1973, America was a more democratic, more legally equal, and more prosperous nation than it had been in 1920 &mdash; but it was not yet the land of equal opportunity that its founding ideals promised. The legal framework for equality was in place; the harder work of achieving genuine equality of opportunity and outcome continued.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Political change</strong> was dramatic: from Jim Crow voter suppression to the Voting Rights Act, from women&rsquo;s suffrage to increasing female political participation, and from laissez-faire government to an active welfare state.</li>
          <li><strong>Social change</strong> was significant but incomplete: legal segregation ended, cultural attitudes shifted, and women&rsquo;s roles transformed, but de facto segregation, racism, and sexism persisted.</li>
          <li><strong>Economic change</strong> brought rising living standards and a safety net, but deep racial and gender inequality in income, wealth, and opportunity remained.</li>
          <li><strong>The key judgement:</strong> The legal and political framework for equality was established between 1920 and 1973, but genuine equality of opportunity had not yet been achieved. America was a land of opportunity for many, but not for all.</li>
          <li><strong>For the exam:</strong> Always provide a balanced assessment, weigh evidence from across the period, use specific facts and statistics, and reach a clear, supported conclusion.</li>
