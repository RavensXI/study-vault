        <h2>The Sit-In Movement</h2>

        <p>On <strong>1 February 1960</strong>, four Black college students &mdash; Ezell Blair Jr., David Richmond, Franklin McCain, and Joseph McNeil &mdash; sat at a whites-only lunch counter at <dfn class="term" data-def="A Woolworth's department store in Greensboro, North Carolina, where four Black college students staged a sit-in at the whites-only lunch counter on 1 February 1960, sparking a wave of similar protests across the South.">Woolworth&rsquo;s</dfn> in Greensboro, North Carolina, and asked to be served. When refused, they stayed seated. This simple act sparked the <strong>sit-in movement</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Greensboro Sit-Ins</div>
          <p>Within two months, sit-ins had spread to <strong>54 cities</strong> across <strong>9 states</strong>. By the end of 1960, around <strong>70,000 people</strong> had taken part. Woolworth&rsquo;s in Greensboro desegregated its lunch counter on 25 July 1960. The movement inspired the <dfn class="term" data-def="The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, founded in April 1960 by young Black activists to coordinate student-led civil rights protests such as sit-ins and voter registration drives. SNCC played a key role in the Freedom Rides, Freedom Summer, and the March on Washington.">Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)</dfn>, founded in April 1960.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Freedom Rides (1961)</h2>

        <p>In 1960, the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Boynton v. Virginia</em> that segregation on interstate buses and in bus terminals was illegal. Southern states ignored this. To challenge their defiance, the <dfn class="term" data-def="The Congress of Racial Equality, a civil rights organisation founded in 1942 that organised the Freedom Rides in 1961. CORE pioneered non-violent direct action tactics in the civil rights movement.">Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)</dfn> organised the <strong>Freedom Rides</strong>.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p>On <strong>4 May 1961</strong>, 13 riders &mdash; Black and white &mdash; set off from Washington, D.C., on two buses heading through the Deep South. They sat in integrated groups and used whites-only facilities at bus stations.</p>
              <p>In <strong>Anniston, Alabama</strong>, one bus was <strong>firebombed</strong>. In <strong>Birmingham</strong>, riders were savagely beaten by Klansmen while police stood by. Commissioner <strong>Bull Connor</strong> had allegedly given the mob 15 minutes to attack before officers stepped in.</p>
              <p>New volunteers &mdash; many from SNCC &mdash; replaced the original riders. In <strong>Montgomery</strong>, riders were attacked again. Attorney General <strong>Robert Kennedy</strong> sent <strong>400 federal marshals</strong> to protect them.</p>
              <p>In September 1961, the <strong>Interstate Commerce Commission</strong> issued strict new rules banning segregation in interstate travel &mdash; and this time enforcement followed.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The Albany Movement (1961&ndash;62)</h2>

        <p>Not every campaign was a success. In <strong>Albany, Georgia</strong> (1961&ndash;62), King and the SCLC joined a broad local protest against segregation. But the police chief, <strong>Laurie Pritchett</strong>, studied King&rsquo;s tactics. Instead of using violent force, Pritchett quietly arrested protesters and avoided dramatic confrontations. Without shocking images for the media, the campaign attracted little national attention. Albany is seen as a <strong>failure for King</strong> &mdash; but he learned from it. He realised he needed opponents who would react with visible brutality to generate the media coverage the movement needed.</p>

        <h2>Birmingham, Alabama (1963)</h2>

        <p>In spring 1963, King and the SCLC launched a major campaign in <strong>Birmingham, Alabama</strong> &mdash; widely seen as the <strong>most segregated city in America</strong>. King chose Birmingham deliberately. He knew its racist police commissioner, <strong>Bull Connor</strong>, would respond with extreme violence, creating the media coverage that Albany had lacked.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Birmingham Campaign</div>
          <p>On <strong>2 May 1963</strong>, over <strong>1,000 Black schoolchildren</strong> marched through Birmingham in the <strong>Children&rsquo;s Crusade</strong>. Bull Connor ordered police to attack with <strong>fire hoses</strong>, <strong>police dogs</strong>, and <strong>batons</strong>. TV cameras broadcast the shocking images worldwide. President <strong>Kennedy</strong> said the footage made him &ldquo;sick&rdquo; and began drafting civil rights legislation.</p>
        </div>

        <p>While jailed during the campaign, King wrote his famous <dfn class="term" data-def="An open letter written by Martin Luther King Jr. on 16 April 1963 while imprisoned in Birmingham, Alabama. Addressed to white clergymen who had called the protests 'unwise,' King defended non-violent direct action and argued that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.">&ldquo;Letter from Birmingham Jail,&rdquo;</dfn> defending non-violent direct action: <em>&ldquo;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&rdquo;</em></p>

        <h2>The March on Washington (1963)</h2>

        <p>On <strong>28 August 1963</strong>, around <strong>250,000 people</strong> gathered at the Lincoln Memorial for the <dfn class="term" data-def="A massive civil rights rally held in Washington, D.C. on 28 August 1963, where an estimated 250,000 people gathered to demand civil rights legislation. It was here that Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech.">March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</dfn>. The crowd was notably interracial &mdash; around <strong>60,000</strong> were white.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; &ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo;</div>
          <p>King delivered his legendary <strong>&ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo;</strong> speech: <em>&ldquo;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&rdquo;</em> It was broadcast live on television and became one of the most famous speeches in history.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The march put huge pressure on Congress to pass civil rights legislation. But weeks later, a bomb killed <strong>four young girls</strong> &mdash; Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, and Carol Denise McNair &mdash; at the <strong>16th Street Baptist Church</strong> in Birmingham on 15 September 1963. The horror showed the struggle was far from over.</p>

        <h2>The Civil Rights Act (1964)</h2>

        <p>Kennedy introduced a civil rights bill in June 1963, but it stalled in Congress. After Kennedy&rsquo;s <strong>assassination on 22 November 1963</strong>, President <strong>Lyndon B. Johnson</strong> used his political skill &mdash; and the nation&rsquo;s grief &mdash; to push it through.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>In <strong>1964</strong>, King was awarded the <strong>Nobel Peace Prize</strong> for his non-violent leadership of the civil rights movement &mdash; global recognition of the movement&rsquo;s moral power.</p>

        <h2>Selma and the Voting Rights Act (1965)</h2>

        <p>Despite the Civil Rights Act, Black voters in the South still faced huge obstacles. In <strong>Selma, Alabama</strong>, only <strong>2%</strong> of eligible Black citizens were registered to vote due to intimidation, literacy tests, and deliberate obstruction.</p>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p>In early 1965, King and the SCLC launched a voter registration drive in Selma. On <strong>7 March 1965</strong>, around 600 marchers set out from Selma to Montgomery. At the Edmund Pettus Bridge, state troopers attacked them with <strong>tear gas, clubs, and mounted charges</strong>.</p>
              <p>This became <dfn class="term" data-def="The name given to 7 March 1965, when peaceful civil rights marchers in Selma, Alabama, were brutally attacked by state troopers as they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

              <p>A third march, with federal protection, completed the 54-mile journey on <strong>25 March 1965</strong>. <strong>25,000 marchers</strong> arrived in Montgomery.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The impact was dramatic: within a year, <strong>250,000</strong> new Black voters registered. In Mississippi, Black voter registration rose from <strong>6.7%</strong> to <strong>59.8%</strong> by 1968.</p>

        <h2>Malcolm X and Black Power</h2>

        <p>Not all African Americans backed King&rsquo;s non-violence and integration. <dfn class="term" data-def="Born Malcolm Little in 1925, Malcolm X was a minister of the Nation of Islam who advocated Black nationalism, self-defence, and racial pride. He rejected integration and non-violence, arguing that Black Americans should control their own communities.

His famous phrase was <strong>&ldquo;by any means necessary.&rdquo;</strong> He called King&rsquo;s March on Washington the &ldquo;Farce on Washington.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Malcolm X appealed especially to <strong>young Black Americans in Northern cities</strong>, where legal segregation did not exist but poverty, unemployment, and police brutality fuelled deep frustration. He argued that Black people should build their own businesses, schools, and communities.</p>
              <p>In 1964, he left the Nation of Islam and made a pilgrimage to Mecca, which led him to adopt a more inclusive worldview. He was <strong>assassinated on 21 February 1965</strong> in New York. His autobiography, published after his death, became hugely influential.</p>

        <h3>The Rise of Black Power</h3>

        <p>By the mid-1960s, many younger activists were frustrated with the slow pace of change and the continued violence against Black communities. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A political movement that emerged in the mid-1960s, emphasising racial pride, Black self-determination, and the creation of Black political and cultural institutions. The slogan was popularised by Stokely Carmichael of SNCC in 1966.">Black Power</dfn> movement emerged, rejecting non-violence in favour of racial pride and self-determination.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Black Power</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Stokely Carmichael</strong>, the new leader of SNCC, popularised the slogan &ldquo;Black Power&rdquo; in 1966. He expelled white members from SNCC, marking a clear shift from integration to Black separatism</li>
            <li>The <strong>Black Panther Party</strong>, founded in October 1966 by <strong>Huey Newton</strong> and <strong>Bobby Seale</strong> in Oakland, California, openly carried firearms, ran armed patrols to monitor police, and organised community programmes including free breakfasts for children</li>
            <li>At the <strong>1968 Mexico City Olympics</strong>, sprinters <strong>Tommie Smith and John Carlos</strong> raised <strong>black-gloved fists</strong> on the medal podium during the national anthem &mdash; a globally televised moment of Black Power protest that became one of the most iconic images of the era</li>
            <li>Black Power divided opinion &mdash; it inspired racial pride but alarmed white Americans and split the civil rights movement</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>The FBI and the Civil Rights Movement</h2>

        <p>FBI director <strong>J. Edgar Hoover</strong> was deeply hostile to both King and the Black Panthers. The FBI ran a secret programme called <strong>COINTELPRO</strong> to spy on, infiltrate, and discredit civil rights leaders. Hoover called King the &ldquo;most dangerous Negro in America&rdquo; and tried to destroy his reputation through surveillance and leaked recordings. The FBI also targeted the <strong>Black Panthers</strong>, raiding their offices and arresting their leaders. This government hostility shows how threatening the movement was to the American establishment.</p>

        <h2>Urban Riots and King&rsquo;s Assassination</h2>

        <p>Racial violence was not only a Southern problem. Through the mid-1960s, <strong>major riots</strong> erupted in Black neighbourhoods in Northern and Western cities, driven by poverty, poor housing, unemployment, and police brutality. The <strong>Watts riot</strong> in Los Angeles (<strong>1965</strong>) lasted six days &mdash; <strong>34 people died</strong>. <strong>Detroit</strong> and <strong>Newark</strong> both saw devastating riots in <strong>1967</strong>. These were not direct responses to Southern segregation but to the grinding inequality that Black Americans faced everywhere.</p>

        <p>On <strong>4 April 1968</strong>, Martin Luther King Jr. was <strong>assassinated</strong> by James Earl Ray in Memphis, Tennessee, where he had gone to support striking sanitation workers. King was just <strong>39 years old</strong>.</p>

        <p>His death triggered <strong>riots in over 100 cities</strong>, with the worst violence in Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Baltimore. The tragedy sped up the passage of the <strong>Civil Rights Act of 1968</strong> (the Fair Housing Act), banning discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Exam questions often ask you to evaluate the <strong>significance of different events or individuals</strong>. Compare <strong>multiple factors</strong> &mdash; was the March on Washington more important than Selma? Were legal changes or direct action more significant? Why did King fail at Albany but succeed at Birmingham? Always use <strong>specific evidence</strong> and reach a <strong>balanced judgement</strong>. Mentioning divisions within the movement (King vs. Malcolm X, non-violence vs. Black Power) shows top-level understanding.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1960s were the most dramatic decade of the civil rights movement. Through courage and sacrifice, activists won landmark laws &mdash; the Civil Rights Act (1964) and Voting Rights Act (1965) &mdash; that dismantled legal segregation and secured voting rights. But the decade also revealed deep divisions. Black Power challenged King&rsquo;s non-violence. Urban riots from Watts to Detroit showed that Northern inequality was just as explosive. The FBI worked to destroy both King and the Black Panthers. The assassinations of JFK, Malcolm X, and MLK showed that the legal battle may have been won, but genuine equality remained far off.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Non-violent direct action</strong> &mdash; sit-ins, Freedom Rides, and marches &mdash; exposed segregation&rsquo;s brutality and built public support through media coverage. King learned from Albany&rsquo;s failure to succeed at Birmingham.</li>
          <li><strong>The Civil Rights Act (1964)</strong> banned racial discrimination in public places and employment. King won the Nobel Peace Prize the same year.</li>
          <li><strong>The Voting Rights Act (1965)</strong> removed barriers to Black voting, transforming Southern politics.</li>
          <li><strong>Malcolm X and Black Power</strong> offered an alternative vision of racial pride and self-determination, reflecting frustrations in Northern cities where riots (Watts, Detroit, Newark) showed deep inequality.</li>
          <li><strong>King&rsquo;s assassination (1968)</strong> triggered riots in over 100 cities and showed the violence that still underpinned American racism.</li>
        </ul>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which events were significant.\nExample: King deliberately chose Birmingham because it was considered the most segregated city in America and its police commissioner, Bull Connor, was known for his racism. King calculated that Connor would respond with extreme violence, creating the shocking media images that the failed Albany campaign had lacked.\n\nAnother example: On 2 May 1963, over 1,000 Black schoolchildren marched through Birmingham in the Children\u2019s Crusade. Bull Connor ordered police to attack them with fire hoses, police dogs, and batons. Television cameras broadcast the shocking images worldwide, and President Kennedy said the footage made him \u2018sick\u2019 and began drafting civil rights legislation.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge. Students demonstrate relevant knowledge about the issue(s) identified.\nExample: Martin Luther King was arrested in Birmingham and wrote a famous letter from jail.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge and understanding. Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which their approaches differed.\nExample: King believed in non-violent direct action and integration \u2014 he argued that Black and white Americans should live together as equals and used peaceful protest methods like marches, boycotts, and sit-ins inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. His March on Washington in 1963 attracted 250,000 people, including around 60,000 white supporters, showing his belief in interracial cooperation.\n\nAnother example: Malcolm X rejected integration and non-violence, calling instead for Black nationalism, self-defence, and racial pride \u2014 his famous phrase was \u2018by any means necessary.\u2019 As a minister of the Nation of Islam, he argued that Black Americans should build their own separate communities, businesses, and schools rather than seeking acceptance from white society. He called King\u2019s March on Washington the \u2018Farce on Washington.\u2019\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge. Students demonstrate relevant knowledge about the issue(s) identified.\nExample: King believed in peaceful protest while Malcolm X supported self-defence.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: The events in Selma had both immediate and long-term effects on African Americans\u2019 lives. In Selma, only 2% of eligible Black citizens were registered to vote due to intimidation, literacy tests, and deliberate obstruction. King and the SCLC chose Selma precisely because the situation was so extreme. On Bloody Sunday (7 March 1965), state troopers attacked 600 peaceful marchers with tear gas, clubs, and mounted charges at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Television footage shocked the nation and built overwhelming public support for voting rights. This pressure directly led to the Voting Rights Act (1965), which banned literacy tests and other discriminatory practices. The impact was transformative: within a year, 250,000 new Black voters registered, and in Mississippi, Black voter registration rose from 6.7% to 59.8% by 1968. However, the Act primarily affected the South \u2014 for African Americans in Northern cities facing poverty, poor housing, and police brutality, Selma changed little in their daily lives.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Bloody Sunday created huge public sympathy for the movement and led directly to the Voting Rights Act (1965). This removed barriers to Black voting and within a year 250,000 new Black voters registered. The third march, with federal protection, completed the 54-mile journey with 25,000 marchers arriving in Montgomery.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: The Selma marches led to the Voting Rights Act, which meant more Black people could vote for the first time.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Selma helped African Americans gain voting rights.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        text: "In what ways were the lives of Americans affected by the rise of Black Power in the 1960s? Explain your answer.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: Black Power affected Americans in complex and contradictory ways. For young Black Americans in Northern cities, Black Power offered something King\u2019s movement had not \u2014 a sense of pride and self-determination. Stokely Carmichael popularised the slogan in 1966 and expelled white members from SNCC, marking a clear shift towards Black separatism. The Black Panther Party (founded 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale) ran armed patrols to monitor police brutality and organised community programmes including free breakfasts for children \u2014 providing real services in neglected communities. However, Black Power also divided the civil rights movement and alarmed many white Americans. The 1968 Olympics protest by Tommie Smith and John Carlos \u2014 raising black-gloved fists on the podium \u2014 was globally televised and polarised opinion. The FBI\u2019s COINTELPRO programme targeted both King and the Black Panthers, raiding offices and arresting leaders. Urban riots from Watts (1965, 34 dead) to Detroit and Newark (1967) reflected the frustration that fuelled Black Power but also caused a white backlash that shifted politics to the right.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Black Power inspired racial pride among African Americans, with the Black Panther Party running community programmes like free breakfasts for children. However, it also alarmed white Americans and the FBI ran COINTELPRO to spy on and discredit civil rights leaders. Hoover called King the \u2018most dangerous Negro in America.\u2019\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: The Black Panther Party was founded in 1966 and carried firearms to patrol Black communities, which scared many white Americans.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Black Power made some people feel proud of being Black.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        text: "Which of the following achieved more in the 1960s and early 1970s:\n\n\u2022 campaigns to improve the rights of African-Americans\n\u2022 campaigns to improve the rights of women?\n\nExplain your answer with reference to both bullet points.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both sets of campaigns achieved landmark legislation, but the civil rights movement produced more dramatic and immediate change. The Birmingham campaign (1963) and Selma marches (1965) created irresistible pressure for the Civil Rights Act (1964) \u2014 banning racial discrimination in public places and employment \u2014 and the Voting Rights Act (1965), which transformed Black political participation: Mississippi Black voter registration rose from 6.7% to 59.8% by 1968. King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Legal segregation, which had existed for almost a century, was dismantled within a few years. Women\u2019s campaigns also won important victories: the Equal Pay Act (1963), Title VII (1964) banning sex discrimination in employment, Title IX (1972) opening education, and Roe v. Wade (1973). But these had slower, less visible effects. The gender pay gap actually widened slightly \u2014 women earned only 57 cents per dollar by 1973. The ERA stalled at 35 states after Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s STOP ERA campaign mobilised conservative opposition. On balance, civil rights campaigns achieved more immediate, transformative change by 1973, though both faced the same problem: legal equality did not automatically produce genuine equality.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): The civil rights movement achieved the Civil Rights Act (1964) and Voting Rights Act (1965), ending legal segregation and securing Black voting rights. The March on Washington attracted 250,000 people and King\u2019s \u2018I Have a Dream\u2019 speech became iconic.\nExample (bullet 2): The feminist movement won the Equal Pay Act (1963), Title IX (1972), and Roe v. Wade (1973). Betty Friedan founded NOW in 1966, which pressured the EEOC to enforce Title VII on sex discrimination.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned racial discrimination in public places and was a major achievement of the civil rights campaigns.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Both campaigns helped improve people\u2019s rights.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        type: "12 marks \u2014 Which had more impact",
        text: "Which of the following had more impact on the civil rights movement:\n\n\u2022 Martin Luther King and non-violent protest\n\u2022 Malcolm X and Black Power?\n\nExplain your answer with reference to both bullet points.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: King\u2019s non-violent approach achieved the movement\u2019s greatest legislative victories: the Civil Rights Act (1964) and Voting Rights Act (1965). His strategy was brilliant \u2014 he learned from Albany\u2019s failure that he needed opponents who would react with visible brutality. Birmingham (1963) was chosen because Bull Connor would use fire hoses and dogs on children, creating the shocking footage that forced Kennedy to draft civil rights legislation. The March on Washington (250,000 people) and Selma\u2019s Bloody Sunday built irresistible public pressure. King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Malcolm X and Black Power had a different kind of impact. Malcolm X gave voice to the frustrations of Black Americans in Northern cities where legal segregation did not exist but poverty, unemployment, and police brutality did. The Black Panthers\u2019 community programmes \u2014 free breakfasts, health clinics \u2014 addressed real needs. The 1968 Olympics protest by Smith and Carlos became iconic. However, Black Power also triggered a white backlash and government repression through COINTELPRO. On balance, King\u2019s approach achieved more concrete legislative change, but Malcolm X and Black Power were essential in addressing the psychological dimension of racism and the specific problems of Northern urban communities that King\u2019s Southern campaigns did not reach.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): King\u2019s non-violent campaigns at Birmingham (1963) and Selma (1965) directly led to the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. He deliberately chose targets where violent opposition would create media coverage, and his \u2018I Have a Dream\u2019 speech inspired millions.\nExample (bullet 2): Malcolm X rejected King\u2019s non-violence, calling for Black nationalism and self-defence. He appealed to young Black Americans in Northern cities. After his assassination in 1965, his autobiography became hugely influential and the Black Power movement he inspired gave many African Americans a new sense of pride.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: King\u2019s March on Washington in 1963 attracted 250,000 people and helped persuade Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: King used peaceful protest while Malcolm X believed in self-defence.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."
