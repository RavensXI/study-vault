        <h2>Why Did the USA Get Involved in Vietnam?</h2>

        <p>America&rsquo;s involvement in Vietnam was driven by the <dfn class="term" data-def="The US foreign policy belief that if one country in a region fell to communism, neighbouring countries would follow like a row of dominoes. This theory was used to justify American intervention in Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia.">Domino Theory</dfn> &mdash; the Cold War belief that if one country fell to communism, its neighbours would follow like a row of dominoes. After China became communist in 1949 and the Korean War (1950&ndash;1953), the US was determined to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia.</p>

        <h2>The Gulf of Tonkin (1964)</h2>

        <h2>Escalation of the War</h2>

        <p>From 1965, the US dramatically escalated its involvement in Vietnam.</p>

        <h3>The Draft</h3>

          <li><strong>African Americans and working-class</strong> men were disproportionately drafted &mdash; in the early years of the war, Black soldiers made up <strong>25%</strong> of combat deaths despite being only 11% of the population</li>
          <li>The average age of an American soldier in Vietnam was just <strong>19</strong></li>

        <p>Only one officer, <strong>Lieutenant William Calley</strong>, was convicted. He was sentenced to life imprisonment but served just <strong>three and a half years</strong> under house arrest.

        <h2>The Anti-War Movement</h2>

        <p>Opposition to the Vietnam War grew steadily through the 1960s, becoming one of the largest protest movements in American history.</p>

              <p><strong>Cost:</strong> The war cost over <strong>$120 billion</strong>, diverting money from domestic programmes. Johnson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great Society&rdquo; anti-poverty programmes suffered as a result.</p>
              <p><strong>Moral concerns:</strong> The use of napalm, Agent Orange, and tactics like search-and-destroy raised serious moral questions. The My Lai massacre confirmed many people&rsquo;s worst fears about the conduct of the war.</p>

        <p>A common question asks about the <strong>role of the media</strong> in turning public opinion against the Vietnam War. To achieve top marks, consider <strong>multiple factors</strong> that fuelled opposition &mdash; the draft, rising casualties, cost, moral concerns, and the credibility gap &mdash; rather than attributing the change solely to television coverage. The best answers will weigh up which factor was <strong>most significant</strong> and explain why, using specific evidence such as the Tet Offensive, My Lai, and Kent State.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Vietnam War was the most divisive conflict in American history since the Civil War. What began as an effort to contain communism escalated into a devastating war that killed over 58,000 Americans and millions of Vietnamese. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution gave the president sweeping powers, the draft fell disproportionately on the working class and minorities, and the Tet Offensive shattered public confidence in the government&rsquo;s honesty. The anti-war movement, fuelled by television coverage and moral outrage, grew into a mass protest that fundamentally changed American politics and society. The war created a &ldquo;credibility gap&rdquo; between the government and the public that would have lasting consequences.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Domino Theory</strong> drove US involvement, but the war proved far more difficult than expected due to guerrilla tactics and the determination of the North Vietnamese.</li>
          <li><strong>The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (1964)</strong> gave the president authority to escalate without a formal declaration of war, based on a likely fabricated second attack.</li>
          <li><strong>The Tet Offensive (1968)</strong> was the psychological turning point, shattering the government&rsquo;s claim that the war was being won.</li>
          <li><strong>The anti-war movement</strong> was driven by multiple factors: television coverage, the unfair draft, rising casualties, cost, and moral outrage over atrocities like My Lai.</li>
          <li><strong>Kent State (1970)</strong> showed that the war was tearing America apart, as the government turned its firepower on its own citizens.</li>
