        <h2>The Sit-In Movement</h2>

        <p>On <strong>1 February 1960</strong>, four Black college students &mdash; Ezell Blair Jr., David Richmond, Franklin McCain, and Joseph McNeil &mdash; sat at a whites-only lunch counter at <dfn class="term" data-def="A Woolworth's department store in Greensboro, North Carolina, where four Black college students staged a sit-in at the whites-only lunch counter on 1 February 1960, sparking a wave of similar protests across the South.">Woolworth&rsquo;s</dfn> in Greensboro, North Carolina, and asked to be served. When refused, they stayed seated. This simple act sparked the <strong>sit-in movement</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Greensboro Sit-Ins</div>
          <p>Within two months, sit-ins had spread to <strong>54 cities</strong> across <strong>9 states</strong>. By the end of 1960, around <strong>70,000 people</strong> had taken part. Woolworth&rsquo;s in Greensboro desegregated its lunch counter on 25 July 1960. The movement inspired the <dfn class="term" data-def="The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, founded in April 1960 by young Black activists to coordinate student-led civil rights protests such as sit-ins and voter registration drives. SNCC played a key role in the Freedom Rides, Freedom Summer, and the March on Washington.">Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)</dfn>, founded in April 1960.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Freedom Rides (1961)</h2>

        <p>In 1960, the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Boynton v. Virginia</em> that segregation on interstate buses and in bus terminals was illegal. Southern states ignored this. To challenge their defiance, the <dfn class="term" data-def="The Congress of Racial Equality, a civil rights organisation founded in 1942 that organised the Freedom Rides in 1961. CORE pioneered non-violent direct action tactics in the civil rights movement.">Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)</dfn> organised the <strong>Freedom Rides</strong>.</p>

              <p>On <strong>4 May 1961</strong>, 13 riders &mdash; Black and white &mdash; set off from Washington, D.C., on two buses heading through the Deep South. They sat in integrated groups and used whites-only facilities at bus stations.</p>
              <p>In <strong>Anniston, Alabama</strong>, one bus was <strong>firebombed</strong>. In <strong>Birmingham</strong>, riders were savagely beaten by Klansmen while police stood by. Commissioner <strong>Bull Connor</strong> had allegedly given the mob 15 minutes to attack before officers stepped in.</p>
              <p>New volunteers &mdash; many from SNCC &mdash; replaced the original riders. In <strong>Montgomery</strong>, riders were attacked again. Attorney General <strong>Robert Kennedy</strong> sent <strong>400 federal marshals</strong> to protect them.</p>
              <p>In September 1961, the <strong>Interstate Commerce Commission</strong> issued strict new rules banning segregation in interstate travel &mdash; and this time enforcement followed.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The Albany Movement (1961&ndash;62)</h2>

        <p>Not every campaign was a success. In <strong>Albany, Georgia</strong> (1961&ndash;62), King and the SCLC joined a broad local protest against segregation. But the police chief, <strong>Laurie Pritchett</strong>, studied King&rsquo;s tactics. Instead of using violent force, Pritchett quietly arrested protesters and avoided dramatic confrontations. Without shocking images for the media, the campaign attracted little national attention. Albany is seen as a <strong>failure for King</strong> &mdash; but he learned from it. He realised he needed opponents who would react with visible brutality to generate the media coverage the movement needed.</p>

        <h2>Birmingham, Alabama (1963)</h2>

        <p>In spring 1963, King and the SCLC launched a major campaign in <strong>Birmingham, Alabama</strong> &mdash; widely seen as the <strong>most segregated city in America</strong>. King chose Birmingham deliberately. He knew its racist police commissioner, <strong>Bull Connor</strong>, would respond with extreme violence, creating the media coverage that Albany had lacked.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Birmingham Campaign</div>
          <p>On <strong>2 May 1963</strong>, over <strong>1,000 Black schoolchildren</strong> marched through Birmingham in the <strong>Children&rsquo;s Crusade</strong>. Bull Connor ordered police to attack with <strong>fire hoses</strong>, <strong>police dogs</strong>, and <strong>batons</strong>. TV cameras broadcast the shocking images worldwide. President <strong>Kennedy</strong> said the footage made him &ldquo;sick&rdquo; and began drafting civil rights legislation.</p>
        </div>

        <p>While jailed during the campaign, King wrote his famous <dfn class="term" data-def="An open letter written by Martin Luther King Jr. on 16 April 1963 while imprisoned in Birmingham, Alabama. Addressed to white clergymen who had called the protests 'unwise,' King defended non-violent direct action and argued that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.">&ldquo;Letter from Birmingham Jail,&rdquo;</dfn> defending non-violent direct action: <em>&ldquo;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&rdquo;</em></p>

        <h2>The March on Washington (1963)</h2>

        <p>On <strong>28 August 1963</strong>, around <strong>250,000 people</strong> gathered at the Lincoln Memorial for the <dfn class="term" data-def="A massive civil rights rally held in Washington, D.C. on 28 August 1963, where an estimated 250,000 people gathered to demand civil rights legislation. It was here that Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech.">March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</dfn>. The crowd was notably interracial &mdash; around <strong>60,000</strong> were white.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; &ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo;</div>
          <p>King delivered his legendary <strong>&ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo;</strong> speech: <em>&ldquo;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&rdquo;</em> It was broadcast live on television and became one of the most famous speeches in history.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The march put huge pressure on Congress to pass civil rights legislation. But weeks later, a bomb killed <strong>four young girls</strong> &mdash; Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, and Carol Denise McNair &mdash; at the <strong>16th Street Baptist Church</strong> in Birmingham on 15 September 1963. The horror showed the struggle was far from over.</p>

        <h2>The Civil Rights Act (1964)</h2>

        <p>Kennedy introduced a civil rights bill in June 1963, but it stalled in Congress. After Kennedy&rsquo;s <strong>assassination on 22 November 1963</strong>, President <strong>Lyndon B. Johnson</strong> used his political skill &mdash; and the nation&rsquo;s grief &mdash; to push it through.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Civil Rights Act 1964</div>
          <p>Signed on <strong>2 July 1964</strong>, the Act:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Banned discrimination</strong> based on race, colour, religion, sex, or national origin in employment and public places</li>
            <li><strong>Outlawed segregation</strong> in schools, restaurants, hotels, theatres, and all public facilities</li>
            <li>Set up the <strong>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</strong> to enforce workplace anti-discrimination laws</li>
            <li>Let the federal government <strong>withhold funding</strong> from institutions that practised discrimination</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>In <strong>1964</strong>, King was awarded the <strong>Nobel Peace Prize</strong> for his non-violent leadership of the civil rights movement &mdash; global recognition of the movement&rsquo;s moral power.</p>

        <h2>Selma and the Voting Rights Act (1965)</h2>

        <p>Despite the Civil Rights Act, Black voters in the South still faced huge obstacles. In <strong>Selma, Alabama</strong>, only <strong>2%</strong> of eligible Black citizens were registered to vote due to intimidation, literacy tests, and deliberate obstruction.</p>

              <p>In early 1965, King and the SCLC launched a voter registration drive in Selma. On <strong>7 March 1965</strong>, around 600 marchers set out from Selma to Montgomery.

            <li>Required states with a history of discrimination to get <strong>federal approval</strong> before changing voting laws</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The impact was dramatic: within a year, <strong>250,000</strong> new Black voters registered. In Mississippi, Black voter registration rose from <strong>6.7%</strong> to <strong>59.8%</strong> by 1968.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Malcolm X and Black Power</h2>

        <p>Not all African Americans backed King&rsquo;s non-violence and integration. <dfn class="term" data-def="Born Malcolm Little in 1925, Malcolm X was a minister of the Nation of Islam who advocated Black nationalism, self-defence, and racial pride.

His famous phrase was <strong>&ldquo;by any means necessary.&rdquo;</strong> He called King&rsquo;s March on Washington the &ldquo;Farce on Washington.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Malcolm X appealed especially to <strong>young Black Americans in Northern cities</strong>, where legal segregation did not exist but poverty, unemployment, and police brutality fuelled deep frustration. He argued that Black people should build their own businesses, schools, and communities.</p>
              <p>In 1964, he left the Nation of Islam and made a pilgrimage to Mecca, which led him to adopt a more inclusive worldview. He was <strong>assassinated on 21 February 1965</strong> in New York. His autobiography, published after his death, became hugely influential.</p>

        <h3>The Rise of Black Power</h3>

        <p>By the mid-1960s, many younger activists were frustrated with the slow pace of change and the continued violence against Black communities. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A political movement that emerged in the mid-1960s, emphasising racial pride, Black self-determination, and the creation of Black political and cultural institutions. The slogan was popularised by Stokely Carmichael of SNCC in 1966.">Black Power</dfn> movement emerged, rejecting non-violence in favour of racial pride and self-determination.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Black Power</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Stokely Carmichael</strong>, the new leader of SNCC, popularised the slogan &ldquo;Black Power&rdquo; in 1966. He expelled white members from SNCC, marking a clear shift from integration to Black separatism</li>
            <li>The <strong>Black Panther Party</strong>, founded in October 1966 by <strong>Huey Newton</strong> and <strong>Bobby Seale</strong> in Oakland, California, openly carried firearms, ran armed patrols to monitor police, and organised community programmes including free breakfasts for children</li>
            <li>At the <strong>1968 Mexico City Olympics</strong>, sprinters <strong>Tommie Smith and John Carlos</strong> raised <strong>black-gloved fists</strong> on the medal podium during the national anthem &mdash; a globally televised moment of Black Power protest that became one of the most iconic images of the era</li>
            <li>Black Power divided opinion &mdash; it inspired racial pride but alarmed white Americans and split the civil rights movement</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>The FBI and the Civil Rights Movement</h2>

        <p>FBI director <strong>J. Edgar Hoover</strong> was deeply hostile to both King and the Black Panthers. The FBI ran a secret programme called <strong>COINTELPRO</strong> to spy on, infiltrate, and discredit civil rights leaders. Hoover called King the &ldquo;most dangerous Negro in America&rdquo; and tried to destroy his reputation through surveillance and leaked recordings. The FBI also targeted the <strong>Black Panthers</strong>, raiding their offices and arresting their leaders. This government hostility shows how threatening the movement was to the American establishment.</p>

        <h2>Urban Riots and King&rsquo;s Assassination</h2>

        <p>Racial violence was not only a Southern problem. Through the mid-1960s, <strong>major riots</strong> erupted in Black neighbourhoods in Northern and Western cities, driven by poverty, poor housing, unemployment, and police brutality. The <strong>Watts riot</strong> in Los Angeles (<strong>1965</strong>) lasted six days &mdash; <strong>34 people died</strong>. <strong>Detroit</strong> and <strong>Newark</strong> both saw devastating riots in <strong>1967</strong>. These were not direct responses to Southern segregation but to the grinding inequality that Black Americans faced everywhere.</p>

        <p>On <strong>4 April 1968</strong>, Martin Luther King Jr. was <strong>assassinated</strong> by James Earl Ray in Memphis, Tennessee, where he had gone to support striking sanitation workers. King was just <strong>39 years old</strong>.</p>

        <p>His death triggered <strong>riots in over 100 cities</strong>, with the worst violence in Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Baltimore. The tragedy sped up the passage of the <strong>Civil Rights Act of 1968</strong> (the Fair Housing Act), banning discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing.</p>

        <p>Exam questions often ask you to evaluate the <strong>significance of different events or individuals</strong>. Compare <strong>multiple factors</strong> &mdash; was the March on Washington more important than Selma? Were legal changes or direct action more significant? Why did King fail at Albany but succeed at Birmingham? Always use <strong>specific evidence</strong> and reach a <strong>balanced judgement</strong>. Mentioning divisions within the movement (King vs. Malcolm X, non-violence vs. Black Power) shows top-level understanding.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1960s were the most dramatic decade of the civil rights movement. Through courage and sacrifice, activists won landmark laws &mdash; the Civil Rights Act (1964) and Voting Rights Act (1965) &mdash; that dismantled legal segregation and secured voting rights. But the decade also revealed deep divisions. Black Power challenged King&rsquo;s non-violence. Urban riots from Watts to Detroit showed that Northern inequality was just as explosive. The FBI worked to destroy both King and the Black Panthers. The assassinations of JFK, Malcolm X, and MLK showed that the legal battle may have been won, but genuine equality remained far off.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Non-violent direct action</strong> &mdash; sit-ins, Freedom Rides, and marches &mdash; exposed segregation&rsquo;s brutality and built public support through media coverage. King learned from Albany&rsquo;s failure to succeed at Birmingham.</li>
          <li><strong>The Civil Rights Act (1964)</strong> banned racial discrimination in public places and employment. King won the Nobel Peace Prize the same year.</li>
          <li><strong>The Voting Rights Act (1965)</strong> removed barriers to Black voting, transforming Southern politics.</li>
          <li><strong>Malcolm X and Black Power</strong> offered an alternative vision of racial pride and self-determination, reflecting frustrations in Northern cities where riots (Watts, Detroit, Newark) showed deep inequality.</li>
          <li><strong>King&rsquo;s assassination (1968)</strong> triggered riots in over 100 cities and showed the violence that still underpinned American racism.</li>
        </ul>
