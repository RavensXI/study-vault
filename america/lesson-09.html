        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The Post-War Economic Boom</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">After World War Two ended in <strong>1945</strong>, the United States entered a period of huge economic growth. Unlike the fragile boom of the 1920s, this one was sustained and widespread. The USA emerged as the world&rsquo;s dominant economic and military superpower. Many Americans felt they were living the <strong><dfn class="term" data-def="The belief that through hard work, anyone in America can achieve prosperity and success, regardless of their background.">American Dream</dfn></strong> &mdash; the idea that through hard work, anyone could achieve prosperity and success.</p>

        <figure data-narration-id="n3" class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_postwar_boom.png" alt="Infographic showing five key indicators of America's post-war economic boom (1945-1960): over 50% of world manufacturing, GNP doubled, unemployment below 5%, family income rose 30%, and 60 million TV sets by 1960">
        </figure>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n4">Why Did the Economy Boom?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wartime production:</strong> Factories switched from making tanks and aircraft to cars, fridges, and televisions. They were modern, efficient, and ready to meet demand.</li>
          <li><strong>Pent-up demand:</strong> Consumer goods had been rationed during the war. Americans had saved around <strong>$140 billion</strong> and were eager to spend.</li>
          <li><strong>Government spending:</strong> Cold War defence spending kept factories busy. The <strong>Korean War (1951)</strong> was another boost &mdash; military spending accounted for around <strong>10% of GDP</strong> in the 1950s.</li>
          <li><strong>New technology:</strong> Wartime innovations were adapted for peacetime. <strong>Televisions, synthetic materials, jet travel, and plastics</strong> created new industries.</li>
          <li><strong>Population growth:</strong> The &lsquo;baby boom&rsquo; (see below) created huge demand for housing, schools, and consumer goods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n5">Truman&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fair Deal&rsquo;</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n6">After Roosevelt&rsquo;s death in 1945, President <strong>Harry Truman</strong> promised Americans a <strong>&lsquo;Fair Deal.&rsquo;</strong> He said: <em>&lsquo;Every segment of our population has a right to expect from his government a fair deal.&rsquo;</em> Truman&rsquo;s policies continued the New Deal approach &mdash; using government spending to support jobs, housing, and welfare. President <strong>Eisenhower</strong> (1953&ndash;1961) continued many of these programmes too. The idea that government should help ordinary people was now firmly established.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n7">The GI Bill</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">The <strong>Servicemen&rsquo;s Readjustment Act of 1944</strong> (the <strong>GI Bill</strong>) was one of the most important laws in American history. It gave returning veterans:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> The government paid tuition and living costs. By 1947, veterans were <strong>49% of all college admissions</strong>. Nearly <strong>8 million veterans</strong> used this benefit.</li>
          <li><strong>Home loans:</strong> <strong>Low-interest, zero-deposit mortgages</strong> helped millions buy homes, driving suburban growth.</li>
          <li><strong>Unemployment support:</strong> <strong>$20 per week</strong> for up to a year while veterans found work.</li>
        </ul>

        <div data-narration-id="n9" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The GI Bill&rsquo;s Impact</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n10">The GI Bill opened higher education to millions of working-class Americans, creating a larger, more skilled workforce. Before WWII, college was mainly for the wealthy. However, Black veterans often struggled to access benefits &mdash; many colleges (especially in the South) refused to admit them, and banks sometimes refused mortgages to Black applicants in white areas.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n11">The Baby Boom</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">When soldiers returned home, the birth rate soared. Between <strong>1946 and 1964</strong>, about <strong>76 million babies</strong> were born &mdash; the <strong>&lsquo;baby boomers.&rsquo;</strong> The peak year was <strong>1957</strong>, with <strong>4.3 million</strong> births.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n13">The baby boom created huge demand for housing, schools, children&rsquo;s products, and food. It fuelled suburban growth as families needed bigger homes. In the 1960s and 1970s, the baby boomers themselves became a powerful cultural and political force.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n14">Suburbia and Levittown</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">One of the most visible changes was the rapid growth of <strong>suburbs</strong> &mdash; residential communities on the outskirts of cities. They offered affordable homes, gardens, good schools, and a quieter life away from crowded inner cities.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n16">Levittown</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n17">The most famous suburb was <strong>Levittown</strong>, built by <strong>William Levitt</strong> on Long Island, New York, from <strong>1947</strong>. Levitt used <strong>assembly-line techniques</strong> &mdash; each identical house could be built in just <strong>16 minutes</strong> per stage. Houses started at <strong>$7,990</strong> (about $100,000 today). Levittown eventually held <strong>17,000 homes</strong> and <strong>82,000 people</strong>.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n18" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Suburban Growth</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n19">By 1960, <strong>one-third of all Americans</strong> lived in suburbs. Suburban population grew by <strong>47%</strong> in the 1950s. However, the suburbs were overwhelmingly white. Levittown&rsquo;s contracts explicitly <strong>banned sales to African Americans</strong>. This practice, known as <strong>&lsquo;redlining,&rsquo;</strong> trapped Black families in overcrowded inner-city areas with declining services.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n20">Suburban Women&rsquo;s Isolation</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n21">Suburban life was not perfect for everyone. Many women who had worked during the war were now expected to be full-time housewives. Isolated in their suburban homes, unable to work, some women felt <strong>bored, lonely, and depressed</strong>. This sense of frustration would later inspire <strong>Betty Friedan&rsquo;s</strong> feminist movement in the 1960s.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n22">Consumer Culture</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">Post-war America saw a consumer explosion that dwarfed even the 1920s:</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n24">Television</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n25">Television was the defining technology of the era. In <strong>1945</strong>, fewer than <strong>10,000</strong> homes had a TV. By <strong>1960</strong>, <strong>46 million</strong> did &mdash; about <strong>90%</strong> of all homes. TV transformed entertainment, news, advertising, and politics. Adverts beamed into living rooms drove consumer spending.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n26">Car Culture</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n27">The car became central to American life. By the mid-1950s, there were over <strong>60 million cars</strong>. The <strong>Interstate Highway Act of 1956</strong>, signed by President <strong>Eisenhower</strong>, built <strong>41,000 miles</strong> of interstate highways &mdash; the largest public works project in American history. Highways made suburban living practical and spawned new businesses: <strong>drive-in cinemas, drive-in restaurants (including the first McDonald&rsquo;s in 1955), shopping malls, and motels</strong>.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n28">Consumer Goods and Credit</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n29">Advertising, <strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A system of buying goods by paying in regular instalments over time rather than all at once.">hire purchase</dfn></strong> (buying on credit), and rising incomes meant Americans bought more than ever. Hire purchase increased by <strong>800%</strong> between 1945 and 1957. By the late 1950s, the average family owned a <strong>car, television, washing machine, and refrigerator</strong>. America consumed <strong>one-third of the world&rsquo;s goods</strong> despite having only <strong>6%</strong> of the world&rsquo;s population.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n30">Rock and Roll</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n31"><strong>Rock and roll</strong> was the biggest cultural change of the 1950s. It grew out of African American <strong>rhythm and blues</strong> music and became hugely popular with white teenagers.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n32"><strong>Elvis Presley</strong> &mdash; the <strong>&lsquo;King of Rock and Roll&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; became a sensation with hits like <em>Hound Dog</em> and <em>Jailhouse Rock</em>. Other stars included <strong>Chuck Berry</strong>, who helped define the rock and roll guitar sound, and <strong>Buddy Holly</strong>. Their music thrilled young people and horrified many adults.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n33">Rock and roll created a <strong>&lsquo;generation gap&rsquo;</strong> between teenagers and their parents. Adults criticised the music for encouraging rebellion, sexual freedom, and disrespect for authority. For the first time, <strong>teenagers emerged as a distinct group</strong> with their own money, music, fashion, and identity. Businesses quickly targeted this new market. The teenager became a powerful consumer.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n36"><strong>Inner-city poverty:</strong> As white families moved to suburbs (&lsquo;white flight&rsquo;), inner cities lost tax revenue, jobs, and services.

        <p data-narration-id="n40">Show the examiner you understand the <strong>contrast</strong> between the image and reality of post-war America. Many Americans enjoyed huge prosperity, but the benefits were not shared equally. Suburbs were largely <strong>white-only</strong>, African Americans faced ongoing discrimination, and inner cities declined. Strong answers link the boom to the <strong>civil rights movement</strong> &mdash; prosperity made inequality even more visible and unacceptable. Mention rock and roll and the generation gap to show awareness of cultural change.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n42">Conclusion</h2>
        <p data-narration-id="n43">Post-war America was transformed by an economic boom, suburban expansion, and a consumer revolution. The GI Bill created an educated, home-owning middle class. Truman&rsquo;s Fair Deal continued government support for ordinary Americans. Television, cars, and rock and roll defined a new way of life. However, prosperity was not shared by all &mdash; African Americans, inner-city residents, and rural communities were largely excluded. The gap between affluent white suburbia and continued racial inequality would fuel the upheavals of the 1960s.</p>
        <h3 data-narration-id="n44">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Economic superpower:</strong> GNP doubled between 1945 and 1960. Cold War and Korean War defence spending kept the economy booming. Hire purchase rose 800%.</li>
          <li><strong>Suburban revolution:</strong> One-third of Americans lived in suburbs by 1960. Levittown symbolised affordable living, but minorities were excluded and some suburban women felt isolated.</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural change:</strong> Rock and roll created a generation gap. Teenagers emerged as a distinct consumer group. 90% of homes had TV by 1960.</li>

Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which events were problematic.\nExample: One feature was mass-produced affordable housing. The most famous suburb was Levittown, built by William Levitt on Long Island, New York, from 1947. Levitt used assembly-line techniques \u2014 each identical house could be built in just 16 minutes per stage. Houses started at $7,990, and Levittown eventually held 17,000 homes and 82,000 people. By 1960, one-third of all Americans lived in suburbs.\n\nAnother example: Another feature was racial exclusion. Suburban developments like Levittown explicitly banned sales to African Americans through restrictive contracts. This practice, known as \u2018redlining,\u2019 trapped Black families in overcrowded inner-city areas with declining services.

Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which events were problematic.\nExample: One reason was pent-up consumer demand. During the war, consumer goods had been rationed and Americans had saved around $140 billion. After 1945, people were eager to spend on cars, refrigerators, and televisions. Hire purchase (buying on credit) increased by 800% between 1945 and 1957, fuelling a consumer explosion.\n\nAnother example: Another reason was Cold War defence spending. The Korean War (1951) and the arms race with the Soviet Union meant military spending accounted for around 10% of GDP in the 1950s. This kept factories busy producing weapons and military equipment, sustaining employment and economic growth.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: Consumer culture transformed American life in the 1950s, but the changes affected different groups differently. Television was the defining technology \u2014 from fewer than 10,000 homes with TV in 1945 to 46 million (90%) by 1960. TV transformed entertainment, news, and advertising, driving consumer spending through adverts beamed directly into living rooms. Car culture reshaped the physical landscape: over 60 million cars by the mid-1950s and the Interstate Highway Act (1956) built 41,000 miles of highways, spawning drive-in cinemas, the first McDonald\u2019s (1955), shopping malls, and motels. Hire purchase rose 800%, and the average family owned a car, TV, washing machine, and refrigerator. America consumed one-third of the world\u2019s goods with only 6% of the population. However, not everyone benefited. African Americans faced ongoing segregation and were excluded from many suburbs. Inner cities declined as white families moved to suburbs (\u2018white flight\u2019). Rural areas like Appalachia remained in severe poverty. Critics like the Beat Generation\u2019s Jack Kerouac questioned whether consumerism was truly fulfilling.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Television ownership rose from 10,000 to 46 million homes between 1945 and 1960, changing how Americans were entertained and how products were advertised. Car ownership boomed to over 60 million, and the Interstate Highway Act (1956) built 41,000 miles of highways, creating new businesses like drive-ins and shopping malls. However, African Americans and rural communities were largely excluded from this prosperity.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: Television changed American life. By 1960, 90% of homes had a TV, and adverts drove people to buy more consumer goods.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s).

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: The GI Bill (Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act of 1944) was one of the most transformative laws in American history, but its benefits were unequally shared. It provided three key things: education (the government paid tuition and living costs \u2014 by 1947, veterans were 49% of all college admissions, and nearly 8 million used this benefit), home loans (low-interest, zero-deposit mortgages that fuelled suburban growth), and unemployment support ($20 per week for up to a year). The GI Bill opened higher education to millions of working-class Americans for the first time, creating a larger, more skilled workforce and expanding the middle class. The home loan provisions drove the suburban boom \u2014 by 1960, one-third of Americans lived in suburbs. However, African American veterans often could not benefit equally. Racist banks denied them home loans, and white universities (especially in the South) refused to admit them. The suburbs funded by GI Bill loans, like Levittown, explicitly banned sales to Black families. The GI Bill thus widened the racial wealth gap even as it expanded the white middle class.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both were closely connected and together transformed American life. Suburban growth was dramatic \u2014 by 1960, one-third of Americans lived in suburbs, with suburban population growing 47% in the 1950s. Levittown (from 1947) used assembly-line techniques to build affordable homes at $7,990. The GI Bill\u2019s zero-deposit mortgages and Eisenhower\u2019s Interstate Highway Act (1956, 41,000 miles) made suburban living practical. However, suburbs were racially exclusive \u2014 Levittown banned sales to African Americans, trapping Black families in declining inner cities. Many suburban women felt isolated and bored, foreshadowing the feminist movement. Television and consumer culture had an equally transformative impact. TV ownership went from 10,000 to 46 million homes (90%) between 1945 and 1960. Advertising drove consumer spending, and hire purchase rose 800%. Car culture (60 million cars), rock and roll, and the teenager as a consumer group all emerged. America consumed one-third of the world\u2019s goods with 6% of the population. The two bullets are deeply connected: suburbs needed cars and highways; TV advertising drove consumer spending; and both created a conformist, materialist lifestyle that critics like the Beat Generation challenged. Together they defined post-war America, but suburban growth had the more lasting structural impact because it reshaped racial geography and created inequalities that persist today.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): By 1960, one-third of Americans lived in suburbs. Levittown held 17,000 homes. The Interstate Highway Act built 41,000 miles of roads. But suburbs excluded African Americans through redlining.\nExample (bullet 2): TV ownership reached 90% of homes by 1960. Hire purchase rose 800%. Rock and roll created a generation gap. Teenagers became a powerful consumer group.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Suburbs grew rapidly \u2014 Levittown was built from 1947 with houses at $7,990, and by 1960 one-third of Americans lived in suburbs.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s).

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both bullets are closely linked \u2014 teenage culture only emerged because of economic prosperity. Rock and roll was the biggest cultural change of the 1950s. Artists like Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, and Buddy Holly created a new sound that grew from African American rhythm and blues. Rock and roll created a \u2018generation gap\u2019 between teenagers and parents. Adults criticised the music for encouraging rebellion and disrespect. For the first time, teenagers were a distinct group with their own music, fashion, and identity. However, this cultural revolution was only possible because of the economic boom. Rising family incomes (up 30%), the baby boom (76 million births 1946\u20131964), and hire purchase (up 800%) meant teenagers had money to spend. Businesses targeted this new market. The GNP doubled between 1945 and 1960. Wartime factories switched to producing consumer goods. Cold War defence spending (10% of GDP) kept the economy booming. Television (90% of homes by 1960) spread teen culture nationwide. The economic boom had the greater impact because it created the conditions for everything else \u2014 without rising living standards, there would have been no teenage consumer group and no market for rock and roll records.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry created rock and roll, which thrilled teenagers and horrified parents. A \u2018generation gap\u2019 emerged. Teenagers became a distinct consumer group with their own fashion and music.\nExample (bullet 2): The baby boom (76 million births) and rising incomes meant more young people with more money. TV (90% of homes by 1960) and hire purchase (up 800%) made consumer culture available to teenagers.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Rock and roll created a generation gap. Elvis Presley became a sensation, and teenagers developed their own identity separate from their parents.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Young people listened to rock and roll and had more money to spend.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."
