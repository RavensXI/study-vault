        <h2>Segregation and Jim Crow Laws</h2>

        <p>By the 1940s, African Americans &mdash; particularly those living in the <strong>Southern states</strong> &mdash; faced systematic racial discrimination enforced by law. The <dfn class="term" data-def="State and local laws enacted in the Southern United States from the 1870s onwards that enforced racial segregation in all public facilities, including schools, transport, restaurants, and drinking fountains. They were named after a racist minstrel character.">Jim Crow laws</dfn> had been in place since the late 19th century and created a system of <strong>legal segregation</strong> that touched every aspect of daily life.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Jim Crow Segregation</div>
          <p>Jim Crow laws enforced the separation of Black and white Americans in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Schools</strong> &mdash; separate (and usually inferior) schools for Black children</li>
            <li><strong>Transport</strong> &mdash; separate seating on buses, trains, and waiting rooms</li>
            <li><strong>Public facilities</strong> &mdash; separate drinking fountains, restrooms, and parks</li>
            <li><strong>Restaurants and theatres</strong> &mdash; Black people were either barred or forced to sit in designated areas</li>
            <li><strong>Voting</strong> &mdash; literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses were used to prevent Black Americans from voting</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>In 1896, the Supreme Court ruling in <strong>Plessy v. Ferguson</strong> had established the doctrine of <dfn class="term" data-def="The legal doctrine established by the 1896 Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson, which ruled that racial segregation was constitutional as long as the separate facilities provided for Black and white people were of equal quality. In practice, facilities for Black Americans were almost always vastly inferior.">&ldquo;separate but equal,&rdquo;</dfn> declaring that segregation was constitutional as long as facilities for Black and white people were equal. In practice, facilities for Black Americans were almost always <strong>vastly inferior</strong> &mdash; schools were underfunded, hospitals were poorly equipped, and opportunities were severely limited.</p>

        <h3>Violence and Intimidation</h3>

        <p>Segregation was enforced not just by law but by <strong>violence and terror</strong>. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A white supremacist hate group founded in 1865 that used violence, lynching, and intimidation to terrorise Black Americans and prevent them from exercising their rights. The Klan experienced a major revival in the 1920s and continued to operate through the civil rights era.">Ku Klux Klan (KKK)</dfn> terrorised Black communities through lynchings, bombings, and arson. Between 1882 and 1968, over <strong>4,700 people</strong> were lynched in the United States, the vast majority of them Black men. Local police and courts often turned a blind eye to this violence, and perpetrators were rarely punished.</p>

        <h2>The Impact of World War Two</h2>

        <p>The Second World War (1939&ndash;1945) proved to be a turning point for the civil rights movement. The war exposed the hypocrisy of fighting for freedom and democracy abroad while tolerating racial oppression at home.</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>How WW2 changed things for African Americans</span>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Military service:</strong> Over <strong>1 million</strong> African Americans served in the US armed forces during WW2, although they served in <strong>segregated units</strong>. Their bravery and sacrifice strengthened demands for equal treatment at home. The famous <strong>Tuskegee Airmen</strong> &mdash; an all-Black fighter pilot squadron &mdash; distinguished themselves in combat and challenged racist assumptions about Black capability.</p>
              <p><strong>The Double V Campaign:</strong> The <em>Pittsburgh Courier</em>, a leading Black newspaper, launched the <dfn class="term" data-def="A campaign launched by the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper in 1942, calling for African Americans to fight for a double victory: victory against fascism abroad in World War Two, and victory against racism at home in the United States.">&ldquo;Double V&rdquo; campaign</dfn> in 1942, calling for victory against fascism abroad and victory against racism at home.</p>
              <p><strong>Economic opportunities:</strong> The wartime industrial boom drew hundreds of thousands of Black Americans to work in factories in the North and West during the <dfn class="term" data-def="The large-scale migration of over 6 million African Americans from the rural Southern states to cities in the North, Midwest, and West between 1910 and 1970, driven by the search for better economic opportunities and escape from Jim Crow segregation.">Great Migration</dfn>. In 1941, civil rights leader <strong>A. Philip Randolph</strong> threatened a march on Washington to demand fair employment in the defence industry. President Roosevelt responded by signing <strong>Executive Order 8802</strong>, banning racial discrimination in the defence industry &mdash; the first federal action on civil rights since Reconstruction.</p>
              <p><strong>Returning veterans:</strong> After the war, Black veterans returned home expecting the same freedoms they had fought to defend. Instead, they faced the same Jim Crow discrimination. This injustice radicalised many and swelled the ranks of civil rights organisations.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The NAACP and Legal Challenges</h2>

        <p>The <dfn class="term" data-def="The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, founded in 1909. It became the leading civil rights organisation, using legal challenges in the courts to overturn segregation laws. Its Legal Defense Fund, led by Thurgood Marshall, won several landmark Supreme Court cases.">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)</dfn>, founded in 1909, was the leading civil rights organisation of the era. Its strategy was to use the <strong>legal system</strong> to challenge segregation, bringing carefully chosen test cases before the courts to overturn discriminatory laws.</p>

        <p>The NAACP&rsquo;s chief lawyer, <strong>Thurgood Marshall</strong>, led a series of legal victories in the 1940s and 1950s that chipped away at the &ldquo;separate but equal&rdquo; doctrine. Marshall would later become the first African American Supreme Court Justice in 1967.</p>

        <h2>Brown v. Board of Education (1954)</h2>

        <p>The most significant legal victory came on <strong>17 May 1954</strong>, when the Supreme Court delivered its unanimous ruling in <dfn class="term" data-def="A landmark 1954 Supreme Court case in which the court ruled unanimously that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, overturning the 'separate but equal' doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. The case was brought on behalf of Linda Brown, a Black girl denied entry to her local all-white school in Topeka, Kansas.">Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</dfn>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Brown v. Board of Education</div>
          <p>The case was brought by <strong>Oliver Brown</strong> on behalf of his daughter <strong>Linda</strong>, who had been denied entry to her local all-white school in Topeka, Kansas, and was forced to travel a long distance to attend a segregated Black school. Chief Justice <strong>Earl Warren</strong> declared that <em>&ldquo;separate educational facilities are inherently unequal&rdquo;</em> and therefore violated the 14th Amendment. This overturned <strong>Plessy v. Ferguson</strong> after 58 years.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Significance and Limitations</h3>

        <p>The Brown ruling was a <strong>landmark moment</strong> in the civil rights movement. It established the legal principle that segregation was unconstitutional and gave the movement enormous moral and legal ammunition. However, the ruling had serious limitations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Supreme Court set <strong>no deadline</strong> for desegregation, saying only that it should happen &ldquo;with all deliberate speed&rdquo;</li>
          <li>Many Southern states <strong>refused to comply</strong> &mdash; over 100 Southern congressmen signed the &ldquo;Southern Manifesto&rdquo; pledging resistance</li>
          <li>By 1957, <strong>not a single Black child</strong> attended an integrated school in the states of Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, or South Carolina</li>
          <li>The ruling only applied to <strong>schools</strong>, not to other areas of segregation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Little Rock Nine (1957)</h2>

        <p>The fierce resistance to school desegregation was dramatically illustrated in <strong>September 1957</strong> at <dfn class="term" data-def="A high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, which became the centre of a desegregation crisis in 1957 when nine Black students attempted to enrol. Governor Orval Faubus used the Arkansas National Guard to block them, prompting President Eisenhower to send in federal troops to enforce their right to attend.">Central High School</dfn> in Little Rock, Arkansas.</p>

              <p>Nine Black students &mdash; known as the <strong>Little Rock Nine</strong> &mdash; attempted to enrol at the previously all-white Central High School. Arkansas Governor <strong>Orval Faubus</strong> ordered the <strong>Arkansas National Guard</strong> to block their entry, directly defying the federal government.</p>
              <p>When student <strong>Elizabeth Eckford</strong> arrived alone on the first day, she was surrounded by a screaming white mob. Photographs of the 15-year-old girl being harassed and threatened were published around the world, generating <strong>international outrage</strong> and drawing global attention to American racism.</p>
              <p>After weeks of crisis, President <strong>Dwight D. Eisenhower</strong> reluctantly intervened, sending <strong>1,000 soldiers</strong> from the <strong>101st Airborne Division</strong> to escort the nine students into school. It was the first time since Reconstruction that a president had used federal troops to protect the rights of African Americans.</p>
              <p>The nine students endured a full year of <strong>harassment, physical attacks, and verbal abuse</strong> from white students. Despite this, they persevered. Their courage demonstrated both the enormous bravery required to challenge segregation and the depth of white resistance to change.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Significance of Little Rock</div>
          <p>Little Rock showed that: (1) Southern states would use force to resist desegregation; (2) the federal government <em>could</em> be pressured into intervening; and (3) media coverage &mdash; especially television &mdash; was a powerful weapon for the civil rights movement, as images of white hatred shocked moderate Americans and the international community.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955&ndash;1956)</h2>

        <p>While the NAACP fought segregation through the courts, a new form of protest was emerging: <strong>direct action</strong>. The event that catalysed this shift was the Montgomery Bus Boycott.</p>

        <h3>Rosa Parks and the Spark</h3>

        <p>On <strong>1 December 1955</strong>, <dfn class="term" data-def="An African American civil rights activist who, on 1 December 1955, refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama.

Parks was not acting on impulse &mdash; she was an experienced civil rights activist who had attended training at the <strong>Highlander Folk School</strong>, a centre for civil rights education.</p>

        <h3>The Boycott</h3>

        <p>In response to Parks&rsquo;s arrest, Montgomery&rsquo;s Black community launched a <strong>total boycott</strong> of the city&rsquo;s bus system. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A year-long protest (December 1955 to December 1956) during which the Black community of Montgomery, Alabama, refused to use the city's bus system to protest segregated seating.

It ended when the Supreme Court ruled bus segregation unconstitutional.">Montgomery Bus Boycott</dfn> lasted <strong>381 days</strong> &mdash; over a year.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Montgomery Bus Boycott</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Around <strong>40,000</strong> Black commuters found alternative ways to travel &mdash; walking, carpooling, or cycling &mdash; rather than riding segregated buses</li>
            <li>Black passengers made up roughly <strong>75%</strong> of bus riders, so the boycott devastated the bus company financially</li>
            <li>Protesters faced intimidation: <strong>Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s home was bombed</strong>, and many boycotters were arrested or lost their jobs</li>
            <li>On <strong>13 November 1956</strong>, the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Browder v. Gayle</em> that bus segregation was <strong>unconstitutional</strong></li>

          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Emergence of Martin Luther King Jr.</h3>

        <p>The boycott brought a young Baptist minister to national prominence: <strong>Dr Martin Luther King Jr.</strong>, aged just 26, was elected president of the <dfn class="term" data-def="The Montgomery Improvement Association, formed in December 1955 to organise and lead the Montgomery Bus Boycott. It elected the 26-year-old Martin Luther King Jr. as its president, launching his career as a civil rights leader.">Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA)</dfn> to lead the boycott.</p>

        <p>King was inspired by the ideas of <strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong> and advocated <dfn class="term" data-def="A strategy of protesting injustice through peaceful means such as boycotts, sit-ins, and marches, while refusing to use violence even when attacked. Martin Luther King Jr. was the most prominent advocate of this approach in the American civil rights movement.">non-violent direct action</dfn> &mdash; the strategy of confronting injustice through peaceful protest.

        <h2>Eisenhower and Federal Action</h2>

        <p>President Eisenhower was a <strong>reluctant supporter</strong> of civil rights. He privately expressed doubts about the Brown ruling and was slow to act on desegregation. However, the Little Rock crisis forced his hand, and in <strong>1957</strong> he signed the <dfn class="term" data-def="Passed in 1957, this was the first federal civil rights legislation since 1875.

        <p>When discussing the early civil rights movement, examiners want to see that you understand <strong>both the legal and direct-action approaches</strong>. The NAACP focused on winning court cases (like Brown v. Board), while the Montgomery Bus Boycott showed the power of mass protest. A top-level answer will explain how these strategies <strong>complemented each other</strong> &mdash; legal victories provided the moral framework, while direct action created the public pressure needed to enforce change.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1940s and 1950s saw the foundations of the modern civil rights movement being laid. World War Two raised expectations and exposed the hypocrisy of American racism. The NAACP&rsquo;s legal strategy achieved the landmark Brown v. Board ruling, while the Montgomery Bus Boycott demonstrated the power of mass non-violent protest and propelled Martin Luther King Jr. to national leadership. However, progress was painfully slow &mdash; white resistance was fierce, federal support was limited, and the lives of most Black Americans in the South remained shaped by segregation, poverty, and fear. The stage was set for the dramatic confrontations of the 1960s.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Jim Crow laws</strong> enforced legal segregation across the South, creating a system of racial oppression backed by violence and intimidation.</li>
          <li><strong>World War Two</strong> was a catalyst for change, as Black military service and the Double V Campaign strengthened demands for equality.</li>
          <li><strong>Brown v. Board of Education (1954)</strong> was a landmark ruling that declared school segregation unconstitutional, but Southern resistance meant desegregation was painfully slow.</li>
          <li><strong>The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955&ndash;56)</strong> proved that mass non-violent protest could achieve real change and launched MLK as a national leader.</li>
          <li><strong>Little Rock (1957)</strong> showed both the depth of white resistance and the potential for federal intervention when the crisis attracted media attention.</li>
