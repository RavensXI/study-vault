        <h2>The Post-War Economic Boom</h2>

        <p>After World War Two ended in <strong>1945</strong>, the United States entered a period of huge economic growth. Unlike the fragile boom of the 1920s, this one was sustained and widespread. The USA emerged as the world&rsquo;s dominant economic and military superpower. Many Americans felt they were living the <strong><dfn class="term" data-def="The belief that through hard work, anyone in America can achieve prosperity and success, regardless of their background. It became central to American identity in the post-war era.">American Dream</dfn></strong> &mdash; the idea that through hard work, anyone could achieve prosperity and success.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Economic Dominance</div>
          <p>By the late 1940s, the USA produced over <strong>50% of the world&rsquo;s manufactured goods</strong>. The economy grew by <strong>3.5% per year</strong> on average. Between 1945 and 1960, the <strong>gross national product (GNP)</strong> doubled. Unemployment stayed below <strong>5%</strong> for most of the 1950s. Average family income rose by <strong>30%</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Why Did the Economy Boom?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wartime production:</strong> Factories switched from making tanks and aircraft to cars, fridges, and televisions. They were modern, efficient, and ready to meet demand.</li>
          <li><strong>Pent-up demand:</strong> Consumer goods had been rationed during the war. Americans had saved around <strong>$140 billion</strong> and were eager to spend.</li>
          <li><strong>Government spending:</strong> Cold War defence spending kept factories busy. The <strong>Korean War (1951)</strong> was another boost &mdash; military spending accounted for around <strong>10% of GDP</strong> in the 1950s.</li>
          <li><strong>New technology:</strong> Wartime innovations were adapted for peacetime. <strong>Televisions, synthetic materials, jet travel, and plastics</strong> created new industries.</li>
          <li><strong>Population growth:</strong> The &lsquo;baby boom&rsquo; (see below) created huge demand for housing, schools, and consumer goods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Truman&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fair Deal&rsquo;</h3>
        <p>After Roosevelt&rsquo;s death in 1945, President <strong>Harry Truman</strong> promised Americans a <strong>&lsquo;Fair Deal.&rsquo;</strong> He said: <em>&lsquo;Every segment of our population has a right to expect from his government a fair deal.&rsquo;</em> Truman&rsquo;s policies continued the New Deal approach &mdash; using government spending to support jobs, housing, and welfare. President <strong>Eisenhower</strong> (1953&ndash;1961) continued many of these programmes too. The idea that government should help ordinary people was now firmly established.</p>

        <h2>The GI Bill</h2>

        <p>The <strong>Servicemen&rsquo;s Readjustment Act of 1944</strong> (the <strong>GI Bill</strong>) was one of the most important laws in American history. It gave returning veterans:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> The government paid tuition and living costs. By 1947, veterans were <strong>49% of all college admissions</strong>. Nearly <strong>8 million veterans</strong> used this benefit.</li>
          <li><strong>Home loans:</strong> <strong>Low-interest, zero-deposit mortgages</strong> helped millions buy homes, driving suburban growth.</li>
          <li><strong>Unemployment support:</strong> <strong>$20 per week</strong> for up to a year while veterans found work.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The GI Bill&rsquo;s Impact</div>
          <p>The GI Bill opened higher education to millions of working-class Americans, creating a larger, more skilled workforce. Before WWII, college was mainly for the wealthy. However, Black veterans often struggled to access benefits &mdash; many colleges (especially in the South) refused to admit them, and banks sometimes refused mortgages to Black applicants in white areas.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Baby Boom</h2>

        <p>When soldiers returned home, the birth rate soared. Between <strong>1946 and 1964</strong>, about <strong>76 million babies</strong> were born &mdash; the <strong>&lsquo;baby boomers.&rsquo;</strong> The peak year was <strong>1957</strong>, with <strong>4.3 million</strong> births.</p>

        <p>The baby boom created huge demand for housing, schools, children&rsquo;s products, and food. It fuelled suburban growth as families needed bigger homes. In the 1960s and 1970s, the baby boomers themselves became a powerful cultural and political force.</p>

        <h2>Suburbia and Levittown</h2>

        <p>One of the most visible changes was the rapid growth of <strong>suburbs</strong> &mdash; residential communities on the outskirts of cities. They offered affordable homes, gardens, good schools, and a quieter life away from crowded inner cities.</p>

        <h3>Levittown</h3>
        <p>The most famous suburb was <strong>Levittown</strong>, built by <strong>William Levitt</strong> on Long Island, New York, from <strong>1947</strong>. Levitt used <strong>assembly-line techniques</strong> &mdash; each identical house could be built in just <strong>16 minutes</strong> per stage. Houses started at <strong>$7,990</strong> (about $100,000 today). Levittown eventually held <strong>17,000 homes</strong> and <strong>82,000 people</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Suburban Growth</div>
          <p>By 1960, <strong>one-third of all Americans</strong> lived in suburbs. Suburban population grew by <strong>47%</strong> in the 1950s. However, the suburbs were overwhelmingly white. Levittown&rsquo;s contracts explicitly <strong>banned sales to African Americans</strong>. This practice, known as <strong>&lsquo;redlining,&rsquo;</strong> trapped Black families in overcrowded inner-city areas with declining services.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Suburban Women&rsquo;s Isolation</h3>
        <p>Suburban life was not perfect for everyone. Many women who had worked during the war were now expected to be full-time housewives. Isolated in their suburban homes, unable to work, some women felt <strong>bored, lonely, and depressed</strong>. This sense of frustration would later inspire <strong>Betty Friedan&rsquo;s</strong> feminist movement in the 1960s.</p>

        <h2>Consumer Culture</h2>

        <p>Post-war America saw a consumer explosion that dwarfed even the 1920s:</p>

        <h3>Television</h3>
        <p>Television was the defining technology of the era. In <strong>1945</strong>, fewer than <strong>10,000</strong> homes had a TV. By <strong>1960</strong>, <strong>46 million</strong> did &mdash; about <strong>90%</strong> of all homes. TV transformed entertainment, news, advertising, and politics. Adverts beamed into living rooms drove consumer spending.</p>

        <h3>Car Culture</h3>
        <p>The car became central to American life. By the mid-1950s, there were over <strong>60 million cars</strong>. The <strong>Interstate Highway Act of 1956</strong>, signed by President <strong>Eisenhower</strong>, built <strong>41,000 miles</strong> of interstate highways &mdash; the largest public works project in American history. Highways made suburban living practical and spawned new businesses: <strong>drive-in cinemas, drive-in restaurants (including the first McDonald&rsquo;s in 1955), shopping malls, and motels</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Consumer Goods and Credit</h3>
        <p>Advertising, <strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A system of buying goods by paying in regular instalments over time rather than all at once. Also known as credit or buying on the instalment plan.">hire purchase</dfn></strong> (buying on credit), and rising incomes meant Americans bought more than ever. Hire purchase increased by <strong>800%</strong> between 1945 and 1957. By the late 1950s, the average family owned a <strong>car, television, washing machine, and refrigerator</strong>. America consumed <strong>one-third of the world&rsquo;s goods</strong> despite having only <strong>6%</strong> of the world&rsquo;s population.</p>

        <h2>Rock and Roll</h2>

        <p><strong>Rock and roll</strong> was the biggest cultural change of the 1950s. It grew out of African American <strong>rhythm and blues</strong> music and became hugely popular with white teenagers.</p>

        <p><strong>Elvis Presley</strong> &mdash; the <strong>&lsquo;King of Rock and Roll&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; became a sensation with hits like <em>Hound Dog</em> and <em>Jailhouse Rock</em>. Other stars included <strong>Chuck Berry</strong>, who helped define the rock and roll guitar sound, and <strong>Buddy Holly</strong>. Their music thrilled young people and horrified many adults.</p>

        <p>Rock and roll created a <strong>&lsquo;generation gap&rsquo;</strong> between teenagers and their parents. Adults criticised the music for encouraging rebellion, sexual freedom, and disrespect for authority. For the first time, <strong>teenagers emerged as a distinct group</strong> with their own money, music, fashion, and identity. Businesses quickly targeted this new market. The teenager became a powerful consumer.</p>

        <h2>The Limits of Post-War Prosperity</h2>

              <p><strong>African Americans:</strong> Black Americans still faced segregation, especially in the South. They were excluded from many suburbs, faced job discrimination, and lived in poverty at much higher rates. In 1950, average Black family income was <strong>54%</strong> of white family income.</p>
              <p><strong>Inner-city poverty:</strong> As white families moved to suburbs (&lsquo;white flight&rsquo;), inner cities lost tax revenue, jobs, and services. The remaining population &mdash; mainly Black and Hispanic &mdash; faced declining schools, rising crime, and crumbling infrastructure.</p>
              <p><strong>Rural poverty:</strong> In areas like <strong>Appalachia</strong> and the Deep South, millions lived in severe poverty without proper healthcare, education, or housing.</p>
              <p><strong>Conformity and discontent:</strong> Suburban life was criticised for its <strong>conformity</strong> and materialism. Writers like <strong>Jack Kerouac</strong> (the Beat Generation) questioned whether the &lsquo;American Dream&rsquo; was truly fulfilling or just shallow consumerism.</p>

        <p>Show the examiner you understand the <strong>contrast</strong> between the image and reality of post-war America. Many Americans enjoyed huge prosperity, but the benefits were not shared equally. Suburbs were largely <strong>white-only</strong>, African Americans faced ongoing discrimination, and inner cities declined. Strong answers link the boom to the <strong>civil rights movement</strong> &mdash; prosperity made inequality even more visible and unacceptable. Mention rock and roll and the generation gap to show awareness of cultural change.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Post-war America was transformed by an economic boom, suburban expansion, and a consumer revolution. The GI Bill created an educated, home-owning middle class. Truman&rsquo;s Fair Deal continued government support for ordinary Americans. Television, cars, and rock and roll defined a new way of life. However, prosperity was not shared by all &mdash; African Americans, inner-city residents, and rural communities were largely excluded. The gap between affluent white suburbia and continued racial inequality would fuel the upheavals of the 1960s.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Economic superpower:</strong> GNP doubled between 1945 and 1960. Cold War and Korean War defence spending kept the economy booming. Hire purchase rose 800%.</li>
          <li><strong>Suburban revolution:</strong> One-third of Americans lived in suburbs by 1960. Levittown symbolised affordable living, but minorities were excluded and some suburban women felt isolated.</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural change:</strong> Rock and roll created a generation gap. Teenagers emerged as a distinct consumer group. 90% of homes had TV by 1960.</li>
