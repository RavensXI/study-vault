        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">The Scale of the Depression</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The <strong>Great Depression</strong> was the worst economic crisis in American history, lasting from 1929 to the late 1930s. After the Wall Street Crash, the economy went into a devastating downward spiral. Businesses closed, banks failed, and millions lost their jobs, homes, and savings.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">Many ordinary Americans who had never bought shares still lost everything. Banks had been gambling with their customers&rsquo; deposits on the stock market. When the market crashed, the banks collapsed &mdash; and innocent savers&rsquo; money went with them. There was no government insurance to protect deposits.</p>

        <figure data-narration-id="n4" class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_depression_statistics.png" alt="Infographic showing six key statistics of the Great Depression by 1933: 13 million unemployed, industrial production down 45%, farm income dropped from $6 billion to $2 billion, 5,000 bank failures, average income fell 40%, and 2 million homeless in Hoovervilles">
        </figure>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n5">Unemployment and Poverty</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">Mass unemployment was the most devastating effect. With no welfare system, no unemployment insurance, and no safety net, losing your job meant losing everything.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">The Human Cost</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n40">
          <li>By 1933, <strong>one in four workers</strong> was unemployed. In some cities it was far worse &mdash; <strong>80%</strong> in <strong>Toledo, Ohio</strong> and <strong>50%</strong> in <strong>Cleveland</strong>.</li>
          <li>Those who kept jobs saw wages cut by an average of <strong>60%</strong> between 1929 and 1933.</li>
          <li><strong>250,000 families</strong> had their homes repossessed in 1932 alone.</li>
          <li>Millions went hungry. Breadlines and soup kitchens appeared in every major city, run by charities &mdash; not the government.</li>
          <li>Suicide rates rose by <strong>30%</strong> between 1929 and 1932.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n8">Hoovervilles</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">Homeless Americans built makeshift shelters on waste ground, in parks, and on town edges. These shanty towns were called <strong>&lsquo;Hoovervilles&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; a bitter, mocking reference to President <strong>Herbert Hoover</strong>, whom many blamed for the crisis.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n10" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Hoovervilles</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n11">Hoovervilles were built from scrap wood, tin, cardboard, and old car parts. The largest, in <strong>Central Park, New York</strong>, housed hundreds. Others appeared in <strong>Seattle, Washington D.C., St Louis</strong>, and most major cities. Bitter nicknames spread: newspapers as blankets were <strong>&lsquo;Hoover blankets,&rsquo;</strong> empty pockets turned out were <strong>&lsquo;Hoover flags,&rsquo;</strong> and broken cars pulled by horses were <strong>&lsquo;Hoover wagons.&rsquo;</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n12">President Hoover&rsquo;s Response</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n13"><strong>Herbert Hoover</strong> was President when the Crash struck. He kept insisting recovery was near, famously declaring <strong>&ldquo;Prosperity is just around the corner.&rdquo;</strong> To millions of starving Americans, this showed how out of touch he was.</p>

        <ul data-narration-id="n41">
          <li>Hoover believed in <strong>&lsquo;rugged individualism&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; the idea that Americans should help themselves, not rely on government handouts. He feared direct relief would make people dependent.</li>
          <li>He encouraged <strong>voluntary action</strong> &mdash; asking businesses not to cut wages and urging charities to help the poor. This was nowhere near enough.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1931</strong>, he invested <strong>$400 million</strong> in government building projects, including the <strong>Hoover Dam</strong>, to try to create jobs. This helped, but it was too small for the scale of the crisis.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1932</strong>, he set up the <strong>Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC)</strong>, making <strong>$1,500 million</strong> available in loans to banks and businesses. Critics called this &ldquo;feeding the sparrows by feeding the horse&rdquo; &mdash; it helped the rich while ordinary people starved.</li>
          <li>He raised tariffs with the <strong>Hawley-Smoot Tariff</strong> (1930), which actually <strong>worsened</strong> the Depression by cutting international trade as other countries retaliated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n14">The Bonus Army, 1932</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">In summer <strong>1932</strong>, about <strong>20,000 World War One veterans</strong> and their families marched on Washington D.C. They demanded early payment of a war service <strong>bonus</strong> not due until 1945. These desperate, unemployed veterans set up camp near the Capitol and called themselves the <strong>Bonus Expeditionary Force</strong> (or <strong>Bonus Army</strong>).</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n16" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Bonus Army Incident</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n17">The Senate rejected the bonus bill, but most veterans refused to leave. Hoover ordered the <strong>US Army</strong>, led by General <strong>Douglas MacArthur</strong>, to clear the camp. Soldiers used <strong>tear gas, bayonets, and tanks</strong> to drive out the veterans and their families, burning their shelters. Two veterans were killed and over <strong>1,000 injured</strong>, including women and children. An <strong>11-month-old baby</strong> died in the attack. The sight of the Army attacking its own war heroes horrified the nation and destroyed Hoover&rsquo;s reputation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n18">The Dust Bowl</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">While the Depression devastated cities, a separate catastrophe struck rural America. The <strong>Dust Bowl</strong> was an ecological disaster affecting the <strong>Great Plains</strong> &mdash; <strong>Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico</strong> &mdash; throughout the 1930s.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n20">Causes of the Dust Bowl</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n42">
          <li><strong>Over-farming:</strong> During WWI and the 1920s, farmers ploughed up vast grasslands to plant wheat and cotton, stripping the soil&rsquo;s protective covering.</li>
          <li><strong>Drought:</strong> A severe drought hit from 1931, lasting most of the decade. The exposed topsoil dried out completely.</li>
          <li><strong>Dust storms:</strong> Huge windstorms picked up loose topsoil, creating &lsquo;black blizzards&rsquo; that travelled hundreds of miles. On <strong>&lsquo;Black Sunday&rsquo; (14 April 1935)</strong>, dust storms turned day into night.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n21">Impact on Farmers</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n22">The Dust Bowl destroyed farming across a vast area. Crops failed, livestock died, and the land became useless. About <strong>2.5 million people</strong> left the Dust Bowl states. Many headed to <strong>California</strong>, where they were called <strong>&lsquo;Okies.&rsquo;</strong> They found only low-paid seasonal work and faced hostility from locals.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n23" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Scale of the Dust Bowl</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n24">At its peak, the Dust Bowl affected <strong>100 million acres</strong>. Dust storms reached as far as <strong>New York and Washington D.C.</strong>, dropping Great Plains soil on politicians&rsquo; desks. The disaster showed how environmental mismanagement could worsen an economic crisis.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n26"><strong>African Americans:</strong> Already the poorest group, they were hit hardest. &lsquo;Last hired, first fired&rsquo; &mdash; Black unemployment reached <strong>50%</strong> in many cities, double the national average. In the South, Black sharecroppers were evicted as farm income collapsed. Racial violence continued with no government help for Black communities.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n27"><strong>Hispanic Americans:</strong> Many Mexican Americans were forced out through <strong>&lsquo;repatriation.&rsquo;</strong> An estimated <strong>500,000&ndash;1 million</strong> people of Mexican descent (including US citizens) were deported or pressured to leave between 1929 and 1936.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n28"><strong>Women:</strong> Working women were accused of &lsquo;stealing&rsquo; men&rsquo;s jobs. Some states banned married women from government jobs. However, some women found work in service roles that men refused.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n29"><strong>Children:</strong> Many were pulled out of school to work or beg. In some mining towns, <strong>90% of children</strong> were malnourished. Thousands of teenagers became <strong>&lsquo;hobos,&rsquo;</strong> riding freight trains looking for work.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n30"><strong>Farmers:</strong> Falling prices, bank foreclosures, and the Dust Bowl devastated farming communities. Thousands lost farms that had been in their families for generations.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n31">The 1932 Election</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n32">By 1932, Americans had had enough of Hoover. The Democratic candidate, <strong>Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR)</strong>, promised a <strong>&ldquo;New Deal&rdquo;</strong> for the American people. He pledged the <strong>&ldquo;Three Rs&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; <strong>Relief</strong> for the poor, <strong>Recovery</strong> for the economy, and <strong>Reform</strong> to prevent another depression.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n33">Roosevelt won in a <strong>landslide</strong>, carrying <strong>42 out of 48 states</strong>. Americans had rejected Hoover&rsquo;s rugged individualism and voted for a president who promised the government would act. The stage was set for a dramatic change of direction.</p>

Discuss <strong>urban workers, farmers, African Americans, and women</strong> separately with specific evidence. Hoover&rsquo;s failures &mdash; &ldquo;Prosperity is just around the corner,&rdquo; the Bonus Army, and his late, inadequate RFC &mdash; explain why Americans voted for Roosevelt&rsquo;s New Deal in 1932.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n37">Conclusion</h2>
        <p data-narration-id="n38">The Great Depression was a catastrophe. By 1933, 13 million were unemployed, 5,000 banks had failed, and millions had lost homes and savings &mdash; including innocent savers whose banks had gambled their money away. Hoovervilles filled the cities, dust storms swept the Plains, and Hoover&rsquo;s &lsquo;rugged individualism&rsquo; left him unable to help. The Bonus Army disaster destroyed his reputation. In 1932, Roosevelt won 42 out of 48 states, promising a New Deal of Relief, Recovery, and Reform.</p>
        <h3 data-narration-id="n39">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n43">
          <li><strong>Mass suffering:</strong> 13 million unemployed by 1933 (25%), no welfare system, and innocent savers wiped out by reckless banks.</li>
          <li><strong>Hoover failed:</strong> His &ldquo;rugged individualism,&rdquo; the Bonus Army attack, and the late RFC ($1,500 million) were not enough. His $400 million building projects barely scratched the surface.</li>
          <li><strong>The Dust Bowl:</strong> An ecological disaster displacing 2.5 million people, compounding the economic crisis.</li>

Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which events were problematic.\nExample: One problem was mass unemployment. By 1933, 13 million Americans (one in four workers) were unemployed. In some cities it was far worse \u2014 80% in Toledo, Ohio. With no welfare system or unemployment insurance, losing a job meant losing everything. Families were evicted, went hungry, and relied on charity breadlines.\n\nAnother example: Another problem was homelessness. 250,000 families had their homes repossessed in 1932 alone. Homeless Americans built shanty towns called \u2018Hoovervilles\u2019 from scrap wood and cardboard.

About 2.5 million people left the Dust Bowl states as crops failed and land became useless. Many headed to California, where they were called \u2018Okies\u2019 and found only low-paid seasonal work and hostility from locals.\n\nAnother example: Another effect was ecological devastation. Over-farming had stripped the soil\u2019s protective covering, and severe drought from 1931 turned the topsoil to dust. Huge \u2018black blizzards\u2019 swept across the Great Plains.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: The Depression affected different groups in different ways and worsened over time. By 1933, 13 million were unemployed and wages had fallen 60%. African Americans were hit hardest \u2014 \u2018last hired, first fired\u2019 meant Black unemployment reached 50% in many cities, double the national average. Hispanic Americans faced forced \u2018repatriation\u2019 \u2014 500,000\u20131 million people of Mexican descent were deported or pressured to leave. Women who worked were accused of stealing men\u2019s jobs. Meanwhile, 250,000 families lost their homes in 1932 alone, and Hoovervilles sprang up in every major city. The Depression did not hit everyone equally \u2014 it deepened existing inequalities.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Mass unemployment devastated families. By 1933, one in four workers was jobless, and those who kept jobs saw wages cut by 60%. With no welfare system, people relied on charity breadlines. Separately, the Dust Bowl destroyed farming across the Great Plains, displacing 2.5 million people who headed west looking for work.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: Many people lost their jobs during the Depression. By 1933, 13 million were unemployed and had to rely on soup kitchens.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s).

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: Farmers were hit by a double crisis. The Depression caused farm prices to collapse \u2014 farm income fell from $6 billion to $2 billion. Banks foreclosed on thousands of farms that had been in families for generations. On top of this, the Dust Bowl struck the Great Plains from 1931. Over-farming during WWI and the 1920s had stripped the soil\u2019s protective covering, and when severe drought hit, huge dust storms destroyed crops and killed livestock. About 2.5 million people left the Dust Bowl states. Those who headed to California (\u2018Okies\u2019) found only low-paid seasonal work and hostility. The economic and ecological disasters reinforced each other \u2014 falling prices made it impossible to invest in the land, while dust storms made farming impossible.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: The Depression caused farm prices to collapse, so farmers could not repay loans and banks foreclosed. Separately, the Dust Bowl destroyed 100 million acres of farmland as dust storms swept across Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico, forcing 2.5 million people to leave.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Unemployment and poverty caused the most immediate suffering \u2014 13 million jobless, 5,000 bank failures wiping out innocent savers\u2019 deposits, 250,000 homes repossessed in 1932, and suicide rates up 30%. However, Hoover\u2019s response made things worse. His belief in \u2018rugged individualism\u2019 meant he refused direct relief, insisting \u2018Prosperity is just around the corner.\u2019 His late measures \u2014 $400 million in building projects and the RFC ($1,500 million in loans to banks) \u2014 helped the wealthy, not ordinary people. The Hawley-Smoot Tariff actually worsened the Depression by cutting international trade. Most damagingly, the Bonus Army incident \u2014 soldiers with tear gas and tanks attacking 20,000 desperate veterans, killing two and injuring over 1,000 \u2014 showed how out of touch Hoover was. Both bullets are connected: the scale of unemployment and poverty demanded a strong government response, and Hoover\u2019s failure to provide one deepened the crisis and led directly to Roosevelt\u2019s landslide in 1932.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): By 1933, one in four workers was unemployed. Hoovervilles appeared in every major city. African Americans were hit hardest \u2014 50% unemployment in many cities.\nExample (bullet 2): Hoover\u2019s RFC only helped banks and big business, not ordinary people. The Bonus Army attack horrified the nation.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Unemployment meant millions of people had no money and had to rely on soup kitchens and breadlines.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s).

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both had devastating effects, but on different groups. The Dust Bowl affected 100 million acres of farmland across Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico. Over-farming and drought created \u2018black blizzards\u2019 that destroyed crops and made land useless, displacing 2.5 million people. \u2018Okies\u2019 who migrated to California faced hostility and low-paid seasonal work. However, urban unemployment affected far more people overall. By 1933, 13 million workers were jobless. Cities like Toledo (80% unemployment) and Cleveland (50%) were devastated. 5,000 banks collapsed, wiping out savings. Hoovervilles filled urban areas, and 250,000 families lost their homes in 1932 alone. Different groups suffered differently \u2014 African Americans faced 50% unemployment (\u2018last hired, first fired\u2019), and 500,000\u20131 million Hispanic Americans were deported through \u2018repatriation.\u2019 While the Dust Bowl was catastrophic for farming communities, urban unemployment affected a larger proportion of the population and drove the political change that brought Roosevelt to power in 1932.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): The Dust Bowl destroyed farming across the Great Plains. Dust storms like \u2018Black Sunday\u2019 (14 April 1935) turned day into night, and 2.5 million people were displaced.\nExample (bullet 2): Urban unemployment reached 25% nationally by 1933. Breadlines and soup kitchens appeared everywhere. Thousands of teenage \u2018hobos\u2019 rode freight trains looking for work.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s).
