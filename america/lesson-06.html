        <h2>The Scale of the Depression</h2>

        <p>The <strong>Great Depression</strong> was the worst economic crisis in American history, lasting from 1929 to the late 1930s. After the Wall Street Crash, the economy went into a devastating downward spiral. Businesses closed, banks failed, and millions lost their jobs, homes, and savings.</p>

        <p>Many ordinary Americans who had never bought shares still lost everything. Banks had been gambling with their customers&rsquo; deposits on the stock market. When the market crashed, the banks collapsed &mdash; and innocent savers&rsquo; money went with them. There was no government insurance to protect deposits.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Depression in Numbers</div>
          <p>By <strong>1933</strong>, around <strong>13 million Americans</strong> were unemployed (<strong>25%</strong> of the workforce). Industrial production had fallen nearly <strong>50%</strong>. Over <strong>5,000 banks</strong> had collapsed. National income dropped from <strong>$87 billion</strong> (1929) to <strong>$40 billion</strong> (1933). Around <strong>1&ndash;2 million</strong> were homeless.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Unemployment and Poverty</h2>

        <p>Mass unemployment was the most devastating effect. With no welfare system, no unemployment insurance, and no safety net, losing your job meant losing everything.</p>

        <h3>The Human Cost</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>By 1933, <strong>one in four workers</strong> was unemployed. In some cities it was far worse &mdash; <strong>80%</strong> in <strong>Toledo, Ohio</strong> and <strong>50%</strong> in <strong>Cleveland</strong>.</li>
          <li>Those who kept jobs saw wages cut by an average of <strong>60%</strong> between 1929 and 1933.</li>
          <li><strong>250,000 families</strong> had their homes repossessed in 1932 alone.</li>
          <li>Millions went hungry. Breadlines and soup kitchens appeared in every major city, run by charities &mdash; not the government.</li>
          <li>Suicide rates rose by <strong>30%</strong> between 1929 and 1932.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hoovervilles</h2>

        <p>Homeless Americans built makeshift shelters on waste ground, in parks, and on town edges. These shanty towns were called <strong>&lsquo;Hoovervilles&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; a bitter, mocking reference to President <strong>Herbert Hoover</strong>, whom many blamed for the crisis.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Hoovervilles</div>
          <p>Hoovervilles were built from scrap wood, tin, cardboard, and old car parts. The largest, in <strong>Central Park, New York</strong>, housed hundreds. Others appeared in <strong>Seattle, Washington D.C., St Louis</strong>, and most major cities. Bitter nicknames spread: newspapers as blankets were <strong>&lsquo;Hoover blankets,&rsquo;</strong> empty pockets turned out were <strong>&lsquo;Hoover flags,&rsquo;</strong> and broken cars pulled by horses were <strong>&lsquo;Hoover wagons.&rsquo;</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h2>President Hoover&rsquo;s Response</h2>

        <p><strong>Herbert Hoover</strong> was President when the Crash struck. He kept insisting recovery was near, famously declaring <strong>&ldquo;Prosperity is just around the corner.&rdquo;</strong> To millions of starving Americans, this showed how out of touch he was.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Hoover believed in <strong>&lsquo;rugged individualism&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; the idea that Americans should help themselves, not rely on government handouts. He feared direct relief would make people dependent.</li>
          <li>He encouraged <strong>voluntary action</strong> &mdash; asking businesses not to cut wages and urging charities to help the poor. This was nowhere near enough.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1931</strong>, he invested <strong>$400 million</strong> in government building projects, including the <strong>Hoover Dam</strong>, to try to create jobs. This helped, but it was too small for the scale of the crisis.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1932</strong>, he set up the <strong>Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC)</strong>, making <strong>$1,500 million</strong> available in loans to banks and businesses. Critics called this &ldquo;feeding the sparrows by feeding the horse&rdquo; &mdash; it helped the rich while ordinary people starved.</li>
          <li>He raised tariffs with the <strong>Hawley-Smoot Tariff</strong> (1930), which actually <strong>worsened</strong> the Depression by cutting international trade as other countries retaliated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bonus Army, 1932</h2>

        <p>In summer <strong>1932</strong>, about <strong>20,000 World War One veterans</strong> and their families marched on Washington D.C. They demanded early payment of a war service <strong>bonus</strong> not due until 1945. These desperate, unemployed veterans set up camp near the Capitol and called themselves the <strong>Bonus Expeditionary Force</strong> (or <strong>Bonus Army</strong>).</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Bonus Army Incident</div>
          <p>The Senate rejected the bonus bill, but most veterans refused to leave. Hoover ordered the <strong>US Army</strong>, led by General <strong>Douglas MacArthur</strong>, to clear the camp. Soldiers used <strong>tear gas, bayonets, and tanks</strong> to drive out the veterans and their families, burning their shelters. Two veterans were killed and over <strong>1,000 injured</strong>, including women and children. An <strong>11-month-old baby</strong> died in the attack. The sight of the Army attacking its own war heroes horrified the nation and destroyed Hoover&rsquo;s reputation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Dust Bowl</h2>

        <p>While the Depression devastated cities, a separate catastrophe struck rural America. The <strong>Dust Bowl</strong> was an ecological disaster affecting the <strong>Great Plains</strong> &mdash; <strong>Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico</strong> &mdash; throughout the 1930s.</p>

        <h3>Causes of the Dust Bowl</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Over-farming:</strong> During WWI and the 1920s, farmers ploughed up vast grasslands to plant wheat and cotton, stripping the soil&rsquo;s protective covering.</li>
          <li><strong>Drought:</strong> A severe drought hit from 1931, lasting most of the decade. The exposed topsoil dried out completely.</li>
          <li><strong>Dust storms:</strong> Huge windstorms picked up loose topsoil, creating &lsquo;black blizzards&rsquo; that travelled hundreds of miles. On <strong>&lsquo;Black Sunday&rsquo; (14 April 1935)</strong>, dust storms turned day into night.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact on Farmers</h3>
        <p>The Dust Bowl destroyed farming across a vast area. Crops failed, livestock died, and the land became useless. About <strong>2.5 million people</strong> left the Dust Bowl states. Many headed to <strong>California</strong>, where they were called <strong>&lsquo;Okies.&rsquo;</strong> They found only low-paid seasonal work and faced hostility from locals.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Scale of the Dust Bowl</div>
          <p>At its peak, the Dust Bowl affected <strong>100 million acres</strong>. Dust storms reached as far as <strong>New York and Washington D.C.</strong>, dropping Great Plains soil on politicians&rsquo; desks. The disaster showed how environmental mismanagement could worsen an economic crisis.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Different Groups</h2>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>African Americans:</strong> Already the poorest group, they were hit hardest. &lsquo;Last hired, first fired&rsquo; &mdash; Black unemployment reached <strong>50%</strong> in many cities, double the national average. In the South, Black sharecroppers were evicted as farm income collapsed. Racial violence continued with no government help for Black communities.</p>
              <p><strong>Hispanic Americans:</strong> Many Mexican Americans were forced out through <strong>&lsquo;repatriation.&rsquo;</strong> An estimated <strong>500,000&ndash;1 million</strong> people of Mexican descent (including US citizens) were deported or pressured to leave between 1929 and 1936.</p>
              <p><strong>Women:</strong> Working women were accused of &lsquo;stealing&rsquo; men&rsquo;s jobs. Some states banned married women from government jobs. However, some women found work in service roles that men refused.</p>
              <p><strong>Children:</strong> Many were pulled out of school to work or beg. In some mining towns, <strong>90% of children</strong> were malnourished. Thousands of teenagers became <strong>&lsquo;hobos,&rsquo;</strong> riding freight trains looking for work.</p>
              <p><strong>Farmers:</strong> Falling prices, bank foreclosures, and the Dust Bowl devastated farming communities. Thousands lost farms that had been in their families for generations.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The 1932 Election</h2>

        <p>By 1932, Americans had had enough of Hoover. The Democratic candidate, <strong>Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR)</strong>, promised a <strong>&ldquo;New Deal&rdquo;</strong> for the American people. He pledged the <strong>&ldquo;Three Rs&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; <strong>Relief</strong> for the poor, <strong>Recovery</strong> for the economy, and <strong>Reform</strong> to prevent another depression.</p>

        <p>Roosevelt won in a <strong>landslide</strong>, carrying <strong>42 out of 48 states</strong>. Americans had rejected Hoover&rsquo;s rugged individualism and voted for a president who promised the government would act. The stage was set for a dramatic change of direction.</p>

        <p>Questions often ask about the <strong>impact on different groups</strong>. Discuss <strong>urban workers, farmers, African Americans, and women</strong> separately with specific evidence. Hoover&rsquo;s failures &mdash; &ldquo;Prosperity is just around the corner,&rdquo; the Bonus Army, and his late, inadequate RFC &mdash; explain why Americans voted for Roosevelt&rsquo;s New Deal in 1932.</p>

      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Great Depression was a catastrophe. By 1933, 13 million were unemployed, 5,000 banks had failed, and millions had lost homes and savings &mdash; including innocent savers whose banks had gambled their money away. Hoovervilles filled the cities, dust storms swept the Plains, and Hoover&rsquo;s &lsquo;rugged individualism&rsquo; left him unable to help. The Bonus Army disaster destroyed his reputation. In 1932, Roosevelt won 42 out of 48 states, promising a New Deal of Relief, Recovery, and Reform.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mass suffering:</strong> 13 million unemployed by 1933 (25%), no welfare system, and innocent savers wiped out by reckless banks.</li>
          <li><strong>Hoover failed:</strong> His &ldquo;rugged individualism,&rdquo; the Bonus Army attack, and the late RFC ($1,500 million) were not enough. His $400 million building projects barely scratched the surface.</li>
          <li><strong>The Dust Bowl:</strong> An ecological disaster displacing 2.5 million people, compounding the economic crisis.</li>
        </ul>
