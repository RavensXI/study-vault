        <h2>FDR&rsquo;s Election in 1932</h2>

        <p><strong>Franklin Delano Roosevelt</strong> (known as FDR) won the <strong>1932 presidential election</strong> in a landslide, defeating the unpopular Herbert Hoover. Roosevelt won <strong>42 of 48 states</strong> and received <strong>57%</strong> of the popular vote. Americans were desperate for change, and Roosevelt promised them a <strong>&lsquo;New Deal&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; a programme of government action to tackle the Depression.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Roosevelt&rsquo;s Promise</div>
          <p>In his acceptance speech, Roosevelt declared: <em>&lsquo;I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people.&rsquo;</em> In his inauguration speech on <strong>4 March 1933</strong>, he famously said: <em>&lsquo;The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&rsquo;</em> Roosevelt projected confidence and energy &mdash; a dramatic contrast with Hoover&rsquo;s perceived inaction.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Roosevelt&rsquo;s Approach</h3>
        <p>FDR&rsquo;s approach was fundamentally different from Hoover&rsquo;s. He believed the federal government had a <strong>responsibility to help</strong> ordinary Americans in crisis. His New Deal had three main aims, known as the <strong>&lsquo;Three Rs&rsquo;</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Relief:</strong> Immediate help for the unemployed, hungry, and homeless.</li>
          <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Getting the economy moving again by creating jobs and boosting spending.</li>
          <li><strong>Reform:</strong> Changing laws and institutions to prevent another depression from happening.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The First Hundred Days (March&ndash;June 1933)</h2>

        <p>Roosevelt acted with extraordinary speed. In his first <strong>100 days</strong> in office, he pushed <strong>15 major pieces of legislation</strong> through Congress. He also used <strong>&lsquo;fireside chats&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; radio broadcasts to the nation &mdash; to explain his policies directly to the American people in simple, reassuring language. Around <strong>60 million Americans</strong> listened to these broadcasts.</p>

        <h3>The Emergency Banking Act (March 1933)</h3>
        <p>Roosevelt&rsquo;s first act was to declare a <strong>&lsquo;bank holiday&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; closing all banks for four days. Government inspectors examined every bank&rsquo;s accounts. Only those judged to be financially sound were allowed to reopen. This restored public confidence in the banking system, and within weeks Americans were depositing money back into banks rather than hiding it at home.</p>

        <h2>The Alphabet Agencies</h2>

        <p>The New Deal created a vast number of new government agencies to tackle different aspects of the Depression. These became known as the <strong>&lsquo;alphabet agencies&rsquo;</strong> because of their abbreviations:</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Key alphabet agencies in detail</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>CCC &mdash; Civilian Conservation Corps (1933):</strong> Provided work for young unemployed men aged 18&ndash;25 in conservation projects &mdash; planting trees, building roads, and preventing soil erosion. Workers received <strong>$30 per month</strong> (of which $25 was sent home to their families). By 1942, around <strong>3 million</strong> young men had worked in the CCC. It planted over <strong>3 billion trees</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>AAA &mdash; Agricultural Adjustment Administration (1933):</strong> Aimed to raise farm prices by <strong>paying farmers to produce less</strong>. By reducing supply, the AAA helped push crop prices up. Farm income doubled between 1933 and 1939. However, the policy was controversial &mdash; critics argued it was wrong to destroy food when millions were going hungry, and it hurt sharecroppers and tenant farmers who were evicted when landowners took land out of production.</p>
              <p><strong>TVA &mdash; Tennessee Valley Authority (1933):</strong> A massive government project to develop the <strong>Tennessee Valley</strong>, one of the poorest regions in America. The TVA built <strong>21 dams</strong> to control flooding, generate cheap hydroelectric power, and improve navigation. It brought electricity to rural areas for the first time, created thousands of jobs, and transformed the region&rsquo;s economy. The TVA is often considered the <strong>most successful</strong> New Deal programme.</p>
              <p><strong>NRA &mdash; National Recovery Administration (1933):</strong> Aimed to improve working conditions and boost industrial recovery. It set <strong>minimum wages, maximum working hours</strong>, and banned child labour. Businesses that signed up could display the <strong>&lsquo;Blue Eagle&rsquo;</strong> symbol to show they were doing their part. However, the NRA was declared <strong>unconstitutional</strong> by the Supreme Court in 1935 because it gave the federal government too much power over businesses.</p>
              <p><strong>FERA &mdash; Federal Emergency Relief Administration (1933):</strong> Provided <strong>$500 million</strong> in grants to states for direct relief &mdash; food, clothing, and shelter for the unemployed. This was the first time the federal government had given money directly to help the poor.</p>
              <p><strong>PWA &mdash; Public Works Administration (1933):</strong> Funded large-scale construction projects to create jobs and boost the economy. It built schools, hospitals, bridges, dams, and airports. The PWA spent over <strong>$6 billion</strong> and built <strong>34,000 projects</strong>, including the <strong>Triborough Bridge</strong> in New York.</p>
              <p><strong>WPA &mdash; Works Progress Administration (1935):</strong> The largest New Deal agency, the WPA employed around <strong>8.5 million people</strong> between 1935 and 1943. It built <strong>650,000 miles of roads, 125,000 public buildings, and 8,000 parks</strong>. Uniquely, it also employed artists, writers, actors, and musicians, funding cultural projects alongside construction.</p>

        <h2>The Second New Deal (1935&ndash;1937)</h2>

        <p>In 1935, Roosevelt launched a <strong>second wave</strong> of New Deal legislation, focusing more on long-term reform and social welfare:</p>

        <h3>The Social Security Act (1935)</h3>
        <p>This was arguably the most important and lasting reform of the New Deal. It established:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A national <strong>pension system</strong> for Americans over 65</li>
          <li><strong>Unemployment insurance</strong> &mdash; for the first time, workers who lost their jobs would receive temporary financial support</li>
          <li>Financial help for the <strong>disabled</strong> and for <strong>mothers with dependent children</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Social Security Act created America&rsquo;s first <strong>welfare state</strong>. It established the principle that the federal government had a responsibility to care for its citizens &mdash; a revolutionary idea in the United States.</p>

        <h3>The Wagner Act (1935)</h3>
        <p>Also known as the <strong>National Labor Relations Act</strong>, this gave workers the legal right to <strong>join trade unions</strong> and to <strong>bargain collectively</strong> with their employers. It set up the <strong>National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)</strong> to protect workers&rsquo; rights. Union membership grew from <strong>3.7 million</strong> in 1933 to <strong>9 million</strong> by 1938.</p>

        <h2>Opposition to the New Deal</h2>

        <p>Despite its popularity, the New Deal faced significant opposition from multiple directions:</p>

        <h3>Opposition from the Right (Republicans and Big Business)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Republicans and business leaders accused Roosevelt of <strong>spending too much</strong> government money and creating a dangerous level of federal power.</li>
          <li>They called the New Deal <strong>&lsquo;socialism&rsquo;</strong> or even &lsquo;communism,&rsquo; arguing it interfered with free enterprise and individual liberty.</li>
          <li>The <strong>American Liberty League</strong>, funded by wealthy businessmen, campaigned against the New Deal.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Opposition from the Left</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Huey Long</strong>, the populist Senator from Louisiana, argued the New Deal did not go far enough. He proposed a <strong>&lsquo;Share Our Wealth&rsquo;</strong> programme that would cap personal fortunes at $5 million and redistribute the rest to give every American family a minimum income of $5,000 per year, a free education, and a car. Long attracted millions of followers before he was assassinated in 1935.</li>
          <li><strong>Father Charles Coughlin</strong>, a Catholic priest with a radio audience of <strong>30&ndash;40 million</strong>, initially supported FDR but turned against him, calling the New Deal too friendly to bankers and not doing enough for ordinary people.</li>
          <li><strong>Dr Francis Townsend</strong> campaigned for a generous pension of <strong>$200 per month</strong> for all Americans over 60, funded by a national sales tax. His plan attracted 5 million supporters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Supreme Court</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Supreme Court</strong> posed a major threat to the New Deal. In 1935, it declared the <strong>NRA unconstitutional</strong>, and in 1936 it struck down the <strong>AAA</strong>. Conservative judges argued that many New Deal agencies gave the federal government powers that belonged to individual states. In 1937, Roosevelt tried to &lsquo;pack&rsquo; the Court by adding up to six extra, sympathetic judges. This <strong>&lsquo;court-packing&rsquo;</strong> plan was hugely controversial and was rejected by Congress, making Roosevelt look power-hungry.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Court-Packing Crisis</div>
          <p>Roosevelt&rsquo;s attempt to add extra judges to the Supreme Court in 1937 was his biggest political mistake. Even many of his supporters saw it as an attempt to undermine the independence of the courts. Although the plan failed, the Supreme Court began ruling more favourably on New Deal legislation afterwards &mdash; a shift sometimes called <strong>&lsquo;the switch in time that saved nine.&rsquo;</strong></p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Jobs created:</strong> Millions of Americans were put back to work through agencies like the CCC, PWA, and WPA. Unemployment fell from 25% in 1933 to around 14% by 1937.</p>
              <p><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> The New Deal built roads, bridges, dams, schools, hospitals, and airports that served America for decades. The TVA transformed an entire region.</p>
              <p><strong>Banking reform:</strong> The Emergency Banking Act and the creation of the <strong>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)</strong> restored confidence in the banking system and protected ordinary savers.</p>
              <p><strong>Social Security:</strong> The Social Security Act (1935) created a lasting welfare safety net &mdash; pensions, unemployment insurance, and disability support &mdash; that still exists today.</p>
              <p><strong>Workers&rsquo; rights:</strong> The Wagner Act strengthened trade unions and gave workers greater bargaining power.</p>
              <p><strong>Hope and confidence:</strong> Perhaps most importantly, the New Deal restored <strong>hope</strong>. Roosevelt&rsquo;s fireside chats, energetic leadership, and willingness to act gave Americans confidence that their government cared about them.</p>

              <p><strong>Did not end the Depression:</strong> Unemployment was still at <strong>14%</strong> in 1937, and when Roosevelt cut spending that year, the economy slipped back into recession (the <strong>&lsquo;Roosevelt Recession&rsquo;</strong>). It was ultimately <strong>World War Two</strong>, not the New Deal, that ended the Depression by creating massive demand for military production.</p>
              <p><strong>African Americans:</strong> The New Deal did relatively little for Black Americans. Many New Deal programmes discriminated &mdash; the CCC camps were segregated, and the AAA often benefited white landowners at the expense of Black sharecroppers. Roosevelt refused to support anti-lynching legislation, fearing he would lose the support of white Southern Democrats.</p>
              <p><strong>Women:</strong> Most New Deal jobs programmes were designed for men. Only around <strong>8,000 women</strong> were enrolled in CCC-equivalent programmes, compared to 3 million men. Some NRA codes actually set lower minimum wages for women than for men.</p>
              <p><strong>Massive government debt:</strong> The New Deal cost billions of dollars and hugely increased the national debt. Critics argued this was unsustainable.</p>
              <p><strong>Did not reform the economic system:</strong> The underlying structure of American capitalism remained unchanged. Wealth inequality persisted, and the fundamental problems that caused the Depression were not fully addressed.</p>

        <p>A very common exam question is: <strong>&lsquo;How successful was the New Deal?&rsquo;</strong> You must cover <strong>both successes and limitations</strong> with specific evidence. Remember to name specific agencies (CCC, TVA, WPA, AAA) and their achievements. A top-level answer will note that the New Deal improved lives and gave hope, but did not end the Depression &mdash; and that its benefits were <strong>unevenly distributed</strong>, particularly for African Americans and women.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Roosevelt&rsquo;s New Deal represented a fundamental shift in American government. For the first time, the federal government took direct responsibility for the welfare of its citizens, creating jobs, building infrastructure, and establishing a social safety net. The New Deal gave millions of Americans hope and practical help during the worst economic crisis in history. However, it did not end the Depression, and its benefits did not reach all Americans equally. The New Deal&rsquo;s lasting legacy was the principle that government has a duty to protect its people from the worst effects of economic disaster &mdash; a principle that remains central to American politics today.</p>
