        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">1930s Popular Culture</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Before looking at the war, it is important to understand American culture during the 1930s Depression. Despite widespread poverty, popular culture boomed &mdash; much of it was <strong>escapism</strong>, helping people forget their troubles.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n3"><strong>Jazz</strong> remained hugely popular. Big band <dfn class="term" data-def="A style of jazz music played by large ensembles (big bands) that dominated American popular music in the 1930s and 1940s, associated with dancing and entertainment.">swing</dfn> music filled dance halls across the country. In cinema, <strong>&lsquo;talkies&rsquo;</strong> (films with sound) had replaced silent films from <strong>1928</strong> onwards. Hollywood produced musicals, comedies, and adventure films that drew huge audiences. By the end of the 1930s, the <strong>first colour films</strong> appeared, including <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> (1939). <strong>Comic books</strong> also emerged in this period &mdash; Superman first appeared in <strong>1938</strong>. Radio remained the main source of home entertainment, with comedy shows, dramas, and music reaching millions. All of this culture gave Americans a way to escape the misery of the Depression, even if only for a few hours.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n4">From Neutrality to War</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">When war broke out in Europe in <strong>September 1939</strong>, most Americans wanted to stay out of it. However, Roosevelt gradually moved the USA towards supporting the Allies.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">In <strong>November 1939</strong>, Roosevelt introduced the <strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A US policy (1939) that allowed Britain and France to buy American weapons and supplies, as long as they paid cash and transported the goods in their own ships.">Cash and Carry</dfn> Plan</strong>. This allowed Britain and France to buy American weapons, as long as they paid cash and carried the goods in their own ships. It was an important stepping stone between neutrality and full involvement. Roosevelt also gave Britain <strong>50 old warships</strong> in exchange for the right to use British military bases &mdash; another step closer to war.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">Pearl Harbor</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n8">The United States entered <strong>World War Two</strong> on <strong>7 December 1941</strong>, after Japan&rsquo;s surprise attack on the US naval base at <strong>Pearl Harbor, Hawaii</strong>. The attack killed over <strong>2,400</strong> Americans and destroyed much of the Pacific fleet. President Roosevelt called it <em>&lsquo;a date which will live in infamy&rsquo;</em> and Congress declared war the next day.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n9">The war ended the <strong>Great Depression</strong>, reshaped the role of women and African Americans, and turned the USA into the world&rsquo;s leading superpower.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n10">Economic Recovery Through War Production</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">After a decade of <dfn class="term" data-def="A severe economic downturn lasting from 1929 to the late 1930s, marked by mass unemployment, falling production, and widespread poverty.">Depression</dfn>, wartime production created a huge economic boom. Factories that had stood idle were now running around the clock, producing weapons, vehicles, ships, and aircraft.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">Even <strong>before Pearl Harbor</strong>, the war economy was already working. By <strong>1941</strong>, unemployment had fallen to <strong>5 million</strong> as factories geared up to supply the Allies. The US government spent over <strong>$300 billion</strong> on the war effort between 1941 and 1945 &mdash; far more than anything the New Deal had attempted. This finally achieved <strong>full employment</strong>.</p>

        <figure data-narration-id="n13" class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_wwii_economic_transformation.jpg" alt="Infographic comparing the US economy before (1940) and after (1944) WWII — unemployment fell from 14.6% to 1.2%, industrial output doubled, and the USA produced 40% of the world's weapons">
        </figure>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n14">The War Production Miracle</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n15">American factories switched to war materials at astonishing speed. The <strong>Ford Willow Run plant</strong> in Michigan went from making cars to building <strong>B-24 Liberator bombers</strong> &mdash; at its peak, one every <strong>63 minutes</strong>. Shipbuilder <strong>Henry J. Kaiser</strong> cut <dfn class="term" data-def="Cargo ships mass-produced in American shipyards during WWII.">Liberty Ship</dfn> construction time from <strong>230 days</strong> to just <strong>42 days</strong>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n16">By 1945, American factories had produced <strong>300,000 aircraft</strong>, <strong>86,000 tanks</strong>, <strong>2.5 million trucks</strong>, and <strong>6,500 naval vessels</strong>.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n17">Cash and Carry, Lend-Lease, and Global Dominance</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n18">The <strong>Cash and Carry Plan</strong> (1939) was followed by the <strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A US programme (1941&ndash;1945) that supplied food, oil, weapons, and equipment to Allied nations fighting the Axis powers.">Lend-Lease</dfn> Act</strong>, signed on <strong>11 March 1941</strong>. Lend-Lease let the USA supply weapons, food, oil, and equipment to <strong>Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and other Allies</strong> without requiring immediate payment.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">Lend-Lease totalled <strong>$50.1 billion</strong> (over $700 billion today). Britain received <strong>$31.4 billion</strong>; the Soviet Union received <strong>$11.3 billion</strong>. These programmes kept the Allies fighting and <strong>boosted the American economy</strong> &mdash; factories producing Lend-Lease goods employed millions of workers.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">By <strong>1945</strong>, the USA held <strong>two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s gold reserves</strong> and produced <strong>half of the world&rsquo;s manufactured goods</strong>. Average wages rose by <strong>44%</strong> during the war. Personal savings jumped from <strong>$6.3 billion</strong> (1940) to <strong>$37 billion</strong> (1945).</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n21">The Experience of African Americans During WWII</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n22">World War Two was a turning point for <strong>African Americans</strong>. The war created new jobs, challenged racial attitudes, and planted the seeds of the civil rights movement. However, <dfn class="term" data-def="The policy or practice of separating people based on race, colour, or ethnicity, especially in public facilities, housing, education, and employment.">segregation</dfn> and discrimination continued throughout the war.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n23">The Double V Campaign</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n24">In <strong>February 1942</strong>, the <strong>Pittsburgh Courier</strong> &mdash; a leading Black newspaper &mdash; launched the <strong>&lsquo;Double V&rsquo; campaign</strong>. The two &lsquo;V&rsquo;s stood for <strong>victory abroad</strong> (against fascism) and <strong>victory at home</strong> (against racial discrimination). The campaign highlighted the contradiction of fighting for freedom overseas while Black Americans were denied basic rights at home.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n25">The Double V campaign gained huge support. It helped <strong>politicise</strong> African Americans and raised awareness of racial injustice among the wider public.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n26">A. Philip Randolph and Executive Order 8802</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n27"><strong>A. Philip Randolph</strong>, head of the <strong>Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters</strong> (a Black trade union), threatened to organise a <strong>March on Washington</strong> of <strong>100,000 African Americans</strong> in <strong>January 1941</strong> to protest racial discrimination in <dfn class="term" data-def="The factories, shipyards, and other facilities producing weapons, ammunition, vehicles, and supplies for the military during wartime.">defence industries</dfn>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n28">To prevent the march, Roosevelt issued <strong>Executive Order 8802</strong> on <strong>25 June 1941</strong> &mdash; the <strong>first federal order banning racial discrimination</strong> since Reconstruction. It banned discrimination in defence industries and set up the <strong>Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC)</strong>.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n29" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Executive Order 8802</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n30">This was the <strong>first presidential executive order on race</strong> since the Civil War era. African Americans in defence industries rose from <strong>3%</strong> (1942) to <strong>8%</strong> (1945). Over <strong>one million</strong> Black workers gained factory jobs. However, African Americans were typically paid <strong>half of what white workers earned</strong> for the same roles. The FEPC had <strong>limited enforcement powers</strong> &mdash; it could investigate but not force employers to comply.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n31">African Americans in the Military</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n32">Over <strong>one million African Americans</strong> served in the US military during WWII. The armed forces remained <strong>strictly segregated</strong> &mdash; Black soldiers served in separate units, often under white officers, and were frequently given non-combat roles like loading cargo.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n33">Despite this, some Black units won distinction. The <strong>Tuskegee Airmen</strong> &mdash; the first African American fighter pilots &mdash; flew over <strong>15,000 missions</strong>. The <strong>761st Tank Battalion</strong> fought in the Battle of the Bulge and earned a Presidential Unit Citation. These achievements undermined racist claims that Black soldiers were inferior.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n34">The Great Migration Accelerates</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n35">The war sped up the <strong>Great Migration</strong> of African Americans from the rural South to northern and western cities. Between <strong>1940 and 1945</strong>, about <strong>1.5 million</strong> Black Americans moved to cities like <strong>Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh</strong> for factory work.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n36">This brought new opportunities but also tension. In <strong>June 1943</strong>, a <strong>race riot</strong> in <strong>Detroit</strong> lasted three days and left <strong>34 people dead</strong> (25 of them African American). White workers often resented Black newcomers competing for jobs and housing.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n37">The Experience of Women During WWII</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n38">With <strong>16 million men</strong> in the armed forces, women were urgently needed to fill their jobs. The scale of female employment was unprecedented.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n39">&lsquo;Rosie the Riveter&rsquo;</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n40">The government launched a propaganda campaign to recruit women. The iconic <strong>&lsquo;Rosie the Riveter&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; a strong woman in overalls flexing her bicep with the slogan <strong>&lsquo;We Can Do It!&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; became the symbol of women&rsquo;s wartime contribution.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Women in the Workforce</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n42">Working women rose from <strong>12 million</strong> (1940) to <strong>18 million</strong> (1945). By 1944, women made up <strong>37%</strong> of the workforce. Over <strong>300,000 women</strong> served in military roles such as the <strong>Women&rsquo;s Army Corps (WAC)</strong> and <strong>WAVES</strong>. The <strong>WASPs</strong> (Women Airforce Service Pilots) were trained to deliver aircraft to war zones, freeing up male pilots for combat. Women worked as welders, riveters, electricians, and crane operators &mdash; jobs previously seen as impossible for women.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n43">Limitations for Women</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n44">Women still faced real inequality. They earned only <strong>65%</strong> of what men earned for the same work. Childcare was a major problem &mdash; the government funded some <dfn class="term" data-def="Childcare centres established during WWII to allow mothers to work in war industries.">day nurseries</dfn>, but provision was poor. Women were expected to go back to domestic roles once the war ended.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n45">After 1945, <strong>4 million women</strong> left the workforce to make way for returning soldiers. Surveys showed <strong>75%</strong> of wartime women workers wanted to keep their jobs. The experience of wartime work changed women&rsquo;s expectations permanently and laid the groundwork for the later feminist movement.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n46">Japanese American Internment</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n47">One of the darkest episodes of the war was the forced <dfn class="term" data-def="The forced relocation and imprisonment of approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans (most of them US citizens) in remote camps during WWII, authorised by Executive Order 9066 in February 1942.">internment</dfn> of Japanese Americans. After Pearl Harbor, anti-Japanese hysteria swept the country. In <strong>February 1942</strong>, Roosevelt signed <strong>Executive Order 9066</strong>, authorising the removal of all people of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n48">About <strong>120,000 Japanese Americans</strong> &mdash; <strong>two-thirds of them US citizens</strong> &mdash; were forced into <strong>ten remote internment camps</strong>. Families had only days to sell their homes and possessions, often for a fraction of their value. They lost an estimated <strong>$400 million</strong> in property.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n49">Camps were surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards. Families lived in cramped barracks with shared facilities. Despite this, internees organised schools, newspapers, and community activities.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n50">No Japanese American was ever found guilty of spying or sabotage. The internment was driven by <strong>racial prejudice</strong>, wartime hysteria, and economic jealousy. Japanese Americans in <strong>Hawaii</strong> were <strong>not</strong> interned, even though they made up a third of the population there.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n51">In <strong>1988</strong>, President <strong>Reagan</strong> signed the <strong>Civil Liberties Act</strong>, formally apologising and awarding <strong>$20,000</strong> to each surviving internee.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n52">The GI Bill (1944)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n53">The <strong><dfn class="term" data-def="Officially the Servicemen&rsquo;s Readjustment Act of 1944, this law provided returning WWII veterans with benefits including college tuition, low-cost home loans, and unemployment insurance, dramatically expanding the American middle class.">GI Bill</dfn></strong> (officially the <strong>Servicemen&rsquo;s Readjustment Act</strong>), signed on <strong>22 June 1944</strong>, helped <strong>16 million</strong> returning veterans readjust to civilian life. It provided:</p>
        <ul data-narration-id="n61">
          <li><strong>College or vocational education</strong> &mdash; the government paid tuition and a living allowance. By 1956, nearly <strong>8 million veterans</strong> had used this.</li>
          <li><strong>Low-cost home loans</strong> &mdash; no deposit required, fuelling the post-war suburban boom.</li>
          <li><strong>Unemployment insurance</strong> &mdash; <strong>$20 per week</strong> for up to a year (nicknamed the &lsquo;52-20 Club&rsquo;).</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n54">The GI Bill is often credited with <strong>creating the American middle class</strong>. However, many <strong>African American veterans</strong> could not benefit equally &mdash; racist banks denied them home loans, and white universities (especially in the South) refused to admit them.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n56">When answering questions about WWII&rsquo;s impact, cover <strong>economic, social, and racial dimensions</strong>. Use statistics: unemployment fell from 14.6% to 1.2%; women workers rose from 12 million to 18 million. Show how the war created both progress <strong>and</strong> contradictions for African Americans (Executive Order 8802 versus continued segregation and half pay). A top answer links these themes &mdash; war production drew women and African Americans into the workforce, raising expectations that fuelled post-war demands for equality.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div data-narration-id="n57" class="conclusion">
        <h2 data-narration-id="n58">Conclusion</h2>
        <p data-narration-id="n59">World War Two transformed the United States. Massive government spending ended the Depression, and America emerged as the world&rsquo;s dominant superpower. Millions of women entered the workforce, and African Americans gained new jobs while challenging segregation. Yet deep contradictions remained: Japanese Americans were interned, the military stayed segregated, African Americans were paid half of white wages, and women were pushed back into domestic roles after 1945. The rising expectations the war created would shape the decades that followed.</p>
        <h3 data-narration-id="n60">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n62">
          <li><strong>Economic transformation:</strong> Cash and Carry (1939) and Lend-Lease ($50.1 billion) supported the Allies and boosted American industry. Unemployment dropped from 14.6% to 1.2%. The USA emerged holding two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s gold reserves.</li>
          <li><strong>Seeds of civil rights:</strong> The Double V campaign, Executive Order 8802, and over one million Black soldiers&rsquo; service challenged discrimination &mdash; but African Americans still faced segregation and were paid half of white wages.</li>
          <li><strong>Women&rsquo;s changing role:</strong> Six million women entered the workforce. WASPs delivered aircraft to war zones. Although most women were pushed out after 1945, their experience changed expectations permanently.</li>

American factories switched from consumer goods to military equipment at astonishing speed. The Ford Willow Run plant went from making cars to building B-24 bombers \u2014 at its peak, one every 63 minutes.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: Both groups saw real progress but also continued inequality. For African Americans, Executive Order 8802 (1941) banned discrimination in defence industries for the first time, increasing Black workers from 3% to 8%. The Double V campaign politicised Black Americans by demanding victory over fascism abroad and racism at home. Over one million served in the military \u2014 the Tuskegee Airmen flew 15,000 missions. However, the military remained segregated, Black workers earned half of white wages, and the 1943 Detroit race riot (34 dead) showed ongoing tensions. For women, the workforce grew from 12 million to 18 million \u2014 37% of workers by 1944. They became welders, riveters, and pilots (WASPs). Over 300,000 served in military roles like the WAC and WAVES. But women earned only 65% of men\u2019s pay, and after 1945, 4 million were pushed out to make way for returning soldiers, despite 75% wanting to keep their jobs. Both groups\u2019 wartime experiences raised expectations that fuelled post-war demands for equality.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Women entered the workforce in huge numbers \u2014 from 12 million to 18 million by 1945. \u2018Rosie the Riveter\u2019 became the symbol of women\u2019s contribution. African Americans gained factory jobs through Executive Order 8802, and the Double V campaign raised awareness of racial injustice. However, both groups still faced inequality: women earned 65% of men\u2019s wages, and the military remained segregated.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: Many women got jobs in factories during the war because 16 million men were in the armed forces. By 1944, women made up 37% of the workforce.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s).

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: Japanese Americans suffered one of the worst violations of civil liberties in American history. After Pearl Harbor (December 1941), anti-Japanese hysteria swept the country. In February 1942, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorising the forced removal of all people of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast. About 120,000 Japanese Americans \u2014 two-thirds of them US citizens \u2014 were sent to ten remote internment camps. Families had only days to sell their homes and possessions, often for a fraction of their value, losing an estimated $400 million in property. Camps were surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards, and families lived in cramped barracks. No Japanese American was ever found guilty of spying or sabotage \u2014 the internment was driven by racial prejudice and wartime hysteria. Significantly, Japanese Americans in Hawaii were not interned, even though they made up a third of the population there, suggesting economic jealousy and racism were the real motives. The long-term impact was devastating: communities were broken apart and livelihoods destroyed. It was not until 1988 that President Reagan formally apologised and awarded $20,000 to each surviving internee.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: The New Deal had a huge impact on the role of government. Roosevelt\u2019s alphabet agencies (CCC, WPA, TVA) employed millions and built lasting infrastructure. The Social Security Act (1935) created America\u2019s first welfare state. The Wagner Act strengthened trade unions. Total spending was $50.2 billion, and unemployment fell from 14 million to 7 million by 1937. However, the New Deal did not end the Depression \u2014 the \u2018Roosevelt Recession\u2019 (1937) saw unemployment jump back to 10 million. The Second World War had an even greater impact. Government spending of $300 billion dwarfed the New Deal and finally achieved full employment. Unemployment fell from 14.6% to 1.2%. Average wages rose 44%. Personal savings jumped from $6.3 billion to $37 billion. By 1945, the USA held two-thirds of the world\u2019s gold reserves and produced half its manufactured goods. The war also transformed society: 18 million women entered the workforce, Executive Order 8802 opened defence jobs to African Americans, and the GI Bill (1944) helped 8 million veterans attend college. Both had lasting impacts, but the war was the turning point \u2014 it ended the Depression, created the American superpower, and raised expectations for equality that shaped the next 30 years.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): The New Deal created the CCC (3 million employed), WPA (8.5 million), and Social Security Act. It established the principle that government should help citizens. But it did not end the Depression.\nExample (bullet 2): WWII ended the Depression through $300 billion in spending. Women workers rose from 12 million to 18 million. The GI Bill helped 8 million veterans get education. The USA became the world\u2019s dominant superpower.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The Second World War ended the Depression because government spending of $300 billion created full employment.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Both the New Deal and the war helped America.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        text: "Which of the following had more impact on the lives of African Americans:\n\n\u2022 wartime employment opportunities\n\u2022 military service during the Second World War?\n\nExplain your answer with reference to both bullet points.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both employment and military service transformed African American life, but in different ways. Wartime employment had the most immediate economic impact. A. Philip Randolph\u2019s threatened March on Washington forced Roosevelt to issue Executive Order 8802 (June 1941) \u2014 the first federal order banning racial discrimination since Reconstruction. African Americans in defence industries rose from 3% to 8%, and over one million gained factory jobs. The Great Migration accelerated \u2014 1.5 million Black Americans moved to northern and western cities for factory work between 1940 and 1945. However, Black workers were typically paid half of white wages, and the Detroit race riot (1943, 34 dead) showed the tensions new migration caused. Military service had a more symbolic and political impact. Over one million African Americans served, and units like the Tuskegee Airmen (15,000 missions) and the 761st Tank Battalion proved Black soldiers\u2019 ability. The Double V campaign \u2014 demanding victory over fascism abroad and racism at home \u2014 politicised millions. Service challenged racist claims of Black inferiority and gave veterans confidence to demand their rights. Both were important, but employment changes had a more direct, widespread economic effect on millions of families, while military service planted the seeds of the civil rights movement.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Executive Order 8802 banned discrimination in defence industries. Over one million Black workers gained factory jobs. 1.5 million moved north during the Great Migration.\nExample (bullet 2): The Tuskegee Airmen flew 15,000 missions. The Double V campaign demanded victory over racism at home as well as fascism abroad. Over one million served.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Executive Order 8802 banned discrimination in defence industries, and African Americans in those jobs rose from 3% to 8%.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: African Americans got more jobs and served in the army during WWII.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."
