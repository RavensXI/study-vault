        <h2>Why Did Americans Fear Communism?</h2>

        <p>After World War Two, the USA and the <strong>Soviet Union (USSR)</strong> emerged as rival superpowers with opposing ideologies. The USA championed <strong>capitalism</strong> and <strong>democracy</strong>, while the USSR promoted <strong>communism</strong> &mdash; a system where the state controls the economy and there is no private property or free enterprise. The growing tension between the two superpowers became known as the <strong>Cold War</strong>.</p>

        <p>Several events in the late 1940s dramatically increased American fear of communism:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>1945:</strong> A Soviet spy ring was uncovered in Canada, raising fears of communist espionage in North America.</li>
          <li><strong>1947:</strong> President Truman announced the <strong>Truman Doctrine</strong>, pledging to contain the spread of communism worldwide.</li>
          <li><strong>1948&ndash;49:</strong> The <strong>Berlin Blockade</strong> heightened Cold War tensions in Europe.</li>
          <li><strong>1949:</strong> <strong>China became communist</strong> under Mao Zedong &mdash; the world&rsquo;s most populous nation had &lsquo;fallen&rsquo; to communism, shocking and alarming Americans.</li>
          <li><strong>1949:</strong> The Soviet Union successfully tested its <strong>first atomic bomb</strong>, ending America&rsquo;s nuclear monopoly. Many Americans believed the Soviets must have stolen the technology through espionage.</li>
          <li><strong>1950&ndash;53:</strong> The <strong>Korean War</strong> saw American soldiers fighting communist forces, making the communist threat feel immediate and real.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Fear Factor</div>
          <p>By 1950, Americans were genuinely terrified. Two of their wartime allies &mdash; China and the USSR &mdash; were now hostile communist powers with nuclear weapons. Fear of communist infiltration, atomic attack, and the &lsquo;domino effect&rsquo; (the idea that if one country fell to communism, its neighbours would follow) created a climate of suspicion and paranoia across the United States.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>HUAC and the Hollywood Ten</h2>

        <p>The <strong>House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)</strong> was a committee of the US House of Representatives established to investigate suspected communist activity within the United States. Although it had existed since 1938, it became much more active and high-profile after the war.</p>

        <h3>HUAC Targets Hollywood (1947)</h3>
        <p>In <strong>October 1947</strong>, HUAC turned its attention to the <strong>film industry</strong>, believing that communists had infiltrated Hollywood and were using movies to spread communist propaganda. The committee summoned dozens of writers, directors, and actors to testify.</p>

        <p>Most &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; witnesses cooperated, naming colleagues they suspected of communist sympathies. However, <strong>ten writers and directors</strong> &mdash; known as the <strong>&lsquo;Hollywood Ten&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; refused to answer HUAC&rsquo;s questions, citing their <strong>First Amendment rights</strong> to free speech and freedom of association. They were found in <strong>contempt of Congress</strong>, sentenced to between <strong>6 and 12 months</strong> in prison, and fined <strong>$1,000</strong> each.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Hollywood Blacklist</div>
          <p>Following the HUAC hearings, the major Hollywood studios created a <strong>blacklist</strong> &mdash; a secret list of people suspected of communist sympathies who were banned from working in the film industry. At its peak, the blacklist included over <strong>300 actors, writers, directors, and producers</strong>. Many had their careers destroyed. Some worked under <strong>pseudonyms</strong> (false names), while others left the country. The blacklist continued into the 1960s and remains one of the most controversial episodes in American cultural history.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Alger Hiss Case (1948&ndash;1950)</h2>

        <p>The <strong>Alger Hiss</strong> case was one of the most dramatic spy scandals of the era. Hiss was a senior <strong>State Department official</strong> who had been involved in establishing the <strong>United Nations</strong>. In 1948, a former communist agent named <strong>Whittaker Chambers</strong> accused Hiss of being a Soviet spy who had passed secret government documents to the USSR in the 1930s.</p>

        <p>Hiss denied the charges, but <strong>Richard Nixon</strong> &mdash; then a young congressman on HUAC &mdash; pursued the case aggressively. Chambers produced microfilm copies of stolen documents (hidden inside a pumpkin on his farm, earning them the name <strong>&lsquo;Pumpkin Papers&rsquo;</strong>). Hiss could not be charged with espionage because the statute of limitations had expired, but he was convicted of <strong>perjury</strong> (lying under oath) in <strong>January 1950</strong> and sentenced to <strong>5 years</strong> in prison.</p>

        <p>The Hiss case had an enormous impact. If a senior government official could be a Soviet spy, then communists might be anywhere &mdash; even at the highest levels of government. The case made Nixon&rsquo;s career and convinced many Americans that communist infiltration was a genuine threat.</p>

        <h2>The Rosenbergs (1950&ndash;1953)</h2>

        <p><strong>Julius and Ethel Rosenberg</strong> were American citizens accused of passing <strong>atomic bomb secrets</strong> to the Soviet Union. Julius was an electrical engineer who had worked on military contracts during the war. The FBI arrested the couple in <strong>1950</strong>, charging them with espionage.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Rosenberg Trial</div>
          <p>The Rosenbergs were tried in <strong>March 1951</strong> and found guilty. They were sentenced to <strong>death</strong> &mdash; the first American civilians to be executed for espionage. Despite worldwide protests and appeals for clemency (even <strong>Pope Pius XII</strong> and <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> urged mercy), both were <strong>executed by electric chair</strong> on <strong>19 June 1953</strong>. The case remains controversial &mdash; later evidence confirmed Julius was involved in espionage, but many historians believe Ethel&rsquo;s involvement was minimal and her execution was unjust.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Senator Joseph McCarthy</h2>

        <p><strong>Joseph McCarthy</strong> was a Republican senator from Wisconsin who became the central figure of the anti-communist crusade. On <strong>9 February 1950</strong>, McCarthy gave a speech in <strong>Wheeling, West Virginia</strong>, in which he claimed to have a list of <strong>205 communists</strong> working in the <strong>State Department</strong>. The number changed in subsequent speeches (sometimes 57, sometimes 81), and McCarthy never produced any actual evidence, but the accusation generated enormous publicity.</p>

        <h3>McCarthy&rsquo;s Methods</h3>
        <p>McCarthy used fear, intimidation, and publicity to pursue his anti-communist campaign:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>He made <strong>wild, unsubstantiated accusations</strong> against individuals, claiming they were communists or communist sympathisers without producing evidence.</li>
          <li>He used his position as chairman of the <strong>Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations</strong> to hold public hearings where he <strong>bullied and humiliated</strong> witnesses.</li>
          <li>Anyone who challenged McCarthy risked being accused of being a communist themselves. This created a climate of fear where few dared to speak out.</li>
          <li>He accused a wide range of targets, including government officials, army officers, university professors, journalists, and even fellow senators.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>McCarthy&rsquo;s power was fuelled by the genuine fear Americans felt. With the Korean War ongoing and the Soviets possessing nuclear weapons, accusations of communist infiltration struck a chord with the public. At his peak, McCarthy had an <strong>approval rating of 50%</strong>.</p>

        <h3>The Federal Loyalty Programme</h3>
        <p>The anti-communist hysteria extended beyond McCarthy. In <strong>1947</strong>, President Truman had introduced <strong>Executive Order 9835</strong> &mdash; the <strong>Federal Employee Loyalty Program</strong> &mdash; which required all federal employees to be investigated for &lsquo;disloyalty.&rsquo; Between 1947 and 1953, around <strong>6.6 million</strong> government employees were investigated. Although only around <strong>500</strong> were dismissed, the programme created an atmosphere of suspicion and fear throughout the government.</p>

        <h2>The Army-McCarthy Hearings (1954)</h2>

        <p>McCarthy&rsquo;s downfall came when he overreached by accusing the <strong>US Army</strong> of harbouring communists. The resulting <strong>Army-McCarthy hearings</strong> were held from <strong>April to June 1954</strong> and were <strong>televised nationally</strong>, allowing <strong>20 million Americans</strong> to watch McCarthy in action for the first time.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; &lsquo;Have You No Sense of Decency?&rsquo;</div>
          <p>The crucial moment came on <strong>9 June 1954</strong>, when the Army&rsquo;s lawyer, <strong>Joseph Welch</strong>, confronted McCarthy after he attacked a young lawyer in Welch&rsquo;s firm. Welch responded: <em>&lsquo;Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?&rsquo;</em> The gallery burst into applause. The exchange, watched by millions on television, exposed McCarthy as a bully and destroyed his credibility.</p>
        </div>

        <p>In <strong>December 1954</strong>, the Senate voted <strong>67 to 22</strong> to <strong>censure</strong> (formally condemn) McCarthy for conduct &lsquo;contrary to senatorial traditions.&rsquo; His power was broken. McCarthy became increasingly isolated, turned to heavy drinking, and died on <strong>2 May 1957</strong>, aged just 48.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Civil Liberties</h2>

        <p>The Red Scare and McCarthyism had a profound and damaging impact on American civil liberties:</p>

            <span>How civil liberties were affected</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Freedom of speech:</strong> People were afraid to express political opinions that might be seen as &lsquo;left-wing&rsquo; or sympathetic to communism. Teachers, professors, writers, and artists self-censored for fear of being investigated or blacklisted.</p>
              <p><strong>Freedom of association:</strong> Belonging to any organisation that could be linked to the political left &mdash; even decades in the past &mdash; could lead to investigation, dismissal, or blacklisting. People avoided joining unions, civil rights groups, or peace organisations.</p>
              <p><strong>Due process:</strong> Many people were accused without evidence and denied the chance to defend themselves properly. HUAC hearings were not legal trials, and witnesses often had no right to legal representation. The principle of &lsquo;innocent until proven guilty&rsquo; was effectively reversed &mdash; the accused had to <strong>prove their innocence</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>Careers destroyed:</strong> Thousands of Americans lost their jobs based on accusations rather than evidence. Teachers, government workers, entertainers, and journalists were fired or blacklisted. Many never recovered professionally.</p>
              <p><strong>The McCarran Internal Security Act (1950):</strong> Required communist organisations to register with the government and gave the President power to detain suspected subversives during a national emergency. Truman vetoed it, calling it &lsquo;the greatest danger to freedom of speech, press, and assembly since the Alien and Sedition Laws of 1798,&rsquo; but Congress overrode his veto.</p>
              <p><strong>Chilling effect on reform:</strong> The Red Scare made it harder to campaign for social change. Civil rights activists were accused of being communists, which was used to discredit the movement. Trade unionists, peace campaigners, and reformers of all kinds were targeted and silenced.</p>

      <div class="exam-tip">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When writing about McCarthyism, make sure you can explain both <strong>why it happened</strong> (genuine fear of communism fuelled by real events like the Soviet bomb and the fall of China) and <strong>why it was damaging</strong> (destruction of civil liberties, careers ruined without evidence, climate of fear). The strongest answers will discuss the <strong>tension between national security and individual freedom</strong> &mdash; a theme that the examiner expects you to explore. Remember to use specific cases: the Hollywood Ten, Alger Hiss, the Rosenbergs, and the Army-McCarthy hearings.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Red Scare and McCarthyism represented one of the darkest chapters in American civil liberties. While the fear of communism was rooted in genuine Cold War tensions, the response went far beyond reasonable security measures. Senator McCarthy exploited public fear to build personal power, destroying careers and lives with unsubstantiated accusations. HUAC, the Hollywood blacklist, and the loyalty programmes created a climate where free speech and free association were effectively suspended. The Army-McCarthy hearings finally exposed McCarthy as a bully, but the damage to American democracy and individual freedoms had already been done.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Context matters:</strong> The Red Scare was driven by real fears &mdash; the Soviet bomb (1949), communist China (1949), the Korean War (1950&ndash;53), and genuine spy cases like Hiss and the Rosenbergs.</li>
          <li><strong>HUAC and the blacklist:</strong> The Hollywood Ten were jailed. Over 300 entertainment figures were blacklisted. Careers were destroyed based on suspicion, not evidence.</li>
          <li><strong>McCarthy&rsquo;s rise and fall:</strong> McCarthy claimed communists had infiltrated government (1950), but never produced evidence. He was censured by the Senate in December 1954 after the Army-McCarthy hearings exposed his methods.</li>
          <li><strong>Civil liberties damaged:</strong> Freedom of speech, association, and due process were all undermined. Thousands lost their jobs. The climate of fear silenced reformers and activists.</li>
        </ul>
