        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">FDR&rsquo;s Election in 1932</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2"><strong>Franklin Delano Roosevelt</strong> (known as FDR) won the <strong>1932 presidential election</strong> in a landslide, defeating the unpopular Herbert Hoover. He won <strong>42 of 48 states</strong> and <strong>57%</strong> of the popular vote. Americans were desperate for change. Roosevelt promised a <strong>&lsquo;New Deal&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; a bold programme of government action to tackle the Depression.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n3" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Roosevelt&rsquo;s Promise</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n4">In his acceptance speech, Roosevelt declared: <em>&lsquo;I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people.&rsquo;</em> At his inauguration on <strong>4 March 1933</strong>, he said: <em>&lsquo;The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&rsquo;</em> He projected confidence and energy &mdash; a sharp contrast with Hoover&rsquo;s perceived inaction.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n5">Roosevelt&rsquo;s Approach</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n6">FDR&rsquo;s approach was very different from Hoover&rsquo;s. He believed the federal government had a <strong>responsibility to help</strong> ordinary Americans in crisis. He surrounded himself with the <strong>&lsquo;Brain Trust&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; a team of expert advisors from universities and business &mdash; to design his policies. His New Deal had three main aims, known as the <strong>&lsquo;Three Rs&rsquo;</strong>:</p>

        <figure data-narration-id="n7" class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_new_deal_three_rs.png" alt="Infographic showing Roosevelt's New Deal Three Rs: Relief (immediate help for unemployed and homeless), Recovery (creating jobs and boosting spending), and Reform (changing laws to prevent another depression)">
        </figure>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">A key idea behind the New Deal was <strong><dfn class="term" data-def="The economic idea that if the government spends money to create jobs, those workers then spend their wages in shops and businesses, which in turn hire more workers &mdash; creating a cycle of rising prosperity.">&lsquo;priming the pump&rsquo;</dfn></strong>. If the government spent money to create jobs, those workers would spend their wages in shops and businesses, which would then hire more workers. This would create a cycle of rising prosperity. In total, the New Deal cost <strong>$50.2 billion</strong> &mdash; the biggest government spending programme in world history at the time.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n9">The First Hundred Days (March&ndash;June 1933)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">Roosevelt acted fast. In his first <strong>100 days</strong>, he pushed <strong>15 major pieces of legislation</strong> through Congress. He also used <strong>&lsquo;fireside chats&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; radio broadcasts to the nation &mdash; to explain his policies in simple, reassuring language. Around <strong>60 million Americans</strong> listened.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n11">The Emergency Banking Act (March 1933)</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n12">Roosevelt&rsquo;s first act was to declare a <strong>&lsquo;bank holiday&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; closing all banks for four days. Government inspectors checked every bank&rsquo;s accounts. Only sound banks were allowed to reopen. This restored public confidence, and within weeks Americans were depositing money back into banks instead of hiding it at home.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n13">The Alphabet Agencies</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n14">The New Deal created many new government agencies to tackle different parts of the Depression. These became known as the <strong>&lsquo;alphabet agencies&rsquo;</strong> because of their abbreviations:</p>

        <div class="collapsible">

            <span>Key alphabet agencies in detail</span>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n15"><strong>CCC &mdash; Civilian Conservation Corps (1933):</strong> Gave work to young unemployed men aged 18&ndash;25 in conservation projects &mdash; planting trees, building roads, and preventing soil erosion. Workers received <strong>$30 per month</strong> ($25 sent home to their families). By 1942, around <strong>3 million</strong> young men had worked in the CCC. It planted over <strong>3 billion trees</strong>. Around <strong>200,000 African Americans</strong> served in the CCC, but <strong>women were banned entirely</strong>.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n16"><strong>AAA &mdash; Agricultural Adjustment Administration (1933):</strong> Aimed to raise farm prices by <strong>paying farmers to produce less</strong>. Reducing supply pushed crop prices up. Farm income doubled between 1933 and 1939. However, critics argued it was wrong to destroy food when millions were hungry. It also hurt sharecroppers and tenant farmers who were evicted when landowners took land out of production.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n17"><strong>TVA &mdash; Tennessee Valley Authority (1933):</strong> A huge government project to develop the <strong>Tennessee Valley</strong>, one of the poorest regions in America. The TVA built <strong>21 dams</strong> to control flooding, generate cheap hydroelectric power, and improve navigation. It brought electricity to rural areas for the first time and transformed the region&rsquo;s economy. The TVA is often seen as the <strong>most successful</strong> New Deal programme.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n18"><strong>NRA &mdash; National Recovery Administration (1933):</strong> Set <strong>minimum wages, maximum working hours</strong>, and banned child labour. Businesses that signed up displayed the <strong>&lsquo;Blue Eagle&rsquo;</strong> symbol. However, the Supreme Court declared the NRA <strong>unconstitutional</strong> in 1935 because it gave the federal government too much power over businesses.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n19"><strong>FERA &mdash; Federal Emergency Relief Administration (1933):</strong> Gave <strong>$500 million</strong> in grants to states for direct relief &mdash; food, clothing, and shelter. This was the first time the federal government had given money directly to help the poor.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n20"><strong>CWA &mdash; Civil Works Administration (1933):</strong> Run by <strong>Harry Hopkins</strong>, the CWA quickly created <strong>4 million short-term jobs</strong> for unskilled workers during the harsh winter of 1933&ndash;34 &mdash; building roads, schools, and airports. It was replaced by the WPA in 1935.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n21"><strong>PWA &mdash; Public Works Administration (1933):</strong> Run by <strong>Harold Ickes</strong>, the PWA focused on large-scale, <strong>skilled</strong> construction projects. It spent over <strong>$6 billion</strong> building <strong>34,000 projects</strong>, including the <strong>Triborough Bridge</strong> in New York. The PWA used skilled workers; the CWA and WPA used mostly unskilled labour. This was a key distinction.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n22"><strong>WPA &mdash; Works Progress Administration (1935):</strong> The largest New Deal agency. Run by <strong>Harry Hopkins</strong>, the WPA employed around <strong>8.5 million people</strong> between 1935 and 1943. It built <strong>650,000 miles of roads, 125,000 public buildings, and 8,000 parks</strong>. It also employed artists, writers, actors, and musicians. Critics mocked some WPA jobs as <strong>&lsquo;boondoggles&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; pointless make-work like sweeping leaves, scaring pigeons from buildings, or putting on plays. The word came from old cowboy slang for a useless task.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n23">The Second New Deal (1935&ndash;1937)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">In 1935, Roosevelt launched a <strong>second wave</strong> of New Deal laws, focusing more on long-term reform and social welfare:</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n25">The Social Security Act (1935)</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n26">This was arguably the most important and lasting New Deal reform. It created:</p>
        <ul data-narration-id="n60">
          <li>A national <strong>pension system</strong> for Americans over 65</li>
          <li><strong>Unemployment insurance</strong> &mdash; for the first time, workers who lost their jobs received temporary financial support</li>
          <li>Financial help for the <strong>disabled</strong> and for <strong>mothers with dependent children</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p data-narration-id="n27">The Social Security Act created America&rsquo;s first <strong>welfare state</strong>. It established the principle that the federal government had a duty to care for its citizens &mdash; a revolutionary idea in the United States.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n28">The Wagner Act (1935)</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n29">Also known as the <strong>National Labor Relations Act</strong>, this gave workers the legal right to <strong>join trade unions</strong> and <strong>bargain collectively</strong> with employers. It set up the <strong>National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)</strong> to protect workers&rsquo; rights. Union membership grew from <strong>3.7 million</strong> in 1933 to <strong>9 million</strong> by 1938.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n30">Opposition to the New Deal</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n31">Despite its popularity, the New Deal faced strong opposition from several directions:</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n32">Opposition from the Right (Republicans and Big Business)</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n61">
          <li>Republicans and business leaders accused Roosevelt of <strong>spending too much</strong> and creating dangerous federal power.</li>
          <li>They called the New Deal <strong>&lsquo;socialism&rsquo;</strong> or even &lsquo;communism,&rsquo; saying it interfered with free enterprise and individual liberty.</li>
          <li>The <strong>American Liberty League</strong>, funded by wealthy businessmen, campaigned against the New Deal.</li>
          <li>Critics also attacked <strong>&lsquo;boondoggles&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; claiming the government was paying people to do pointless jobs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n33">Opposition from the Left</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n62">
          <li><strong>Huey Long</strong>, the populist Senator from Louisiana, argued the New Deal did not go far enough. He proposed a <strong>&lsquo;Share Our Wealth&rsquo;</strong> programme that would cap personal fortunes at <strong>$3 million</strong> and redistribute the rest to give every American family a minimum income of $5,000 per year, a free education, and a car. Long attracted millions of followers before he was assassinated in 1935.</li>
          <li><strong>Father Charles Coughlin</strong>, a Catholic priest with a radio audience of <strong>30&ndash;40 million</strong>, initially supported FDR but turned against him. He called the New Deal too friendly to bankers and not doing enough for ordinary people.</li>
          <li><strong>Dr Francis Townsend</strong> campaigned for a pension of <strong>$200 per month</strong> for all Americans over 60, funded by a national sales tax. His plan attracted 5 million supporters.</li>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n34">The Supreme Court</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n35">The <strong>Supreme Court</strong> was a major threat to the New Deal. In 1935, it declared the <strong>NRA unconstitutional</strong>, and in 1936 it struck down the <strong>AAA</strong>. Conservative judges argued that New Deal agencies gave the federal government powers that belonged to individual states. In 1937, Roosevelt tried to &lsquo;pack&rsquo; the Court by adding up to six extra, sympathetic judges. This <strong>&lsquo;court-packing&rsquo;</strong> plan was hugely controversial and was rejected by Congress.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Court-Packing Crisis</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n37">Roosevelt&rsquo;s attempt to add extra judges in 1937 was his biggest political mistake. Even his supporters saw it as an attempt to undermine the courts&rsquo; independence. The plan failed, but the Supreme Court then began ruling more favourably on New Deal laws &mdash; a shift called <strong>&lsquo;the switch in time that saved nine.&rsquo;</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n38">Despite all this opposition, Roosevelt won the <strong>1936 election</strong> in a landslide, carrying <strong>all but 2 states</strong>. He joked: <em>&lsquo;Everyone is against the New Deal &mdash; except the voters!&rsquo;</em> This showed that ordinary Americans strongly supported his programmes, even if the rich and powerful did not.</p>

              <p data-narration-id="n48"><strong>African Americans:</strong> The New Deal did little for Black Americans. CCC camps were segregated.

        <h3 data-narration-id="n52">States&rsquo; Rights vs Federal Government</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n53">The New Deal permanently changed the relationship between the federal government and the American people. Before Roosevelt, most Americans expected <strong>state governments</strong> &mdash; not Washington &mdash; to handle welfare, jobs, and economic problems. The New Deal shifted power to the <strong>federal government</strong> on a scale never seen before. This was a revolutionary change. From this point on, Americans looked to the president and Congress to solve national crises. The debate over <strong>states&rsquo; rights versus federal power</strong> remains one of the biggest issues in American politics today.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n55">A common exam question is: <strong>&lsquo;How successful was the New Deal?&rsquo;</strong> Cover <strong>both successes and limitations</strong> with specific evidence. Name agencies (CCC, TVA, WPA, AAA) and their achievements. Use the term <strong>&lsquo;priming the pump&rsquo;</strong> to show you understand the economic thinking. A top answer will note the New Deal gave hope and created jobs, but did not end the Depression &mdash; and that its benefits were <strong>unevenly distributed</strong>, especially for African Americans and women.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n57">Conclusion</h2>
        <p data-narration-id="n58">Roosevelt&rsquo;s New Deal was a turning point in American government. For the first time, the federal government took direct responsibility for citizens&rsquo; welfare &mdash; creating jobs, building infrastructure, and setting up a social safety net. It gave millions of Americans hope during the worst economic crisis in history. However, it did not end the Depression, and its benefits were uneven. The New Deal&rsquo;s lasting legacy was a permanent shift of power from the states to the federal government &mdash; and the principle that government must protect its people from economic disaster.</p>
        <h3 data-narration-id="n59">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n63">
          <li><strong>FDR&rsquo;s election (1932):</strong> Won 42 of 48 states. Promised a &lsquo;New Deal&rsquo; based on Relief, Recovery, and Reform. His &lsquo;Brain Trust&rsquo; of expert advisors designed the policies.</li>
          <li><strong>Alphabet agencies:</strong> CCC (3 million employed), TVA (21 dams), WPA (8.5 million employed). Total cost: $50.2 billion. Unemployment fell from 14 million to 7 million by 1937.</li>
          <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Did not end the Depression (WWII did). African Americans and women benefited less. The &lsquo;Roosevelt Recession&rsquo; (1937) saw unemployment jump back to 10 million after spending cuts.</li>

The Social Security Act created pensions and unemployment insurance for the first time. Alphabet agencies like the WPA employed 8.5 million people directly. The Wagner Act strengthened trade unions. This shifted power from states to Washington on a scale never seen before.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: The New Deal meant the federal government started helping ordinary people directly, for example through the FERA which gave $500 million in grants to states.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The government started doing more to help people.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Hoover\u2019s actions made the Depression worse. His belief in \u2018rugged individualism\u2019 meant he refused direct relief. His Hawley-Smoot Tariff (1930) cut international trade as other countries retaliated. His late measures \u2014 $400 million in building projects and the RFC ($1,500 million in loans to banks) \u2014 helped businesses, not ordinary people. The Bonus Army attack in 1932 \u2014 soldiers using tear gas and tanks against 20,000 veterans \u2014 destroyed his reputation. Roosevelt\u2019s actions had a far greater impact on relieving the Depression. His \u2018Hundred Days\u2019 produced 15 major laws. The Emergency Banking Act restored confidence. Alphabet agencies created millions of jobs: the CCC (3 million), WPA (8.5 million), and TVA (21 dams transforming the Tennessee Valley). The Social Security Act (1935) created pensions and unemployment insurance. Total spending was $50.2 billion. Unemployment fell from 14 million to 7 million by 1937. However, even Roosevelt did not end the Depression \u2014 the \u2018Roosevelt Recession\u2019 of 1937 saw unemployment rise back to 10 million when spending was cut. It was ultimately World War Two that ended the Depression. Roosevelt\u2019s impact was greater because he took decisive action that directly helped millions, while Hoover\u2019s inaction and mistakes deepened the crisis.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Hoover believed in rugged individualism and refused direct relief. The RFC helped banks, not people. The Bonus Army attack showed he was out of touch.\nExample (bullet 2): Roosevelt created the CCC, WPA, and TVA, putting millions back to work. The Social Security Act created a lasting safety net. He won the 1936 election carrying all but 2 states.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Roosevelt helped more because he created jobs through agencies like the CCC and WPA.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Hoover did not do much but Roosevelt tried to help.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: The alphabet agencies had an immediate, visible impact. The CCC employed 3 million young men in conservation work, paying $30 per month. The WPA was the largest agency, employing 8.5 million people and building 650,000 miles of roads, 125,000 buildings, and 8,000 parks. The TVA built 21 dams, bringing electricity and flood control to one of America\u2019s poorest regions. The PWA spent $6 billion on 34,000 projects. These agencies cut unemployment from 14 million to 7 million by 1937 and physically rebuilt America\u2019s infrastructure. However, the Social Security Act and Wagner Act had a longer-lasting impact. The Social Security Act (1935) created America\u2019s first welfare state \u2014 pensions for over-65s, unemployment insurance, and help for the disabled. This safety net still exists today. The Wagner Act gave workers the legal right to join unions and bargain collectively, increasing union membership from 3.7 million to 9 million by 1938. These laws permanently changed the relationship between government, workers, and employers. The alphabet agencies provided emergency relief, but the Social Security and Wagner Acts created structural changes that protected workers for decades to come.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): The CCC, WPA, and TVA directly employed millions and built lasting infrastructure. The TVA transformed the Tennessee Valley with 21 dams. Unemployment fell from 25% to 14% by 1937.\nExample (bullet 2): The Social Security Act created pensions and unemployment insurance for the first time. The Wagner Act helped union membership grow from 3.7 million to 9 million.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The WPA employed 8.5 million people and built roads, schools, and parks across America.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The New Deal agencies gave people jobs.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."
