        <h2>The Post-War Economic Boom</h2>

        <p>After World War Two ended in <strong>1945</strong>, the United States entered a period of extraordinary economic growth and prosperity. Unlike the boom of the 1920s, which had been built on shaky foundations, the post-war boom was sustained, widespread, and transformative. The USA emerged from the war as the world&rsquo;s dominant economic and military superpower.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Economic Dominance</div>
          <p>By the late 1940s, the USA produced over <strong>50% of the world&rsquo;s manufactured goods</strong>. The US economy grew by an average of <strong>3.5% per year</strong> throughout the late 1940s and 1950s. Between 1945 and 1960, the <strong>gross national product (GNP)</strong> doubled. Unemployment stayed below <strong>5%</strong> for most of the 1950s. Average family income rose by <strong>30%</strong> during the decade.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Why Did the Economy Boom?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wartime production:</strong> American factories had been running at full capacity during the war. After 1945, they switched from producing tanks and aircraft to producing cars, fridges, and televisions. Factories were modern, efficient, and ready to meet consumer demand.</li>
          <li><strong>Pent-up demand:</strong> During the war, many consumer goods had been rationed or unavailable. Americans had saved money during the war years and were now eager to spend it. Savings from wartime totalled around <strong>$140 billion</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Government spending:</strong> The federal government continued to spend heavily on defence during the Cold War, which kept factories busy and workers employed. Military spending alone accounted for around <strong>10% of GDP</strong> in the 1950s.</li>
          <li><strong>New technology:</strong> Wartime innovations were adapted for peacetime use. New products like <strong>televisions, synthetic materials, jet air travel, and plastics</strong> created entirely new industries and consumer markets.</li>
          <li><strong>Population growth:</strong> The &lsquo;baby boom&rsquo; (see below) created increased demand for housing, food, clothing, schools, and consumer goods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The GI Bill</h2>

        <p>The <strong>Servicemen&rsquo;s Readjustment Act of 1944</strong>, commonly known as the <strong>GI Bill</strong>, was one of the most significant pieces of legislation in American history. It provided returning World War Two veterans with a range of benefits designed to help them reintegrate into civilian life:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> The government paid tuition fees and living expenses for veterans attending college or vocational training. By 1947, veterans made up <strong>49% of all college admissions</strong>. By the time the original GI Bill expired, nearly <strong>8 million veterans</strong> had used it for education or training.</li>
          <li><strong>Home loans:</strong> The GI Bill provided <strong>low-interest, zero-deposit mortgages</strong>, making it possible for millions of veterans to buy homes for the first time. This drove the massive expansion of the suburbs.</li>
          <li><strong>Unemployment support:</strong> Veterans received <strong>$20 per week</strong> for up to a year while they looked for work.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The GI Bill&rsquo;s Impact</div>
          <p>The GI Bill created a better-educated, more prosperous generation. Before WWII, college education was mainly for the wealthy. The GI Bill opened higher education to millions of working-class and middle-class Americans, creating a larger, more skilled workforce. However, Black veterans often struggled to access GI Bill benefits fully due to discrimination &mdash; many colleges, especially in the South, refused to admit them, and banks sometimes refused mortgages to Black applicants in white neighbourhoods.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Baby Boom</h2>

        <p>When soldiers returned home after the war, the birth rate soared. Between <strong>1946 and 1964</strong>, approximately <strong>76 million babies</strong> were born in the United States &mdash; this generation became known as the <strong>&lsquo;baby boomers.&rsquo;</strong> The peak year was <strong>1957</strong>, when <strong>4.3 million</strong> babies were born.</p>

        <p>The baby boom had enormous economic and social effects. It created massive demand for housing, schools, children&rsquo;s products, and food. It fuelled suburban growth as families needed larger homes. And in the 1960s and 1970s, the baby boomers themselves would become a powerful cultural and political force.</p>

        <h2>Suburbia and Levittown</h2>

        <p>One of the most visible changes in post-war America was the rapid growth of <strong>suburbs</strong> &mdash; residential communities built on the outskirts of cities. The suburbs offered families affordable homes with gardens, good schools, and a safe, quiet environment away from the crowded, older inner cities.</p>

        <h3>Levittown</h3>
        <p>The most famous example of suburban development was <strong>Levittown</strong>, built by developer <strong>William Levitt</strong> on Long Island, New York, starting in <strong>1947</strong>. Levitt applied <strong>assembly-line techniques</strong> to house building &mdash; each house was identical and could be built in just <strong>16 minutes</strong> per stage of construction. Houses were affordable, starting at around <strong>$7,990</strong> (about $100,000 in today&rsquo;s money), and were snapped up by young families. Levittown eventually contained over <strong>17,000 homes</strong> and housed around <strong>82,000 people</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Suburban Growth</div>
          <p>By 1960, <strong>one-third of all Americans</strong> lived in suburbs. Suburban population grew by <strong>47%</strong> during the 1950s. However, the suburbs were overwhelmingly white. Levittown&rsquo;s original contracts explicitly <strong>banned the sale of homes to African Americans</strong>. This practice, known as <strong>&lsquo;redlining,&rsquo;</strong> meant that Black families were largely excluded from the suburban dream, trapped in overcrowded inner-city neighbourhoods with declining services and opportunities.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Consumer Culture</h2>

        <p>Post-war America saw an explosion of consumerism that dwarfed even the 1920s boom:</p>

        <h3>Television</h3>
        <p>Television became the defining technology of the era. In <strong>1945</strong>, fewer than <strong>10,000</strong> American homes had a TV set. By <strong>1960</strong>, that figure had risen to <strong>46 million</strong> &mdash; around <strong>90%</strong> of all homes. Television transformed entertainment, news, advertising, and politics. Advertising on TV drove consumer spending, promoting the latest cars, appliances, and fashions directly into American living rooms.</p>

        <h3>Car Culture</h3>
        <p>The car became central to the American way of life. By the mid-1950s, there were over <strong>60 million cars</strong> in the USA. The <strong>Interstate Highway Act of 1956</strong>, signed by President <strong>Eisenhower</strong>, authorised the construction of <strong>41,000 miles</strong> of interstate highways &mdash; the largest public works project in American history at the time. The highway system transformed American life, making suburban living practical and creating a culture built around the car.</p>

        <p>Car culture spawned new businesses: <strong>drive-in cinemas, drive-in restaurants (including the first McDonald&rsquo;s, which opened in 1955), shopping malls, and motels</strong> all catered to Americans on the move. <strong>Out-of-town shopping centres</strong> replaced traditional high streets, and the car became a symbol of freedom, status, and the American Dream.</p>

        <h3>Consumer Goods</h3>
        <p>Advertising, hire purchase (now called <strong>&lsquo;credit&rsquo;</strong>), and rising incomes meant Americans bought more than ever before. By the late 1950s, the average American family owned a <strong>car, a television, a washing machine, and a refrigerator</strong>. America consumed around <strong>one-third of the world&rsquo;s goods and services</strong>, despite having only <strong>6%</strong> of the world&rsquo;s population.</p>

        <h2>The Limits of Post-War Prosperity</h2>

            <span>Who was left behind?</span>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>African Americans:</strong> Despite contributing to the war effort, Black Americans returned to a country that still practised segregation, particularly in the South. They were excluded from many suburban developments, faced discrimination in employment and education, and continued to experience poverty at much higher rates than white Americans. In 1950, the average Black family income was <strong>54%</strong> of the average white family income.</p>
              <p><strong>Inner-city poverty:</strong> As wealthier white families moved to the suburbs (&lsquo;white flight&rsquo;), inner cities lost tax revenue, jobs, and services. The remaining population &mdash; disproportionately Black and Hispanic &mdash; faced declining schools, rising crime, and crumbling infrastructure.</p>
              <p><strong>Rural poverty:</strong> Not all Americans lived the suburban dream. In rural areas, particularly <strong>Appalachia</strong> and the Deep South, millions lived in severe poverty without adequate healthcare, education, or housing.</p>
              <p><strong>Conformity and discontent:</strong> The suburban lifestyle, while comfortable, was criticised for its <strong>conformity</strong> and materialism. Writers like <strong>Jack Kerouac</strong> (the Beat Generation) and sociologists questioned whether the &lsquo;American Dream&rsquo; was truly fulfilling, or simply creating a culture of shallow consumerism.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When writing about post-war America, show the examiner you understand the <strong>contrast</strong> between the image and the reality. While many Americans enjoyed unprecedented prosperity, the benefits were not shared equally. The suburbs were largely <strong>white-only spaces</strong>, African Americans faced ongoing discrimination, and inner cities declined. Strong answers will link the post-war boom to the <strong>civil rights movement</strong> &mdash; the prosperity made the inequality even more visible and unacceptable.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Post-war America experienced a remarkable economic boom that transformed the country. The GI Bill created an educated, home-owning middle class. The baby boom and suburban expansion reshaped the physical landscape. Television, cars, and consumer goods defined a new way of life. However, this prosperity was not shared by all. African Americans, inner-city residents, and rural communities were largely excluded from the suburban dream. The contrast between the image of affluent, white suburbia and the reality of continued racial inequality and poverty would fuel the social upheavals of the 1960s.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Economic superpower:</strong> The USA produced over 50% of the world&rsquo;s goods after WWII. GNP doubled between 1945 and 1960.</li>
          <li><strong>GI Bill:</strong> Gave nearly 8 million veterans education and training; created a new middle class through low-cost mortgages.</li>
          <li><strong>Suburban revolution:</strong> One-third of Americans lived in suburbs by 1960. Levittown symbolised affordable suburban living, but minorities were excluded.</li>
          <li><strong>Consumer culture:</strong> 90% of homes had TV by 1960. 60 million cars. Interstate Highway Act (1956) built 41,000 miles of highways.</li>
          <li><strong>Inequality persisted:</strong> Black family income was only 54% of white family income. Suburbs were largely whites-only. Inner cities declined.</li>
        </ul>
