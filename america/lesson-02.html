        <h2>What Was Prohibition?</h2>

        <p><strong>Prohibition</strong> was the ban on the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic drinks in the United States. It was introduced by the <strong>18th Amendment</strong> to the US Constitution in January 1919 and came into effect on <strong>17 January 1920</strong>. The <strong>Volstead Act</strong> (October 1919) defined the details of the law, making it illegal to produce, sell, or transport any drink containing more than <strong>0.5% alcohol</strong>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Legal Framework</div>
          <p>The <strong>18th Amendment</strong> (1919) made Prohibition part of the Constitution. The <strong>Volstead Act</strong> (1919) provided the enforcement rules. Together, they banned the manufacture, sale, and transportation of &lsquo;intoxicating liquors&rsquo; &mdash; but notably, it was <strong>never illegal to drink alcohol</strong>. People could still consume it; they just could not legally obtain it.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Was Prohibition Introduced?</h2>

        <p>The campaign for Prohibition had been growing for decades, driven by several powerful groups and arguments:</p>

        <h3>The Temperance Movement</h3>
        <p>Groups such as the <strong>Anti-Saloon League</strong> (founded 1893) and the <strong>Women&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union</strong> (WCTU) had campaigned against alcohol for years. They argued that alcohol destroyed families, caused domestic violence, and led to poverty. These organisations were well-funded, politically influential, and highly organised.</p>

        <h3>Religious and Moral Arguments</h3>
        <p>Many Protestant Christians, particularly in rural areas and the South, saw alcohol as sinful and immoral. They called saloons &lsquo;dens of vice&rsquo; and believed banning alcohol would create a more moral, God-fearing society. The campaign for Prohibition was often linked to wider moral reform movements.</p>

        <h3>Industrial Efficiency</h3>
        <p>Industrialists like <strong>Henry Ford</strong> and <strong>John D. Rockefeller</strong> supported Prohibition because they believed sober workers would be more productive and reliable. Fewer workplace accidents and less absenteeism meant higher profits.</p>

        <h3>Anti-German Sentiment</h3>
        <p>During World War One, many of America&rsquo;s largest breweries were owned by German-Americans (such as <strong>Anheuser-Busch</strong> and <strong>Pabst</strong>). Anti-German feeling during the war made it politically easier to target the brewing industry. Grain used for brewing could be redirected to the war effort.</p>

        <h2>How Was Prohibition Enforced?</h2>

        <p>Enforcement was the responsibility of <strong>Prohibition agents</strong>, but from the start the task was almost impossible:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Only around <strong>1,500 Prohibition agents</strong> were employed to police the entire country &mdash; a vast territory with <strong>18,700 miles</strong> of coastline and land borders.</li>
          <li>Agents were poorly paid (around <strong>$2,500 per year</strong>), making many vulnerable to bribery.</li>
          <li>In the first four years alone, <strong>1 in 12 agents</strong> were dismissed for corruption.</li>
          <li>Many state and local police forces were unwilling or unable to enforce the law, especially in large cities.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Eliot Ness</div>
          <p><strong>Eliot Ness</strong> was a young Prohibition agent in Chicago who led a team known as &lsquo;The Untouchables&rsquo; because they refused to accept bribes. They raided Al Capone&rsquo;s breweries and distilleries, but Ness&rsquo;s team was the exception rather than the rule &mdash; widespread corruption undermined enforcement across the country.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Breaking the Law: Bootlegging and Speakeasies</h2>

        <p>Rather than stopping people from drinking, Prohibition drove the alcohol trade underground and created a massive illegal industry:</p>

        <h3>Bootlegging</h3>
        <p><strong>Bootleggers</strong> were people who illegally manufactured, transported, or sold alcohol. Alcohol was smuggled across the border from <strong>Canada</strong> and <strong>Mexico</strong>, or brought in by ship from the Caribbean (a practice called <strong>&lsquo;rum running&rsquo;</strong>). Others produced &lsquo;moonshine&rsquo; &mdash; homemade spirits often brewed in bathtubs or hidden stills. Some of this was extremely dangerous; badly made alcohol caused blindness and even death. An estimated <strong>10,000 people</strong> died from drinking poisonous bootleg liquor during Prohibition.</p>

        <h3>Speakeasies</h3>
        <p><strong>Speakeasies</strong> were illegal bars and drinking clubs that sprang up across America. By 1930, there were an estimated <strong>200,000 speakeasies</strong> in the United States &mdash; in New York City alone, there may have been <strong>30,000</strong>, more than double the number of legal bars before Prohibition. The name &lsquo;speakeasy&rsquo; came from the practice of speaking quietly (&lsquo;easy&rsquo;) about the location to avoid detection. Many were hidden behind secret doors, in basements, or disguised as shops.</p>

        <h2>The Rise of Organised Crime</h2>

        <p>Prohibition created an enormous opportunity for <strong>organised crime</strong>. Criminal gangs took control of the illegal alcohol trade, making vast fortunes and wielding enormous power.</p>

        <h3>Al Capone</h3>
        <p><strong>Alphonse &lsquo;Al&rsquo; Capone</strong> was the most notorious gangster of the Prohibition era. Based in <strong>Chicago</strong>, he controlled a criminal empire that earned an estimated <strong>$60 million a year</strong> from bootlegging alone (equivalent to over $1 billion today). Capone also ran gambling dens, brothels, and protection rackets.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Al Capone&rsquo;s Power</div>
          <p>Capone controlled much of Chicago through a combination of <strong>bribery and violence</strong>. He had judges, police officers, and politicians on his payroll. It is estimated he bribed officials with around <strong>$75 million</strong> during his criminal career. Despite being responsible for numerous murders, Capone was eventually convicted in <strong>1931</strong> &mdash; not for murder or bootlegging, but for <strong>tax evasion</strong>. He was sentenced to <strong>11 years</strong> in federal prison.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The St Valentine&rsquo;s Day Massacre</h3>
        <p>The most infamous act of gang violence during Prohibition was the <strong>St Valentine&rsquo;s Day Massacre</strong> on <strong>14 February 1929</strong>. Gunmen, believed to be working for Al Capone, dressed as police officers and executed <strong>seven members</strong> of the rival <strong>Bugs Moran</strong> gang in a garage on Chicago&rsquo;s North Clark Street. The massacre shocked the nation and highlighted the extreme violence that Prohibition had unleashed. Although Capone was widely believed to have ordered the killings, he was in Florida at the time and was never charged.</p>

        <h3>Gang Wars and Violence</h3>
        <p>Chicago was not the only city affected. Gang warfare over control of the bootlegging trade caused <strong>hundreds of murders</strong> across American cities. In Chicago alone, there were over <strong>500 gang-related murders</strong> between 1927 and 1930. Corruption was rampant &mdash; in many cities, the police and politicians were on the gangsters&rsquo; payroll.</p>

        <h2>Why Did Prohibition Fail?</h2>

        <p>By the late 1920s, it was clear that Prohibition was not working. Several factors explain its failure:</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Reasons for Prohibition&rsquo;s failure</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Impossible to enforce:</strong> The USA was simply too large. With thousands of miles of borders and coastline, and only 1,500 agents, there was no way to stop the flow of illegal alcohol.</p>
              <p><strong>Widespread disregard for the law:</strong> Millions of ordinary Americans continued to drink. Many saw Prohibition as an unreasonable restriction on their personal freedom. Even some politicians and judges drank illegally.</p>
              <p><strong>Corruption:</strong> Low-paid Prohibition agents, police officers, judges, and politicians were easily bribed by gangsters. In some cities, the criminal underworld and the authorities were virtually indistinguishable.</p>
              <p><strong>Organised crime:</strong> Rather than eliminating alcohol, Prohibition handed control of the drinks trade to violent criminals who made enormous profits. The gangs became more powerful and more dangerous as a result.</p>
              <p><strong>Loss of tax revenue:</strong> Before Prohibition, the government had collected significant tax revenue from the legal alcohol industry. This was now lost, while the cost of enforcement drained public funds.</p>
              <p><strong>The Great Depression:</strong> After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, ending Prohibition became an economic argument too &mdash; legalising alcohol would create jobs and generate tax revenue that the struggling government desperately needed.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The End of Prohibition</h2>

        <p>In the <strong>1932 presidential election</strong>, <strong>Franklin D. Roosevelt</strong> campaigned on a promise to end Prohibition. After his landslide victory, the <strong>21st Amendment</strong> was ratified on <strong>5 December 1933</strong>, repealing the 18th Amendment and ending Prohibition after nearly 14 years. It remains the only time a Constitutional Amendment has been repealed by another Amendment.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The 21st Amendment</div>
          <p>The <strong>21st Amendment</strong> (1933) repealed Prohibition. Roosevelt reportedly said: &lsquo;I think this would be a good time for a beer.&rsquo; The end of Prohibition created jobs, generated tax revenue, and removed a major source of income from organised crime &mdash; though criminal gangs simply moved into other illegal activities such as drugs and gambling.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Questions about Prohibition often ask you to explain <strong>why it was introduced</strong> or <strong>why it failed</strong>. Make sure you can give multiple reasons for each, with specific evidence. For a top-level answer, explain how the reasons are <strong>linked</strong> &mdash; for example, the impossibility of enforcement led to widespread law-breaking, which created the opportunity for organised crime, which in turn corrupted the very officials meant to enforce the law.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Prohibition was one of the most dramatic social experiments in American history, and it is widely regarded as a failure. While it was introduced with genuine moral intentions, it proved impossible to enforce, led to the rise of powerful criminal organisations, corrupted law enforcement, and was widely ignored by the American public. Rather than creating a sober, moral society, Prohibition demonstrated the limits of using legislation to change deep-rooted social behaviour.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Good intentions, disastrous results:</strong> Prohibition was supported by sincere moral, religious, and economic arguments, but its consequences &mdash; organised crime, corruption, and widespread law-breaking &mdash; were far worse than the problems it sought to solve.</li>
          <li><strong>Al Capone and organised crime:</strong> The illegal alcohol trade made gangsters like Capone incredibly wealthy and powerful, with criminal empires that corrupted police, judges, and politicians.</li>
          <li><strong>The 21st Amendment:</strong> Prohibition was repealed in 1933, the only time a Constitutional Amendment has been undone. Its failure showed that laws are only effective when they have broad public support.</li>
        </ul>
