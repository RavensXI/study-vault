        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">A Cultural Revolution</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">The 1920s were not just an economic boom &mdash; they were a <strong>cultural revolution</strong>. Cinema, jazz, radio, and spectator sports created a shared national culture for the first time. Changing attitudes gave women new freedoms. These shifts earned the decade its famous nickname: the <strong>&lsquo;Roaring Twenties.&rsquo;</strong></p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n3">The Growth of Cinema</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">Cinema became the most popular form of entertainment in 1920s America. By the end of the decade, about <strong>100 million Americans</strong> &mdash; out of a population of 123 million &mdash; went to the cinema every week. Almost every person in the country was visiting a movie theatre weekly.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n5">Hollywood and the Studio System</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n6"><strong>Hollywood</strong>, in Los Angeles, became the centre of the American film industry. Major studios like <strong>Paramount, MGM, Warner Bros., and Universal</strong> turned out around <strong>500 films a year</strong> by 1929. The sunny Californian climate was ideal for filming, and the studios built vast lots to make movies on an almost industrial scale.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">Most of the decade was the era of <strong>silent films</strong>. Stars like <strong>Charlie Chaplin</strong>, <strong>Buster Keaton</strong>, <strong>Mary Pickford</strong>, and <strong>Rudolph Valentino</strong> became household names. <strong>Clara Bow</strong>, known as the <strong>&lsquo;It Girl,&rsquo;</strong> became the flapper icon on screen &mdash; her image of fun, freedom, and sex appeal defined 1920s glamour. Audiences did not need to understand English to enjoy silent films, making cinema a truly <dfn class="term" data-def="Having wide appeal across different groups of people, regardless of background, class, or language.">universal</dfn> form of entertainment.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n8">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Jazz Singer (1927)</div>
          <p>In <strong>October 1927</strong>, Warner Bros. released <strong><em>The Jazz Singer</em></strong>, the first major film with synchronised dialogue &mdash; a <strong>&lsquo;talkie.&rsquo;</strong> Starring <strong>Al Jolson</strong>, it was a sensation. It ended the silent era and launched modern cinema. Within two years, virtually all films were &lsquo;talkies.&rsquo;</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">The Impact of Cinema on American Culture</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n10">Cinema shaped how Americans thought and behaved. Films spread new fashions, hairstyles, and attitudes across the country. A woman in small-town Kansas could see the same film as a woman in New York and copy the same style. Cinema helped create a <strong>shared national culture</strong>, breaking down rural isolation.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">Movie stars became <dfn class="term" data-def="Famous people who are widely admired and imitated, often influencing fashion, behaviour, and values.">celebrities</dfn> on a scale never seen before. Fans copied their clothes, hair, and mannerisms. Cinema also promoted <strong>consumerism</strong> &mdash; audiences saw characters using the latest products and wanted them. However, not everyone approved. The <strong>Hays Code</strong> set moral guidelines for films &mdash; no kiss longer than 3 seconds, no nudity, and clergy could not be shown as villains. The Code showed the tension between modern culture and traditional values.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n12">Jazz and the Jazz Age</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n13"><strong>Jazz music</strong> was the soundtrack of the 1920s &mdash; energetic, improvisational, and exciting. The decade became known as the <strong>&lsquo;Jazz Age,&rsquo;</strong> a term coined by the writer <strong>F. Scott Fitzgerald</strong>.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n14">Origins in African American Communities</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n15">Jazz grew out of <strong>African American</strong> musical traditions in the South, especially <strong>New Orleans</strong>. It blended <dfn class="term" data-def="A style of music that originated among African Americans in the Deep South, characterised by its sad, soulful sound and use of &lsquo;blue notes.&rsquo;">blues</dfn>, <dfn class="term" data-def="A type of music with a syncopated (off-beat) rhythm, popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.">ragtime</dfn>, and <strong>spirituals</strong> &mdash; music rooted in the experience of slavery, hardship, and resilience.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n16">During the <strong>Great Migration</strong>, hundreds of thousands of African Americans moved from the rural South to northern cities. They brought jazz with them. <strong>Chicago</strong>, <strong>New York</strong>, and <strong>Kansas City</strong> became major jazz centres, with clubs playing the new music night after night.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n17">Key Jazz Figures</h3>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n18">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Louis Armstrong</div>
          <p><strong>Louis Armstrong</strong> was the most important jazz musician of the 1920s. Born in New Orleans, he moved to Chicago and became famous for his trumpet playing and warm, gravelly voice. Armstrong proved jazz was a serious art form, not just dance music. He was one of the first African American entertainers to win a large white audience.</p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">Other key figures included <strong>Duke Ellington</strong>, whose orchestra performed at the famous <strong>Cotton Club</strong> in Harlem, and <strong>Bessie Smith</strong>, the &lsquo;Empress of the Blues,&rsquo; one of the highest-paid Black performers in America. <strong>Josephine Baker</strong> became a major Jazz Age entertainer, famous for her daring dance performances &mdash; though she found greater acceptance in Paris than in segregated America. White musicians like <strong>Bix Beiderbecke</strong> also played jazz, showing the music was crossing racial lines.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n20">Jazz and Controversy</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n21">Not everyone welcomed jazz. Older, conservative Americans &mdash; especially in rural areas and the South &mdash; saw it as <strong>immoral, dangerous, and corrupting</strong>. They linked it to drinking, dancing, and racial mixing. Some called it &lsquo;the devil&rsquo;s music.&rsquo; This clash between modern, urban culture and traditional, rural values was one of the defining conflicts of the 1920s.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n22">The Harlem Renaissance</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">Jazz was part of a wider flowering of <strong>African American art, literature, and culture</strong> called the <strong>Harlem Renaissance</strong>. <dfn class="term" data-def="A neighbourhood in New York City that became the cultural capital of Black America in the 1920s, home to writers, musicians, artists, and intellectuals.">Harlem</dfn>, in New York City, became the centre of Black cultural life in America.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">Writers like <strong>Langston Hughes</strong> and <strong>Zora Neale Hurston</strong> explored the African American experience in poetry and novels. Artists, musicians, and intellectuals built a powerful sense of <strong>Black pride and identity</strong>. The Harlem Renaissance challenged racist stereotypes and showed African Americans making vital contributions to American culture &mdash; even as they still faced severe discrimination.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n25">Radio: A New Mass Medium</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n26">The <strong>radio</strong> transformed entertainment and culture. The first commercial station, <strong>KDKA</strong> in Pittsburgh, began broadcasting in <strong>November 1920</strong>. By 1929, over <strong>10 million radios</strong> sat in American homes.</p>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n27">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Radio&rsquo;s Reach</div>
          <p>Radio brought music, news, comedy, drama, and sports into people&rsquo;s homes for the first time. Families gathered around the radio each evening. By 1929, the <strong>National Broadcasting Company (NBC)</strong> was reaching a nationwide audience, helping create a <strong>shared American culture</strong> across regional and class lines.</p>
        </div>

        <p data-narration-id="n28">Radio also drove <strong>advertising</strong> and <strong>consumerism</strong>. Companies sponsored programmes, and adverts reached millions. Radio helped jazz spread far beyond the cities &mdash; a farmer in Iowa could now hear the same music as a city-dweller in Chicago.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n29">Spectator Sports</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n30">The 1920s were a <strong>golden age of American sport</strong>. Rising incomes, more leisure time, and the growth of radio turned sport into mass entertainment.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n31"><strong>Baseball</strong> was America&rsquo;s favourite sport. <strong>Babe Ruth</strong>, playing for the <strong>New York Yankees</strong>, hit a record <strong>60 home runs</strong> in 1927. He earned <strong>$80,000 a year</strong> &mdash; more than the President. Ruth was one of the first true sporting celebrities.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n32"><strong>Boxing</strong> was the other great spectator sport. <strong>Jack Dempsey</strong>, the heavyweight champion, drew huge crowds. His 1921 fight against Georges Carpentier was the first event to earn over <strong>$1 million</strong> in ticket sales. About <strong>300,000 people</strong> listened on radio &mdash; one of the first live sports broadcasts.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n33">These sporting heroes became symbols of a confident, modern America. Sport, like cinema and jazz, built a sense of <strong>national identity and shared experience</strong>.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n34">A New, Modern Society</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n35">Cinema, jazz, radio, and sport together marked a huge shift in American society. For the first time, people across the country shared the same entertainment, music, and heroes. Urban, modern values spread outward from the cities, clashing with the more traditional, religious values of rural America. This tension &mdash; between the <strong>old America</strong> and the <strong>new</strong> &mdash; is a key theme for the exam.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n36">Women Before the 1920s</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n37">Before World War One, most American women&rsquo;s lives centred on the home. Middle-class women were expected to be wives and mothers, dress modestly, and avoid public life. Women could not vote in federal elections, had limited access to education, and very few held professional jobs.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n38">The Impact of World War One</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n39">The war changed things fast. With millions of men away fighting, women filled jobs in factories, offices, and farms. By 1918, around <strong>1 million women</strong> had entered new roles. This gave many women independence and confidence, and it became harder to argue they were incapable of working or taking part in public life.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n40">The 19th Amendment: Women&rsquo;s Suffrage</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n41">The <strong>19th Amendment</strong> was ratified on <strong>18 August 1920</strong>, granting women the right to vote in all elections. It capped decades of campaigning by activists like <strong>Susan B. Anthony</strong>, <strong>Elizabeth Cady Stanton</strong>, and <strong>Alice Paul</strong>.</p>

          <p>The 19th Amendment stated: &lsquo;The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.&rsquo; In practice, many African American women (and men) in the South were still blocked from voting by <dfn class="term" data-def="A tax that had to be paid before a person could vote.">poll taxes</dfn>, <dfn class="term" data-def="A test of reading or writing ability that had to be passed before a person could vote.">literacy tests</dfn>, and intimidation.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n43">The Flappers</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n44">The most visible symbol of changing women&rsquo;s roles was the <strong><dfn class="term" data-def="A young, fashionable woman in the 1920s who challenged traditional expectations by wearing short skirts, bobbing her hair, listening to jazz, and behaving in ways considered &lsquo;unladylike.&rsquo;">flapper</dfn></strong>. Flappers were young, fashionable women &mdash; mainly white, middle-class, and urban &mdash; who deliberately broke the rules about how women should look and behave. They were tied to the new jazz culture: dancing in nightclubs and speakeasies, part of the same modern world as cinema and radio.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n45">How Did Flappers Challenge Convention?</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n70">
          <li data-narration-id="n46"><strong>Fashion:</strong> Flappers wore short skirts (knee-length &mdash; scandalous at the time), bobbed their hair, and used make-up in public. They rejected the modest clothing of previous generations.</li>
          <li data-narration-id="n47"><strong>Behaviour:</strong> They smoked in public, drank at <dfn class="term" data-def="Illegal bars that operated secretly during Prohibition.">speakeasies</dfn>, danced to jazz, and drove cars. They went out without chaperones and socialised freely with men.</li>
          <li data-narration-id="n48"><strong>Attitudes:</strong> Flappers rejected the idea that a woman&rsquo;s only role was wife and mother. They embraced fun, leisure, and personal choice.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact" data-narration-id="n49">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Jazz and the Flappers</div>
          <p>Jazz music became the soundtrack of the flapper lifestyle. Dances like the <strong>Charleston</strong> and the <strong>Black Bottom</strong> shocked older generations. Flappers flocked to dance halls and jazz clubs, making the music central to 1920s youth culture.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n50">Wider Changes for Women</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n51">Changes in women&rsquo;s lives went beyond the flapper image:</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n52">Employment</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n53">Women in employment rose by <strong>25%</strong> during the 1920s, reaching about <strong>10.6 million</strong> by 1929. Office work created new roles &mdash; secretaries, typists, telephone operators, shop assistants. But women were still paid less than men, and most professional careers stayed closed to them.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n54">New Technology in the Home</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n55"><strong>Vacuum cleaners, washing machines, and refrigerators</strong> cut the time women spent on housework, freeing time for leisure, education, or paid work. But these devices were expensive and only wealthier families could afford them.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n56">Birth Control</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n57"><strong>Margaret Sanger</strong> campaigned for women&rsquo;s access to birth control. She opened the first <strong>birth control clinic</strong> in 1916 and founded the <strong>American Birth Control League</strong> in 1921. Contraception gave some women greater control over family size, though it stayed controversial and many states restricted access.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n58">Education</h3>
        <p data-narration-id="n59">By 1928, there were <strong>10 times</strong> as many female college students as in 1900. Education opened new career paths and gave women greater economic independence.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n60">Limits of Change</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n61">Do not overstate the changes. The flapper lifestyle was experienced by only a <strong>small minority</strong> of women:</p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p data-narration-id="n62"><strong>Rural vs Urban:</strong> The flapper trend was mainly urban and middle-class. In <strong>rural areas</strong>, traditional values dominated. Only about <strong>1 in 4 women</strong> worked outside the home.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n63"><strong>Race:</strong> African American, Hispanic, and immigrant women saw far fewer benefits. Most were confined to low-paid domestic or farm work. <strong>African American women</strong> in the South faced both racial segregation and gender inequality.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n64"><strong>Class:</strong> The flapper lifestyle needed money. Working-class women could not afford fashionable clothes, dance halls, or new goods. Many worked long hours for low pay.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n65"><strong>Political impact:</strong> Despite the vote, women did not vote as a bloc. Very few were elected to office. The political establishment stayed overwhelmingly male.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n66"><strong>Backlash:</strong> Many Americans &mdash; especially in rural, religious communities &mdash; opposed the changes. Religious leaders condemned flapper behaviour as sinful. Some states even tried to restrict hemline lengths by law. Even some younger women pushed back &mdash; the <strong>Anti-Flirt Club</strong>, founded in Washington D.C. in 1923, campaigned against the bold behaviour associated with flappers.</p>

        <p>This lesson covers <strong>two AQA spec points</strong>: entertainment (cinema, jazz) and the position of women (flappers). For top marks, show how they <strong>connect</strong> &mdash; flappers were part of the new entertainment culture, and cinema spread new ideas about women nationwide. Always discuss <strong>both change and its limits</strong>: who experienced the new culture, and who was excluded by geography, race, or class?</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion" data-narration-id="n69">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1920s brought a cultural revolution. Cinema became a mass industry centred on Hollywood. Jazz &mdash; rooted in African American communities &mdash; defined the decade and fuelled a vibrant nightlife. Radio reached millions of homes, and spectator sports created national heroes. Women gained the vote and some challenged traditional roles through the flapper movement. But these changes were not shared equally &mdash; they were concentrated among urban, white, middle-class Americans, while rural communities, African Americans, and the working class often saw little change.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n71">
          <li><strong>A shared national culture:</strong> Cinema, jazz, radio, and sport broke down regional isolation but created tension between modern and traditional values.</li>
          <li><strong>African American cultural contribution:</strong> Jazz and the Harlem Renaissance showed the creativity of African American culture, even as Black Americans faced ongoing discrimination.</li>
          <li><strong>Women&rsquo;s progress was real but limited:</strong> The 19th Amendment and flappers brought genuine change, but most women &mdash; especially those who were rural, Black, or working-class &mdash; saw little improvement.</li>

Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which new forms of entertainment transformed American culture.\nExample: Cinema became a mass industry. By the end of the 1920s, about 100 million Americans went to the cinema every week. Hollywood studios like Paramount and MGM produced around 500 films a year, and stars like Charlie Chaplin and Clara Bow became household names, shaping fashion and behaviour across the country.\n\nAnother example: Radio transformed home entertainment. The first commercial station, KDKA in Pittsburgh, began broadcasting in November 1920, and by 1929 over 10 million radios were in American homes. Families gathered around the radio each evening, and NBC reached a nationwide audience, creating a shared culture across regional and class lines.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: Entertainment developments transformed American culture but affected different groups in different ways. Cinema became a truly mass medium \u2014 100 million Americans visited movie theatres weekly by the late 1920s. Films spread new fashions and attitudes nationwide, helping create a shared national culture that broke down rural isolation. The 1927 film The Jazz Singer ended the silent era and launched modern cinema. Jazz, rooted in African American communities in New Orleans, defined the decade. Louis Armstrong proved jazz was a serious art form and became one of the first Black entertainers with a large white audience. The Harlem Renaissance celebrated Black culture through art and literature. However, entertainment also deepened cultural divisions: conservative rural Americans saw jazz as immoral and linked it to racial mixing, while the Hays Code tried to control cinema content. African American performers like Josephine Baker found greater acceptance in Paris than in segregated America.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Cinema shaped American culture. By the late 1920s, 100 million people went weekly, and stars like Clara Bow influenced fashion nationwide. Radio also had a huge impact \u2014 by 1929 over 10 million radios were in homes, and NBC reached a national audience, helping create a shared American culture.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: Jazz music was popular in the 1920s. Louis Armstrong was famous for his trumpet playing and helped make jazz a respected art form.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: People listened to jazz and went to the cinema.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: Women\u2019s lives changed significantly but unevenly. The 19th Amendment (1920) gave women the vote, a major political milestone after decades of campaigning. In employment, the number of working women rose by 25% to about 10.6 million by 1929, with new roles in offices as secretaries and typists. Flappers challenged social conventions \u2014 wearing short skirts, bobbing their hair, and dancing the Charleston in jazz clubs. Margaret Sanger\u2019s birth control campaign gave some women greater control over family size. However, these changes mainly affected white, urban, middle-class women. Only 1 in 4 women worked outside the home, and most were paid less than men. African American and immigrant women remained confined to low-paid domestic or farm work. In rural areas, traditional values dominated, and the Anti-Flirt Club (1923) showed backlash even among younger women.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Women gained the vote through the 19th Amendment in 1920. This was a major change after decades of campaigning. Also, women in employment rose by 25%, with new office jobs available. But women were still paid less than men and most professional careers remained closed to them.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: Flappers changed how women behaved in the 1920s. They wore short skirts, smoked in public, and went to jazz clubs, breaking traditional rules about how women should act.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s).

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Cinema, radio, and jazz were all interconnected and together created a cultural revolution, but cinema and radio arguably had the wider impact. By the late 1920s, 100 million Americans visited cinemas weekly \u2014 almost the entire population. Films spread fashions, values, and a consumer lifestyle nationwide, breaking down regional isolation. The Jazz Singer (1927) launched the \u2018talkie\u2019 era. Radio reached over 10 million homes by 1929, with NBC creating the first national broadcast audience. Together, cinema and radio touched virtually every American. Jazz, however, had a unique cultural significance. It was rooted in African American traditions from New Orleans and became the soundtrack of the decade. Louis Armstrong proved it was a serious art form, and the Harlem Renaissance celebrated wider Black cultural achievements. Jazz fuelled the flapper lifestyle and nightclub culture. But jazz also exposed deep divisions \u2014 conservative rural Americans saw it as immoral and linked it to racial mixing. Cinema and radio reached more people, but jazz had the deeper cultural meaning as it challenged racial attitudes and defined youth culture.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Cinema and radio created a shared national culture. About 100 million Americans went to the cinema weekly, and films shaped fashion and attitudes. By 1929, over 10 million radios were in homes, allowing families across the country to hear the same programmes.\nExample (bullet 2): Jazz defined the decade. Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington became famous, and jazz clubs were central to the new urban nightlife. The Harlem Renaissance showed African American cultural achievement.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both had significance but in different ways. The 19th Amendment (ratified August 1920) was a landmark legal change, giving all American women the right to vote for the first time. It ended decades of campaigning by Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Alice Paul. However, its practical impact was limited \u2014 women did not vote as a bloc, very few were elected to office, and African American women in the South were still blocked by poll taxes and literacy tests. The flapper movement had a more visible social impact: young women cut their hair, wore shorter skirts, smoked, drank at speakeasies, and danced the Charleston. This challenged deep-rooted expectations about women\u2019s behaviour. Yet flappers were mainly white, urban, and middle-class \u2014 only a small minority. In rural areas, traditional values still dominated. The 19th Amendment was arguably more significant because it was a permanent, constitutional change that applied to all women, even if its effects were slow to materialise. The flapper movement was dramatic but limited in scope.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): The 19th Amendment gave all women the right to vote for the first time.

But the flapper lifestyle was mainly experienced by white, urban, middle-class women \u2014 only about 1 in 4 women worked outside the home.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The 19th Amendment was important because it gave women the vote in 1920.
