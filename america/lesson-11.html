        <h2>Segregation and Jim Crow Laws</h2>

        <p>By the 1940s, African Americans &mdash; especially in the <strong>Southern states</strong> &mdash; faced racial discrimination enforced by law. The <dfn class="term" data-def="State and local laws enacted in the Southern United States from the 1870s onwards that enforced racial segregation in all public facilities, including schools, transport, restaurants, and drinking fountains. They were named after a racist minstrel character.">Jim Crow laws</dfn> had been in place since the late 19th century. They created a system of <strong>legal segregation</strong> that touched every part of daily life.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Jim Crow Segregation</div>
          <p>Jim Crow laws separated Black and white Americans in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Schools</strong> &mdash; separate (and usually inferior) schools for Black children</li>
            <li><strong>Transport</strong> &mdash; separate seating on buses, trains, and waiting rooms</li>
            <li><strong>Public facilities</strong> &mdash; separate drinking fountains, restrooms, and parks</li>
            <li><strong>Restaurants and theatres</strong> &mdash; Black people were barred or forced into designated areas</li>
            <li><strong>Voting</strong> &mdash; literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses stopped Black Americans from voting</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>In 1896, the Supreme Court ruling in <strong>Plessy v. Ferguson</strong> established the doctrine of <dfn class="term" data-def="The legal doctrine established by the 1896 Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson, which ruled that racial segregation was constitutional as long as the separate facilities provided for Black and white people were of equal quality. In practice, facilities for Black Americans were almost always vastly inferior.">&ldquo;separate but equal,&rdquo;</dfn> declaring segregation constitutional as long as facilities were equal. In reality, facilities for Black Americans were almost always <strong>vastly inferior</strong> &mdash; schools underfunded, hospitals poorly equipped, opportunities severely limited.</p>

        <h3>Violence and Intimidation</h3>

        <p>Segregation was enforced not just by law but by <strong>violence and terror</strong>. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A white supremacist hate group founded in 1865 that used violence, lynching, and intimidation to terrorise Black Americans and prevent them from exercising their rights. The Klan experienced a major revival in the 1920s and continued to operate through the civil rights era.">Ku Klux Klan (KKK)</dfn> terrorised Black communities through lynchings, bombings, and arson. Between 1882 and 1968, over <strong>4,700 people</strong> were lynched in the United States, the vast majority Black men. Police and courts often turned a blind eye, and killers were rarely punished.</p>

        <h2>The Murder of Emmett Till (1955)</h2>

        <p><strong>Emmett Till</strong> was a <strong>14-year-old Black boy</strong> from Chicago visiting relatives in Mississippi in the summer of 1955. He allegedly whistled at a white woman, <strong>Carolyn Bryant</strong>, in a grocery store. Days later, her husband <strong>Roy Bryant</strong> and his half-brother <strong>J.W. Milam</strong> kidnapped Emmett from his great-uncle&rsquo;s home. They beat him brutally, shot him, and dumped his body in the Tallahatchie River.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Emmett Till</div>
          <p>Emmett&rsquo;s mother, <strong>Mamie Till</strong>, insisted on an <strong>open-casket funeral</strong> so the world could see what had been done to her son. Photos of his mutilated body were published in <em>Jet</em> magazine and shocked the nation. Despite overwhelming evidence, the <strong>all-white jury acquitted Bryant and Milam in just 67 minutes</strong>. The case became a catalyst for the civil rights movement &mdash; thousands of Americans, Black and white, were outraged and galvanised into action.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Impact of World War Two</h2>

        <p>World War Two (1939&ndash;1945) was a turning point for civil rights. The war exposed the hypocrisy of fighting for freedom abroad while tolerating racial oppression at home.</p>

The <strong>Tuskegee Airmen</strong> &mdash; an all-Black fighter pilot squadron &mdash; excelled in combat and challenged racist assumptions.</p>
              <p><strong>The Double V Campaign:</strong> The <em>Pittsburgh Courier</em> launched the <dfn class="term" data-def="A campaign launched by the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper in 1942, calling for African Americans to fight for a double victory: victory against fascism abroad in World War Two, and victory against racism at home in the United States.">&ldquo;Double V&rdquo; campaign</dfn> in 1942 &mdash; victory against fascism abroad and victory against racism at home.</p>
              <p><strong>Economic opportunities:</strong> The wartime boom drew hundreds of thousands of Black Americans to Northern and Western factories during the <dfn class="term" data-def="The large-scale migration of over 6 million African Americans from the rural Southern states to cities in the North, Midwest, and West between 1910 and 1970, driven by the search for better economic opportunities and escape from Jim Crow segregation.">Great Migration</dfn>. Even in the North, however, Black workers were usually given the <strong>lowest-paid jobs</strong> and were <strong>the first to be laid off</strong> during downturns. In 1941, <strong>A. Philip Randolph</strong> threatened a march on Washington to demand fair employment. Roosevelt responded with <strong>Executive Order 8802</strong>, banning racial discrimination in the defence industry &mdash; the first federal civil rights action since Reconstruction.</p>
              <p><strong>Truman desegregates the military:</strong> In <strong>1948</strong>, President Truman signed <strong>Executive Order 9981</strong>, desegregating the US armed forces. This was a major early federal civil rights action, showing the growing political pressure for change.</p>
              <p><strong>Returning veterans:</strong> Black veterans came home expecting the freedoms they had fought for. Instead, they faced the same Jim Crow discrimination. This injustice radicalised many and swelled the ranks of civil rights groups.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The NAACP and Legal Challenges</h2>

        <p>The <dfn class="term" data-def="The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, founded in 1909. It became the leading civil rights organisation, using legal challenges in the courts to overturn segregation laws. Its Legal Defense Fund, led by Thurgood Marshall, won several landmark Supreme Court cases.">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)</dfn>, founded in 1909, was the leading civil rights organisation. For decades, the NAACP campaigned for the federal government to pass anti-lynching laws and protect Black voting rights. But the government <strong>refused to act</strong> &mdash; it did not want a fight with powerful Southern politicians over <dfn class="term" data-def="The argument that individual states, not the federal government, should have the final say over laws within their borders. Southern politicians used states&rsquo; rights to defend segregation and resist federal civil rights measures.">&ldquo;states&rsquo; rights.&rdquo;</dfn> The NAACP&rsquo;s strategy therefore shifted towards using the <strong>legal system</strong> to challenge segregation, bringing carefully chosen test cases to court.</p>

        <p>The NAACP&rsquo;s chief lawyer, <strong>Thurgood Marshall</strong>, led a series of legal victories in the 1940s and 1950s that chipped away at &ldquo;separate but equal.&rdquo; Marshall later became the first African American Supreme Court Justice in 1967.</p>

        <h2>Brown v. Board of Education (1954)</h2>

        <p>The biggest legal victory came on <strong>17 May 1954</strong>, when the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in <dfn class="term" data-def="A landmark 1954 Supreme Court case in which the court ruled unanimously that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, overturning the 'separate but equal' doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. The case was brought on behalf of Linda Brown, a Black girl denied entry to her local all-white school in Topeka, Kansas.">Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</dfn>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Brown v. Board of Education</div>
          <p>The case was brought by <strong>Oliver Brown</strong> on behalf of his daughter <strong>Linda</strong>, denied entry to her local all-white school in Topeka, Kansas. She had to travel a long way to reach a segregated Black school. Chief Justice <strong>Earl Warren</strong> declared that <em>&ldquo;separate educational facilities are inherently unequal&rdquo;</em> &mdash; violating the 14th Amendment. This overturned <strong>Plessy v. Ferguson</strong> after 58 years.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Significance and Limitations</h3>

        <p>Brown was a <strong>landmark moment</strong>. It established that segregation was unconstitutional and gave the movement huge moral and legal force. But the ruling had serious limits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Supreme Court set <strong>no deadline</strong>, saying only that desegregation should happen &ldquo;with all deliberate speed&rdquo;</li>
          <li>Many Southern states <strong>refused to comply</strong> &mdash; over 100 Southern congressmen signed the &ldquo;Southern Manifesto&rdquo; pledging resistance</li>
          <li><strong>White Citizens&rsquo; Councils</strong> formed across the South to fight integration. They had around <strong>250,000 members</strong> and used economic pressure &mdash; such as sacking workers and refusing loans &mdash; to punish anyone who supported desegregation</li>
          <li>By 1957, <strong>not a single Black child</strong> attended an integrated school in Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, or South Carolina</li>
          <li>The ruling only applied to <strong>schools</strong>, not other areas of segregation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Little Rock Nine (1957)</h2>

        <p>Fierce resistance to desegregation was shown in <strong>September 1957</strong> at <dfn class="term" data-def="A high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, which became the centre of a desegregation crisis in 1957 when nine Black students attempted to enrol. Governor Orval Faubus used the Arkansas National Guard to block them, prompting President Eisenhower to send in federal troops to enforce their right to attend.">Central High School</dfn> in Little Rock, Arkansas.</p>

              <p>After weeks of crisis, President <strong>Eisenhower</strong> sent <strong>1,000 soldiers</strong> from the <strong>101st Airborne Division</strong> to escort the students into school. It was the first time since Reconstruction that a president had used federal troops to protect Black Americans&rsquo; rights.</p>
              <p>The nine students endured a year of <strong>harassment, physical attacks, and verbal abuse</strong>. Their courage showed both the bravery needed to challenge segregation and the depth of white resistance.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Significance of Little Rock</div>
          <p>Little Rock showed that: (1) Southern states would use force to resist desegregation; (2) the federal government <em>could</em> be pressured into acting; and (3) media coverage &mdash; especially television &mdash; was a powerful weapon for civil rights, as images of white hatred shocked moderate Americans and the world.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>James Meredith and the University of Mississippi (1962)</h2>

        <p>In <strong>1962</strong>, <strong>James Meredith</strong> became the first Black student to enrol at the <strong>University of Mississippi (&lsquo;Ole Miss&rsquo;)</strong>. The state governor tried to block him. President <strong>Kennedy</strong> sent <strong>federal marshals</strong> to enforce Meredith&rsquo;s right to attend. Violent <strong>riots</strong> broke out on campus &mdash; <strong>2 people were killed</strong> and hundreds injured. Meredith attended classes under armed guard. The crisis showed that even after Brown, every step towards integration could provoke deadly resistance.</p>

        <h2>The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955&ndash;1956)</h2>

        <p>While the NAACP fought segregation in the courts, a new form of protest emerged: <strong>direct action</strong>. The spark was the Montgomery Bus Boycott.</p>

        <h3>Claudette Colvin and Rosa Parks</h3>

        <p>Nine months before Rosa Parks, a <strong>15-year-old girl</strong> named <strong>Claudette Colvin</strong> refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus and was arrested. The NAACP chose not to build their case around Colvin because she was a pregnant teenager. This shows that the Parks case was a <strong>deliberate, strategic choice</strong> by civil rights leaders &mdash; not a random act.</p>

        <p>On <strong>1 December 1955</strong>, <dfn class="term" data-def="An African American civil rights activist who, on 1 December 1955, refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama.

        <h3>The Boycott</h3>

The <dfn class="term" data-def="A year-long protest (December 1955 to December 1956) during which the Black community of Montgomery, Alabama, refused to use the city's bus system to protest segregated seating.

It ended when the Supreme Court ruled bus segregation unconstitutional.">Montgomery Bus Boycott</dfn> lasted <strong>381 days</strong>.</p>

            <li>Protesters faced intimidation: <strong>MLK&rsquo;s home was bombed</strong>, and many boycotters were arrested or sacked</li>
            <li>On <strong>13 November 1956</strong>, the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Browder v. Gayle</em> that bus segregation was <strong>unconstitutional</strong></li>

          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Emergence of Martin Luther King Jr.</h3>

        <p>The boycott made a young Baptist minister famous: <strong>Dr Martin Luther King Jr.</strong>, aged just 26, was elected president of the <dfn class="term" data-def="The Montgomery Improvement Association, formed in December 1955 to organise and lead the Montgomery Bus Boycott. It elected the 26-year-old Martin Luther King Jr. as its president, launching his career as a civil rights leader.">Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA)</dfn> to lead the boycott.</p>

        <p>King was inspired by <strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong> and championed <dfn class="term" data-def="A strategy of protesting injustice through peaceful means such as boycotts, sit-ins, and marches, while refusing to use violence even when attacked. Martin Luther King Jr. was the most prominent advocate of this approach in the American civil rights movement.">non-violent direct action</dfn> &mdash; confronting injustice through peaceful protest.

        <h2>Eisenhower and Federal Action</h2>

        <p>President Eisenhower was a <strong>reluctant supporter</strong> of civil rights. He privately doubted the Brown ruling and was slow to act. But the Little Rock crisis forced his hand. In <strong>1957</strong>, he signed the <dfn class="term" data-def="Passed in 1957, this was the first federal civil rights legislation since 1875.

        <p>Examiners want to see you understand <strong>both the legal and direct-action approaches</strong>. The NAACP won court cases (Brown v. Board), while the Montgomery Bus Boycott showed the power of mass protest. A top answer explains how these strategies <strong>worked together</strong> &mdash; legal victories gave moral authority, while direct action created the public pressure to enforce change. Remember to mention Emmett Till as a catalyst and the role of media in building support.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1940s and 1950s laid the foundations of the civil rights movement. WW2 raised expectations and exposed American hypocrisy. Truman desegregated the military in 1948. The NAACP won the landmark Brown v. Board ruling. Emmett Till&rsquo;s murder in 1955 shocked the nation into action. The Montgomery Bus Boycott proved that mass non-violent protest worked and launched MLK as a leader. But progress was painfully slow &mdash; White Citizens&rsquo; Councils and violent resistance showed how deep opposition ran. The stage was set for the confrontations of the 1960s.</p>

          <li><strong>Jim Crow</strong> enforced legal segregation across the South, backed by violence from the KKK and economic pressure from White Citizens&rsquo; Councils.</li>
          <li><strong>Emmett Till&rsquo;s murder (1955)</strong> and his mother&rsquo;s open-casket funeral galvanised the civil rights movement.</li>
          <li><strong>Brown v. Board (1954)</strong> declared school segregation unconstitutional, but Southern resistance meant real change was painfully slow.</li>
          <li><strong>The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955&ndash;56)</strong> proved mass non-violent protest could win, and launched MLK as a national leader.</li>
          <li><strong>Little Rock (1957) and Ole Miss (1962)</strong> showed both the depth of white resistance and the power of federal intervention when media coverage forced action.</li>
        </ul>
