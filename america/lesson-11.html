        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Segregation and Jim Crow Laws</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">By the 1940s, African Americans &mdash; especially in the <strong>Southern states</strong> &mdash; faced racial discrimination enforced by law. The <dfn class="term" data-def="State and local laws enacted in the Southern United States from the 1870s onwards that enforced racial segregation in all public facilities, including schools, transport, restaurants, and drinking fountains.">Jim Crow laws</dfn> had been in place since the late 19th century. They created a system of <strong>legal segregation</strong> that touched every part of daily life.</p>

        <figure data-narration-id="n3" class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_jim_crow_segregation.png" alt="Infographic showing five areas of Jim Crow segregation in the American South: schools, transport, public facilities, restaurants and theatres, and voting — all separate and unequal despite Plessy v. Ferguson">
        </figure>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">In 1896, the Supreme Court ruling in <strong>Plessy v. Ferguson</strong> established the doctrine of <dfn class="term" data-def="The legal doctrine established by the 1896 Supreme Court case Plessy v.">&ldquo;separate but equal,&rdquo;</dfn> declaring segregation constitutional as long as facilities were equal. In reality, facilities for Black Americans were almost always <strong>vastly inferior</strong> &mdash; schools underfunded, hospitals poorly equipped, opportunities severely limited.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n5">Violence and Intimidation</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n6">Segregation was enforced not just by law but by <strong>violence and terror</strong>. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A white supremacist hate group founded in 1865 that used violence, lynching, and intimidation to terrorise Black Americans and prevent them from exercising their rights.">Ku Klux Klan (KKK)</dfn> terrorised Black communities through lynchings, bombings, and arson. Between 1882 and 1968, over <strong>4,700 people</strong> were lynched in the United States, the vast majority Black men. Police and courts often turned a blind eye, and killers were rarely punished.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n7">The Murder of Emmett Till (1955)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n8"><strong>Emmett Till</strong> was a <strong>14-year-old Black boy</strong> from Chicago visiting relatives in Mississippi in the summer of 1955. He allegedly whistled at a white woman, <strong>Carolyn Bryant</strong>, in a grocery store. Days later, her husband <strong>Roy Bryant</strong> and his half-brother <strong>J.W. Milam</strong> kidnapped Emmett from his great-uncle&rsquo;s home. They beat him brutally, shot him, and dumped his body in the Tallahatchie River.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n9" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Emmett Till</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n10">Emmett&rsquo;s mother, <strong>Mamie Till</strong>, insisted on an <strong>open-casket funeral</strong> so the world could see what had been done to her son. Photos of his mutilated body were published in <em>Jet</em> magazine and shocked the nation. Despite overwhelming evidence, the <strong>all-white jury acquitted Bryant and Milam in just 67 minutes</strong>. The case became a catalyst for the civil rights movement &mdash; thousands of Americans, Black and white, were outraged and galvanised into action.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n11">The Impact of World War Two</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">World War Two (1939&ndash;1945) was a turning point for civil rights. The war exposed the hypocrisy of fighting for freedom abroad while tolerating racial oppression at home.</p>

The <strong>Tuskegee Airmen</strong> &mdash; an all-Black fighter pilot squadron &mdash; excelled in combat and challenged racist assumptions.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n14"><strong>The Double V Campaign:</strong> The <em>Pittsburgh Courier</em> launched the <dfn class="term" data-def="A campaign launched by the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper in 1942, calling for African Americans to fight for a double victory: victory against fascism abroad in World War Two, and victory against racism at home in the United States.">&ldquo;Double V&rdquo; campaign</dfn> in 1942 &mdash; victory against fascism abroad and victory against racism at home.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n15"><strong>Economic opportunities:</strong> The wartime boom drew hundreds of thousands of Black Americans to Northern and Western factories during the <dfn class="term" data-def="The large-scale migration of over 6 million African Americans from the rural Southern states to cities in the North, Midwest, and West between 1910 and 1970, driven by the search for better economic opportunities and escape from Jim Crow segregation.">Great Migration</dfn>. Even in the North, however, Black workers were usually given the <strong>lowest-paid jobs</strong> and were <strong>the first to be laid off</strong> during downturns. In 1941, <strong>A. Philip Randolph</strong> threatened a march on Washington to demand fair employment. Roosevelt responded with <strong>Executive Order 8802</strong>, banning racial discrimination in the defence industry &mdash; the first federal civil rights action since Reconstruction.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n16"><strong>Truman desegregates the military:</strong> In <strong>1948</strong>, President Truman signed <strong>Executive Order 9981</strong>, desegregating the US armed forces. This was a major early federal civil rights action, showing the growing political pressure for change.</p>
              <p data-narration-id="n17"><strong>Returning veterans:</strong> Black veterans came home expecting the freedoms they had fought for. Instead, they faced the same Jim Crow discrimination. This injustice radicalised many and swelled the ranks of civil rights groups.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n18">The NAACP and Legal Challenges</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n19">The <dfn class="term" data-def="The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, founded in 1909.">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)</dfn>, founded in 1909, was the leading civil rights organisation. For decades, the NAACP campaigned for the federal government to pass anti-lynching laws and protect Black voting rights. But the government <strong>refused to act</strong> &mdash; it did not want a fight with powerful Southern politicians over <dfn class="term" data-def="The argument that individual states, not the federal government, should have the final say over laws within their borders.">&ldquo;states&rsquo; rights.&rdquo;</dfn> The NAACP&rsquo;s strategy therefore shifted towards using the <strong>legal system</strong> to challenge segregation, bringing carefully chosen test cases to court.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">The NAACP&rsquo;s chief lawyer, <strong>Thurgood Marshall</strong>, led a series of legal victories in the 1940s and 1950s that chipped away at &ldquo;separate but equal.&rdquo; Marshall later became the first African American Supreme Court Justice in 1967.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n21">Brown v. Board of Education (1954)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n22">The biggest legal victory came on <strong>17 May 1954</strong>, when the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in <dfn class="term" data-def="A landmark 1954 Supreme Court case in which the court ruled unanimously that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, overturning the 'separate but equal' doctrine established by Plessy v.">Brown v.

        <div data-narration-id="n23" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Brown v. Board of Education</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n24">The case was brought by <strong>Oliver Brown</strong> on behalf of his daughter <strong>Linda</strong>, denied entry to her local all-white school in Topeka, Kansas. She had to travel a long way to reach a segregated Black school. Chief Justice <strong>Earl Warren</strong> declared that <em>&ldquo;separate educational facilities are inherently unequal&rdquo;</em> &mdash; violating the 14th Amendment. This overturned <strong>Plessy v. Ferguson</strong> after 58 years.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n25">Significance and Limitations</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n26">Brown was a <strong>landmark moment</strong>. It established that segregation was unconstitutional and gave the movement huge moral and legal force. But the ruling had serious limits:</p>
        <ul data-narration-id="n56">
          <li>The Supreme Court set <strong>no deadline</strong>, saying only that desegregation should happen &ldquo;with all deliberate speed&rdquo;</li>
          <li>Many Southern states <strong>refused to comply</strong> &mdash; over 100 Southern congressmen signed the &ldquo;Southern Manifesto&rdquo; pledging resistance</li>
          <li><strong>White Citizens&rsquo; Councils</strong> formed across the South to fight integration. They had around <strong>250,000 members</strong> and used economic pressure &mdash; such as sacking workers and refusing loans &mdash; to punish anyone who supported desegregation</li>
          <li>By 1957, <strong>not a single Black child</strong> attended an integrated school in Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, or South Carolina</li>
          <li>The ruling only applied to <strong>schools</strong>, not other areas of segregation</li>
        </ul>

              <p data-narration-id="n32">The nine students endured a year of <strong>harassment, physical attacks, and verbal abuse</strong>. Their courage showed both the bravery needed to challenge segregation and the depth of white resistance.</p>

          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Significance of Little Rock</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n34">Little Rock showed that: (1) Southern states would use force to resist desegregation; (2) the federal government <em>could</em> be pressured into acting; and (3) media coverage &mdash; especially television &mdash; was a powerful weapon for civil rights, as images of white hatred shocked moderate Americans and the world.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n35">James Meredith and the University of Mississippi (1962)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n36">In <strong>1962</strong>, <strong>James Meredith</strong> became the first Black student to enrol at the <strong>University of Mississippi (&lsquo;Ole Miss&rsquo;)</strong>. The state governor tried to block him. President <strong>Kennedy</strong> sent <strong>federal marshals</strong> to enforce Meredith&rsquo;s right to attend. Violent <strong>riots</strong> broke out on campus &mdash; <strong>2 people were killed</strong> and hundreds injured. Meredith attended classes under armed guard. The crisis showed that even after Brown, every step towards integration could provoke deadly resistance.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n37">The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955&ndash;1956)</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n38">While the NAACP fought segregation in the courts, a new form of protest emerged: <strong>direct action</strong>. The spark was the Montgomery Bus Boycott.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n39">Claudette Colvin and Rosa Parks</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n40">Nine months before Rosa Parks, a <strong>15-year-old girl</strong> named <strong>Claudette Colvin</strong> refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus and was arrested. The NAACP chose not to build their case around Colvin because she was a pregnant teenager. This shows that the Parks case was a <strong>deliberate, strategic choice</strong> by civil rights leaders &mdash; not a random act.</p>

Parks was an experienced activist who had trained at the <strong>Highlander Folk School</strong>, a centre for civil rights education.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n42">The Boycott</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n43">Montgomery&rsquo;s Black community launched a <strong>total boycott</strong> of the city&rsquo;s bus system. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A year-long protest (December 1955 to December 1956) during which the Black community of Montgomery, Alabama, refused to use the city's bus system to protest segregated seating.">Montgomery Bus Boycott</dfn> lasted <strong>381 days</strong>.</p>

            <li>Around <strong>40,000</strong> Black commuters walked, carpooled, or cycled instead of riding segregated buses</li>
            <li>Black passengers made up <strong>75%</strong> of bus riders, so the boycott devastated the bus company financially</li>
            <li>Protesters faced intimidation: <strong>MLK&rsquo;s home was bombed</strong>, and many boycotters were arrested or sacked</li>
            <li>On <strong>13 November 1956</strong>, the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Browder v. Gayle</em> that bus segregation was <strong>unconstitutional</strong></li>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n48">Eisenhower and Federal Action</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n49">President Eisenhower was a <strong>reluctant supporter</strong> of civil rights. He privately doubted the Brown ruling and was slow to act. But the Little Rock crisis forced his hand. In <strong>1957</strong>, he signed the <dfn class="term" data-def="Passed in 1957, this was the first federal civil rights legislation since 1875.">Civil Rights Act of 1957</dfn> &mdash; the first federal civil rights law since 1875. It set up a Civil Rights Commission and gave the government some power to protect voting rights, though it was <strong>weakened by compromise</strong> in Congress and had limited real impact.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n51">Examiners want to see you understand <strong>both the legal and direct-action approaches</strong>. The NAACP won court cases (Brown v. Board), while the Montgomery Bus Boycott showed the power of mass protest. A top answer explains how these strategies <strong>worked together</strong> &mdash; legal victories gave moral authority, while direct action created the public pressure to enforce change. Remember to mention Emmett Till as a catalyst and the role of media in building support.</p>

        <h2 data-narration-id="n53">Conclusion</h2>
        <p data-narration-id="n54">The 1940s and 1950s laid the foundations of the civil rights movement. WW2 raised expectations and exposed American hypocrisy. Truman desegregated the military in 1948. The NAACP won the landmark Brown v. Board ruling. Emmett Till&rsquo;s murder in 1955 shocked the nation into action. The Montgomery Bus Boycott proved that mass non-violent protest worked and launched MLK as a leader. But progress was painfully slow &mdash; White Citizens&rsquo; Councils and violent resistance showed how deep opposition ran. The stage was set for the confrontations of the 1960s.</p>
        <h3 data-narration-id="n55">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n58">
          <li><strong>Jim Crow</strong> enforced legal segregation across the South, backed by violence from the KKK and economic pressure from White Citizens&rsquo; Councils.</li>
          <li><strong>Emmett Till&rsquo;s murder (1955)</strong> and his mother&rsquo;s open-casket funeral galvanised the civil rights movement.</li>
          <li><strong>Brown v. Board (1954)</strong> declared school segregation unconstitutional, but Southern resistance meant real change was painfully slow.</li>
          <li><strong>The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955&ndash;56)</strong> proved mass non-violent protest could win, and launched MLK as a national leader.</li>
          <li><strong>Little Rock (1957) and Ole Miss (1962)</strong> showed both the depth of white resistance and the power of federal intervention when media coverage forced action.</li>

Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the ways in which the laws were damaging.\nExample: Jim Crow laws enforced racial segregation in public facilities such as schools, transport, restaurants, and drinking fountains. Black schools were severely underfunded compared to white schools, meaning Black children received a worse education and had fewer opportunities later in life.\n\nAnother example: Jim Crow laws prevented most African Americans in the South from voting through poll taxes, literacy tests, and intimidation. This meant Black communities had no political voice and could not elect representatives who would fight for their interests.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge.

Students progress from a simple demonstration of knowledge with extended reasoning supported by understanding of, for example, the obstacles to desegregation.\nExample: The Supreme Court set no deadline for desegregation, saying only that it should happen \u2018with all deliberate speed.\u2019 This vague wording gave Southern states an excuse to delay for years, and by 1957 not a single Black child attended an integrated school in Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, or South Carolina.\n\nAnother example: Over 100 Southern congressmen signed the \u2018Southern Manifesto\u2019 pledging resistance to desegregation. White Citizens\u2019 Councils formed across the South with around 250,000 members, using economic pressure such as sacking workers and refusing loans to punish anyone who supported integration.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Answers demonstrate knowledge.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: The civil rights campaigns affected different groups in different ways. The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955\u201356) showed that mass non-violent protest could win \u2014 40,000 Black commuters walked or carpooled for 381 days, crippling the bus company financially and ultimately leading the Supreme Court to rule bus segregation unconstitutional in Browder v. Gayle. This victory changed daily life for Black citizens in Montgomery but also inspired campaigns across the South. However, the backlash was severe: MLK\u2019s home was bombed, White Citizens\u2019 Councils formed with 250,000 members, and Little Rock showed that federal troops might be needed to enforce even basic rights. White Southerners felt their way of life was under attack, while moderate white Americans were shocked by television images of white hatred and became more sympathetic to the movement.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: The Brown v. Board ruling (1954) declared school segregation unconstitutional, giving the movement legal force. The Little Rock Nine (1957) showed both the courage needed and the violent resistance faced, as Eisenhower sent 1,000 troops from the 101st Airborne to escort students. Media coverage of Elizabeth Eckford being harassed by a white mob caused international outrage and put pressure on the federal government to act.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: Rosa Parks\u2019 arrest in 1955 led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted 381 days and ended with buses being desegregated.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Civil rights campaigns helped end segregation.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain complexities of change arising from differences such as time, group, social and/or economic impact.\nExample: Emmett Till\u2019s murder in 1955 and the Montgomery Bus Boycott had different but connected effects. Till\u2019s death \u2014 and his mother Mamie\u2019s decision to hold an open-casket funeral, with photos published in Jet magazine \u2014 shocked Americans of all races. The all-white jury\u2019s acquittal of Bryant and Milam in just 67 minutes exposed the injustice of the Southern legal system and galvanised thousands into action. The emotional impact was crucial: it made white Americans outside the South aware of the brutality of Jim Crow. The Montgomery Bus Boycott, sparked by Rosa Parks\u2019 arrest just months later, showed that this anger could be channelled into organised, sustained protest. The boycott\u2019s success \u2014 lasting 381 days with 40,000 Black commuters finding alternative transport \u2014 proved that economic pressure worked and launched MLK as a national leader. Together, these events transformed the movement from a legal campaign to a mass movement.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of changes.

Students consider two or more consequences with developed reasoning.\nExample: Emmett Till\u2019s murder became a catalyst for the movement because his mother insisted on an open-casket funeral, and the horrific photos were published nationwide. The Montgomery Bus Boycott showed African Americans that they had economic power: since Black passengers made up 75% of bus riders, the boycott devastated the bus company financially and eventually forced desegregation.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of change. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning about one identified change.\nExample: The Montgomery Bus Boycott lasted 381 days and ended when the Supreme Court ruled bus segregation unconstitutional, meaning Black people no longer had to give up their seats.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of change(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Emmett Till\u2019s murder made people angry about racism.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: Both events were crucial, but they worked in different ways. Brown v. Board (1954) was a legal landmark \u2014 Chief Justice Earl Warren\u2019s unanimous ruling that \u2018separate educational facilities are inherently unequal\u2019 overturned Plessy v. Ferguson after 58 years and gave the movement legal authority. However, it did not produce immediate change: the Court set no deadline, the Southern Manifesto pledged resistance, and White Citizens\u2019 Councils fought integration. The Montgomery Bus Boycott showed a different kind of power \u2014 mass non-violent protest. The 381-day boycott proved that ordinary Black citizens could cripple an unjust system through economic pressure and discipline. It launched MLK as a leader and inspired the SCLC. On balance, both were essential: Brown gave legal legitimacy, while Montgomery demonstrated that grassroots action could enforce change. Without Brown\u2019s constitutional framework, direct action campaigns would have lacked legal backing; without Montgomery\u2019s mass movement, Brown would have remained unenforced.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): Brown v. Board overturned \u2018separate but equal\u2019 and declared school segregation unconstitutional. This was brought by Thurgood Marshall on behalf of Linda Brown and gave the movement huge moral force.\nExample (bullet 2): The Montgomery Bus Boycott lasted 381 days, with 40,000 Black commuters finding alternative transport. It ended with the Supreme Court ruling bus segregation unconstitutional in Browder v. Gayle and made MLK a national figure.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Brown v. Board said segregation in schools was illegal, which was important because it showed the Supreme Court was on the side of civil rights.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The Montgomery Bus Boycott helped end segregation on buses.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        text: "Which of the following had more impact on advancing civil rights for African Americans:\n\n\u2022 the NAACP\u2019s legal strategy\n\u2022 direct action and mass protest?\n\nExplain your answer with reference to both bullet points.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (10\u201312 marks): Complex explanation of both bullets leading to a sustained judgement. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding. Students explain the relationship between causes arriving at a sustained judgement.\nExample: The NAACP\u2019s legal strategy and direct action were both essential and worked together. Thurgood Marshall\u2019s legal victories culminated in Brown v. Board (1954), which overturned \u2018separate but equal\u2019 and established the constitutional principle that segregation was illegal. Without this legal framework, direct action could have been dismissed as lawbreaking. However, legal rulings alone were not enough \u2014 Southern states simply refused to comply. Direct action created the public pressure to enforce change. The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955\u201356) showed that mass economic pressure worked: 40,000 Black commuters boycotted for 381 days, financially crippling the bus company. The Little Rock crisis (1957) forced Eisenhower to send federal troops, but only because media coverage of Elizabeth Eckford being harassed by a mob created international outrage. Rosa Parks\u2019 arrest was itself a deliberate NAACP strategy, showing how legal planning and direct action were intertwined. The most effective approach combined both: legal victories gave moral authority, while direct action created the political pressure to make those victories real.\n\nLevel 3 (7\u20139 marks): Developed explanation of both bullets. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Extended reasoning supported by developed factual knowledge.\nExample (bullet 1): The NAACP, led by Thurgood Marshall, brought the Brown v. Board case to the Supreme Court, winning a unanimous ruling that school segregation was unconstitutional. This overturned Plessy v. Ferguson and gave the movement legal backing.\nExample (bullet 2): The Montgomery Bus Boycott and Little Rock Nine showed that mass protest and direct action could force the federal government to intervene. Eisenhower sent 1,000 soldiers from the 101st Airborne to protect the Little Rock Nine, the first use of federal troops for civil rights since Reconstruction.\n\nLevel 2 (4\u20136 marks): Simple explanation of bullet(s). Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The Montgomery Bus Boycott was important because it proved that Black Americans could use economic power to fight segregation.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20133 marks): Basic explanation of bullet(s). Basic knowledge, explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The NAACP used the courts to challenge segregation laws.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."
