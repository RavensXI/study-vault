        <h2>The Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement</h2>

        <p>The civil rights movement inspired other groups to campaign for their rights. The <dfn class="term" data-def="A broad social and political movement that emerged in the 1960s, campaigning for gender equality in areas including employment, pay, education, reproductive rights, and legal status. It built on the earlier suffrage movement and was sometimes called 'second-wave feminism.'">women&rsquo;s liberation movement</dfn> &mdash; sometimes called &ldquo;second-wave feminism&rdquo; &mdash; became one of the most significant social movements of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

        <h3>The Problem with No Name</h3>

        <p>In <strong>1963</strong>, journalist <dfn class="term" data-def="An American feminist writer and activist whose 1963 book The Feminine Mystique challenged the idea that women could find fulfilment solely through housework and motherhood. The book helped spark the women's liberation movement and Friedan went on to co-found the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966.">Betty Friedan</dfn> published <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>, a groundbreaking book that challenged the idea that women could only find fulfilment through being housewives and mothers. Friedan described the deep dissatisfaction felt by millions of educated, middle-class women trapped in domestic roles as &ldquo;the problem that has no name.&rdquo;</p>

            <li>Many jobs were openly advertised as <strong>&ldquo;men only&rdquo;</strong> or &ldquo;women only,&rdquo; with higher-paid positions reserved for men</li>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Equal Pay Act (1963):</strong> This federal law required employers to pay men and women equally for the same work. While it was a landmark step, enforcement was weak and a significant <strong>gender pay gap</strong> persisted.</p>
              <p><strong>Civil Rights Act (1964):</strong> Title VII of the Act banned discrimination based on <strong>sex</strong> as well as race in employment. Ironically, the word &ldquo;sex&rdquo; was added by a Southern congressman who hoped it would make the bill so controversial it would fail &mdash; but the bill passed regardless.</p>
              <p><strong>National Organization for Women (NOW):</strong> Founded in <strong>1966</strong> by Betty Friedan and others, NOW became the leading women&rsquo;s rights organisation. It campaigned for equal pay, equal opportunities in education and employment, and reproductive rights. By 1971, NOW had <strong>15,000 members</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>Title IX (1972):</strong> This legislation banned sex discrimination in any educational programme receiving federal funding, dramatically increasing opportunities for women in higher education and school sports.</p>
              <p><strong>Roe v. Wade (1973):</strong> In this landmark Supreme Court case, the court ruled that women had a constitutional right to an <strong>abortion</strong> in the early stages of pregnancy, based on the right to privacy. This was one of the most controversial rulings in American history and remains deeply divisive.</p>

        <h3>Limitations</h3>

        <p>Despite these gains, the women&rsquo;s movement had significant limitations. The proposed <dfn class="term" data-def="A proposed amendment to the US Constitution that would have guaranteed equal legal rights regardless of sex. First proposed in 1923, it passed Congress in 1972 but failed to gain ratification by the required 38 states before its deadline in 1982.">Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)</dfn>, which would have guaranteed equal rights under the Constitution regardless of sex, passed Congress in 1972 but <strong>failed to be ratified</strong> by enough states. Conservative opponents, led by <strong>Phyllis Schlafly</strong>, argued that it would undermine family values and force women into military service. The pay gap persisted, and women remained underrepresented in positions of power.</p>

        <h2>Native American Rights</h2>

        <p>Native Americans were the <strong>poorest and most disadvantaged</strong> minority group in the United States. By the 1960s, they faced appalling conditions: life expectancy was <strong>20 years below</strong> the national average, unemployment on reservations exceeded <strong>50%</strong>, and the suicide rate was <strong>twice</strong> the national average.</p>

        <h3>Background: Termination Policy</h3>

        <p>Since the late 1940s, the US government had pursued a policy of <dfn class="term" data-def="A US government policy from the late 1940s to the 1960s that aimed to end the special legal relationship between Native American tribes and the federal government, dissolving reservations and encouraging Native Americans to assimilate into mainstream American society.

        <p>When writing about other rights movements, examiners look for <strong>connections to the Black civil rights movement</strong>. Show how groups like women, Native Americans, and Hispanic Americans were <strong>inspired by and modelled their tactics on</strong> the civil rights movement &mdash; using non-violent protest, boycotts, and legal challenges. Also consider the <strong>differences</strong>: each group faced distinct forms of discrimination and had specific goals.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The civil rights movement inspired a wave of activism among other disadvantaged groups in American society. The women&rsquo;s liberation movement achieved significant legislative gains including the Equal Pay Act and Title IX, and the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, though the ERA failed and deep inequalities persisted. Native Americans, through organisations like AIM and dramatic actions at Alcatraz and Wounded Knee, forced the government to end the destructive termination policy and grant greater self-determination. Hispanic Americans, led by Cesar Chavez and the UFW, won important labour rights through non-violent boycotts and strikes. Each movement demonstrated that the struggle for equality in America extended far beyond the issue of Black civil rights.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Betty Friedan&rsquo;s <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> (1963)</strong> and the founding of <strong>NOW (1966)</strong> launched the women&rsquo;s liberation movement, achieving major legislation but falling short of the ERA.</li>
          <li><strong>Roe v. Wade (1973)</strong> established a constitutional right to abortion, becoming one of the most significant and controversial Supreme Court rulings in American history.</li>
          <li><strong>AIM and Wounded Knee (1973)</strong> brought national attention to the desperate conditions faced by Native Americans and helped end the termination policy.</li>
          <li><strong>Cesar Chavez and the UFW</strong> used non-violent boycotts to win better conditions for migrant farm workers, with the Delano Grape Boycott becoming a model of effective protest.</li>
          <li>All these movements were <strong>inspired by the Black civil rights movement</strong> and used similar tactics of non-violent direct action, legal challenges, and media attention.</li>
