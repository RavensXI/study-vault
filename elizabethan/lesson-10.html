        <h2>The Problem of the Poor</h2>

        <p>During Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign (1558&ndash;1603), poverty grew sharply across England. The government had to find new ways to deal with it. This led to the Elizabethan Poor Laws &mdash; some of the first attempts to make poverty a matter of <strong>government responsibility</strong> rather than private charity.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Categories of Poor</div>
          <p>Elizabethans divided the poor into three groups:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The &lsquo;Helpless Poor&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; the old, sick, disabled, and very young who could not work</li>
            <li><strong>The &lsquo;Deserving Poor&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; those who wanted to work but could not find jobs</li>
            <li><strong>The &lsquo;Idle Poor&rsquo; (vagabonds)</strong> &mdash; able-bodied people seen as choosing not to work; feared and punished</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Why Was Poverty Increasing?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Growing population:</strong> England&rsquo;s population rose from about 3 million in 1550 to over 4 million by 1600. More people meant more competition for jobs, food, and housing.</li>
          <li><strong>Bad harvests:</strong> A series of poor harvests &mdash; especially 1594&ndash;1597 &mdash; caused food shortages and rising prices.</li>
          <li><strong>Enclosure:</strong> Wealthy landowners enclosed common land to farm sheep for the wool trade. This forced many small farmers off the land.</li>
          <li><strong>Dissolution of the monasteries:</strong> Henry VIII closed the monasteries in the 1530s. They had provided food, shelter, and medical care for the poor. Nothing replaced them.</li>
          <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Prices rose much faster than wages. Between 1500 and 1600, food prices rose by about 400%, while wages only doubled.</li>
          <li><strong>Demobilised soldiers:</strong> Men returning from wars in the Netherlands and Ireland often had no jobs waiting for them.</li>
          <li><strong>Decline of the cloth trade:</strong> The Antwerp cloth market collapsed in the 1550s, causing unemployment in cloth-making towns.</li>
          <li><strong>Plague outbreaks:</strong> Epidemics hit in 1563, 1578, and 1582. People feared that beggars moving from town to town were spreading disease.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Attitudes Towards the Poor</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sympathy for the helpless:</strong> Most people agreed the old, sick, and disabled deserved help. Churches and wealthy individuals gave charity.</li>
          <li><strong>Fear of vagabonds:</strong> &lsquo;Sturdy beggars&rsquo; were widely feared. People believed they spread plague, committed crimes, and might cause rebellion. Some vagabonds were ex-soldiers or hardened criminals &mdash; pickpockets even had their own slang language called <dfn class="term" data-def="A secret slang used by criminals and vagabonds in Elizabethan England.">&lsquo;canting&rsquo;</dfn>.</li>
          <li><strong>Media panic:</strong> Pamphlets by authors like <strong>Thomas Harman</strong> warned about the danger of vagabonds. These were cheap and widely read. They created panic, much like sensational news stories today.</li>
          <li><strong>Changing views:</strong> Over time, people began to accept that most vagabonds were ordinary unemployed people looking for work. Towns like <strong>Norwich</strong>, <strong>York</strong>, and <strong>Ipswich</strong> experimented with local schemes &mdash; licensing beggars, training children in trades, and conducting surveys to separate the idle from the genuinely poor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Punishments for the Idle Poor</h3>

        <p>Those classed as &lsquo;idle&rsquo; faced harsh punishments designed to deter begging:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Whipping</strong> &mdash; the most common punishment for vagabonds</li>
          <li><strong>Branding</strong> &mdash; a hot iron mark on the skin as a permanent warning</li>
          <li><strong>Boring</strong> &mdash; a hole burned through the ear</li>
          <li><strong>Hanging</strong> &mdash; repeat offenders could face the death penalty</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Government Action: The Poor Laws</h3>

        <p>Attitudes to poverty changed over time. Under Henry VIII, the poor were mostly just punished. Gradually, the government realised that a national system was needed &mdash; partly inspired by successful local schemes in towns like Norwich.</p>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>1563 &mdash; Statute of Artificers:</strong> JPs could raise money for poor relief. Refusing to pay could lead to prison.</p>
              <p><strong>1572 &mdash; Vagabonds Act:</strong> A national poor rate (tax) was introduced. Vagabonds caught begging could be whipped and have a hole burned through their ear. Repeat offenders could be imprisoned or executed.</p>
              <p><strong>1576 &mdash; Poor Relief Act:</strong> Towns had to provide raw materials (like wool) so the able-bodied poor could work. &lsquo;Houses of Correction&rsquo; were set up for those who refused.</p>
              <p><strong>1601 &mdash; The Elizabethan Poor Law:</strong> The most important law. It brought together previous laws into one system. Each parish had to appoint an <strong>Overseer of the Poor</strong>, collect a compulsory poor rate (taxing the wealthy), provide relief for those who could not work, set up work for the able-bodied, and punish those who refused to work.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The 1601 Poor Law</div>
          <p>The 1601 Poor Law established that the <strong>wealthy should be taxed</strong> to pay for the care of the poor. It set the principle of <strong>government responsibility</strong> for welfare, and it remained the basis of poor relief for over <strong>200 years</strong> &mdash; until the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How Effective Were the Poor Laws?</h3>

        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Created a <strong>national system</strong> of poor relief for the first time</li>
          <li>Made poverty a <strong>government responsibility</strong>, not just private charity</li>
          <li>Distinguished between different types of poor and treated them accordingly</li>
          <li>The system lasted over 200 years, suggesting it worked reasonably well</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Relief was often <strong>very small</strong> &mdash; barely enough to survive on</li>
          <li>Conditions in Houses of Correction were <strong>deliberately harsh</strong></li>
          <li>The laws <strong>did not fix root causes</strong> like enclosure, inflation, or unemployment</li>
          <li>Enforcement varied hugely from parish to parish</li>
          <li>Punishments for vagabonds were cruel and did little to solve the problem</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This topic often comes up as a <strong>&ldquo;Write an account&rdquo;</strong> question about <strong>change over time</strong>. Show how attitudes shifted: from simply punishing beggars under Henry VIII, to local experiments in towns like Norwich, to the 1601 Poor Law making the wealthy pay taxes to support the poor. Link causes of poverty to government responses, and evaluate both strengths and weaknesses.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Poverty grew sharply under Elizabeth, driven by population growth, inflation, enclosure, bad harvests, and the loss of monastic charity. The government&rsquo;s response changed over time &mdash; from harsh punishment towards a national system of relief. The 1601 Poor Law was a landmark, establishing that the wealthy should be taxed to support the poor. It was not perfect, but it lasted over 200 years.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Poverty had many causes:</strong> Population growth, enclosure, inflation, bad harvests, plague, and the loss of monastic charity all played a part.</li>
          <li><strong>Attitudes changed over time:</strong> The government moved from punishing beggars to providing a national system of relief &mdash; partly inspired by successful local schemes in Norwich, York, and Ipswich.</li>
          <li><strong>The 1601 Poor Law was a landmark:</strong> It made the wealthy pay a compulsory poor rate and established government responsibility for welfare.</li>
