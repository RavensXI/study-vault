        <h2>The Problem of the Poor</h2>

        <p>During Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign (1558&ndash;1603), poverty grew sharply across England. The government had to find new ways to deal with it. This led to the Elizabethan Poor Laws &mdash; some of the first attempts to make poverty a matter of <strong>government responsibility</strong> rather than private charity.</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_categories_poor.png" alt="Infographic showing the three categories of poor in Elizabethan England: the Helpless Poor (given charity), the Deserving Poor (given work materials), and the Idle Poor/Vagabonds (punished)">
        </figure>

        <h3>Why Was Poverty Increasing?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Growing population:</strong> England&rsquo;s population rose from about 3 million in 1550 to over 4 million by 1600. More people meant more competition for jobs, food, and housing.</li>
          <li><strong>Bad harvests:</strong> A series of poor harvests &mdash; especially 1594&ndash;1597 &mdash; caused food shortages and rising prices.</li>
          <li><strong>Enclosure:</strong> Wealthy landowners enclosed common land to farm sheep for the wool trade. This forced many small farmers off the land.</li>
          <li><strong>Dissolution of the monasteries:</strong> Henry VIII closed the monasteries in the 1530s. They had provided food, shelter, and medical care for the poor. Nothing replaced them.</li>
          <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Prices rose much faster than wages. Between 1500 and 1600, food prices rose by about 400%, while wages only doubled.</li>
          <li><strong>Demobilised soldiers:</strong> Men returning from wars in the Netherlands and Ireland often had no jobs waiting for them.</li>
          <li><strong>Decline of the cloth trade:</strong> The Antwerp cloth market collapsed in the 1550s, causing unemployment in cloth-making towns.</li>
          <li><strong>Plague outbreaks:</strong> Epidemics hit in 1563, 1578, and 1582. People feared that beggars moving from town to town were spreading disease.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Attitudes Towards the Poor</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sympathy for the helpless:</strong> Most people agreed the old, sick, and disabled deserved help. Churches and wealthy individuals gave charity.</li>
          <li><strong>Fear of vagabonds:</strong> &lsquo;Sturdy beggars&rsquo; were widely feared. People believed they spread plague, committed crimes, and might cause rebellion. Some vagabonds were ex-soldiers or hardened criminals &mdash; pickpockets even had their own slang language called <dfn class="term" data-def="A secret slang used by criminals and vagabonds in Elizabethan England.">&lsquo;canting&rsquo;</dfn>.</li>
          <li><strong>Media panic:</strong> Pamphlets by authors like <strong>Thomas Harman</strong> warned about the danger of vagabonds. These were cheap and widely read. They created panic, much like sensational news stories today.</li>
          <li><strong>Changing views:</strong> Over time, people began to accept that most vagabonds were ordinary unemployed people looking for work. Towns like <strong>Norwich</strong>, <strong>York</strong>, and <strong>Ipswich</strong> experimented with local schemes &mdash; licensing beggars, training children in trades, and conducting surveys to separate the idle from the genuinely poor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Punishments for the Idle Poor</h3>

        <p>Those classed as &lsquo;idle&rsquo; faced harsh punishments designed to deter begging:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Whipping</strong> &mdash; the most common punishment for vagabonds</li>
          <li><strong>Branding</strong> &mdash; a hot iron mark on the skin as a permanent warning</li>
          <li><strong>Boring</strong> &mdash; a hole burned through the ear</li>
          <li><strong>Hanging</strong> &mdash; repeat offenders could face the death penalty</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Government Action: The Poor Laws</h3>

        <p>Attitudes to poverty changed over time. Under Henry VIII, the poor were mostly just punished. Gradually, the government realised that a national system was needed &mdash; partly inspired by successful local schemes in towns like Norwich.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>1563 &mdash; Statute of Artificers:</strong> JPs could raise money for poor relief. Refusing to pay could lead to prison.</p>
              <p><strong>1572 &mdash; Vagabonds Act:</strong> A national poor rate (tax) was introduced. Vagabonds caught begging could be whipped and have a hole burned through their ear. Repeat offenders could be imprisoned or executed.</p>
              <p><strong>1576 &mdash; Poor Relief Act:</strong> Towns had to provide raw materials (like wool) so the able-bodied poor could work. &lsquo;Houses of Correction&rsquo; were set up for those who refused.</p>
              <p><strong>1601 &mdash; The Elizabethan Poor Law:</strong> The most important law. It brought together previous laws into one system. Each parish had to appoint an <strong>Overseer of the Poor</strong>, collect a compulsory poor rate (taxing the wealthy), provide relief for those who could not work, set up work for the able-bodied, and punish those who refused to work.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The 1601 Poor Law</div>
          <p>The 1601 Poor Law established that the <strong>wealthy should be taxed</strong> to pay for the care of the poor. It set the principle of <strong>government responsibility</strong> for welfare, and it remained the basis of poor relief for over <strong>200 years</strong> &mdash; until the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How Effective Were the Poor Laws?</h3>

        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Created a <strong>national system</strong> of poor relief for the first time</li>
          <li>Made poverty a <strong>government responsibility</strong>, not just private charity</li>
          <li>Distinguished between different types of poor and treated them accordingly</li>
          <li>The system lasted over 200 years, suggesting it worked reasonably well</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Relief was often <strong>very small</strong> &mdash; barely enough to survive on</li>
          <li>Conditions in Houses of Correction were <strong>deliberately harsh</strong></li>
          <li>The laws <strong>did not fix root causes</strong> like enclosure, inflation, or unemployment</li>
          <li>Enforcement varied hugely from parish to parish</li>
          <li>Punishments for vagabonds were cruel and did little to solve the problem</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This topic often comes up as a <strong>&ldquo;Write an account&rdquo;</strong> question about <strong>change over time</strong>. Show how attitudes shifted: from simply punishing beggars under Henry VIII, to local experiments in towns like Norwich, to the 1601 Poor Law making the wealthy pay taxes to support the poor. Link causes of poverty to government responses, and evaluate both strengths and weaknesses.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Poverty grew sharply under Elizabeth, driven by population growth, inflation, enclosure, bad harvests, and the loss of monastic charity. The government&rsquo;s response changed over time &mdash; from harsh punishment towards a national system of relief. The 1601 Poor Law was a landmark, establishing that the wealthy should be taxed to support the poor. It was not perfect, but it lasted over 200 years.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Poverty had many causes:</strong> Population growth, enclosure, inflation, bad harvests, plague, and the loss of monastic charity all played a part.</li>
          <li><strong>Attitudes changed over time:</strong> The government moved from punishing beggars to providing a national system of relief &mdash; partly inspired by successful local schemes in Norwich, York, and Ipswich.</li>
          <li><strong>The 1601 Poor Law was a landmark:</strong> It made the wealthy pay a compulsory poor rate and established government responsibility for welfare.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: A complex account might trace multiple interconnected causes. England\u2019s population rose from about 3 million (1550) to over 4 million by 1600, increasing competition for jobs, food, and housing. Enclosure forced small farmers off the land as wealthy landowners turned common land to sheep farming for wool. Henry VIII\u2019s dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s removed a key source of charity for the poor \u2014 nothing replaced it. Inflation was severe: food prices rose about 400% between 1500 and 1600 while wages only doubled. Bad harvests in 1594\u20131597 caused food shortages. The decline of the Antwerp cloth market in the 1550s caused unemployment. Demobilised soldiers returning from wars in the Netherlands and Ireland had no jobs. Plague outbreaks (1563, 1578, 1582) spread fear that beggars were carrying disease. The account might show how these causes reinforced each other.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: A developed account might explain population growth (3 million to 4 million), enclosure (forcing farmers off the land), and inflation (prices up 400%, wages only doubled), showing how they combined to make poverty worse.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: A simple account might describe how enclosure and bad harvests meant more people became poor.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: More people were poor because there were not enough jobs or food.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain that the 1601 Poor Law was a landmark because it established that the wealthy should be taxed (through a compulsory poor rate) to pay for the care of the poor \u2014 making poverty a matter of government responsibility for the first time. Each parish had to appoint an Overseer of the Poor, provide relief for those who could not work, set up work for the able-bodied, and punish those who refused. It brought together earlier laws (1563 Statute of Artificers, 1572 Vagabonds Act, 1576 Poor Relief Act) into one national system. The law was partly inspired by successful local schemes in Norwich, York, and Ipswich. It remained the basis of poor relief for over 200 years, until the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act. However, it had weaknesses: relief was very small, enforcement varied by parish, and it did not fix root causes like enclosure and inflation.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: A developed answer might explain that the 1601 law created a national system of poor relief funded by a compulsory tax on the wealthy, and that it lasted over 200 years, but had weaknesses such as harsh conditions and inconsistent enforcement.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The 1601 Poor Law was important because it made the wealthy pay taxes to look after the poor for the first time.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The law was important because it helped poor people.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: A complex account might trace the shift over time. Under Henry VIII, the poor were mostly just punished. In the 1560s\u20131570s, there was widespread fear of \u2018sturdy beggars\u2019 and vagabonds \u2014 pamphlets by Thomas Harman created public panic, and the 1572 Vagabonds Act introduced whipping and ear-boring for beggars. People feared vagabonds spread plague, committed crime, and might cause rebellion. Over time, attitudes shifted: people began to accept that most vagabonds were ordinary unemployed people seeking work. Towns like Norwich, York, and Ipswich experimented with local schemes \u2014 licensing beggars, training children in trades, and surveying the poor to distinguish the idle from the genuinely needy. These local successes influenced national legislation, leading to the 1576 Poor Relief Act (providing raw materials for work) and the 1601 Poor Law (a comprehensive national system). The account might also note the distinction between helpless poor (deserving charity), deserving poor (given work), and idle poor (punished).\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence.

Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: A developed account might explain the fear of vagabonds (Thomas Harman\u2019s pamphlets, harsh punishments like whipping) and the gradual shift towards providing work and relief, inspired by local schemes in Norwich.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: A simple account might describe how people first feared beggars but later the government tried to help the poor find work.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain that the government distinguished between three categories: the helpless poor (old, sick, disabled \u2014 who deserved charity), the deserving poor (able-bodied but unemployed \u2014 who should be given work), and the idle poor or vagabonds (who chose not to work \u2014 who should be punished). This classification was important because it shaped the entire approach to poor relief. The 1601 Poor Law was built around it: relief for the helpless, raw materials and work for the deserving, and Houses of Correction for the idle. The distinction was also significant because attitudes evolved over time \u2014 people gradually recognised that many \u2018vagabonds\u2019 were actually ordinary unemployed people, not dangerous criminals. Towns like Norwich conducted surveys to separate the genuinely needy from the idle, which influenced national policy.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: A developed answer might explain the three categories (helpless, deserving, idle) and show how the 1601 Poor Law treated each differently \u2014 charity for the helpless, work for the deserving, and punishment for the idle.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The categories were important because they meant the government treated different types of poor people in different ways.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding.

Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain that towns like Norwich, York, and Ipswich pioneered local schemes before national legislation was passed. Norwich conducted detailed surveys to identify the genuinely poor and separate them from the idle. Towns licensed beggars, trained children in trades, and provided work materials. These local experiments demonstrated that a system based on classification and targeted support could work better than simply punishing all beggars. Their success influenced national legislation \u2014 the 1576 Poor Relief Act (providing raw materials for work) and especially the 1601 Poor Law (a comprehensive national system with Overseers, poor rates, and different treatment for different categories of poor).
