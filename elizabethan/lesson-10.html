        <h2>The Problem of the Poor</h2>

        <p>During Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign (1558&ndash;1603), England faced a growing problem of poverty and homelessness. The number of poor people increased dramatically, and the government had to develop new ways of dealing with the issue. This led to the Elizabethan Poor Laws, which were some of the first attempts in English history to make poverty a matter of <strong>government responsibility</strong> rather than just private charity.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Categories of Poor</div>
          <p>Elizabethans divided the poor into three groups:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The &lsquo;Helpless Poor&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; the old, sick, disabled, and very young who could not work</li>
            <li><strong>The &lsquo;Deserving Poor&rsquo;</strong> &mdash; those who wanted to work but could not find jobs</li>
            <li><strong>The &lsquo;Idle Poor&rsquo; (vagabonds)</strong> &mdash; those seen as choosing not to work; feared and punished</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Why Was Poverty Increasing?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Growing population:</strong> England&rsquo;s population rose from about 3 million in 1550 to over 4 million by 1600. More people meant more competition for jobs, food, and housing.</li>
          <li><strong>Bad harvests:</strong> A series of poor harvests, particularly in the 1590s, led to food shortages and rising prices. The harvests of 1594&ndash;1597 were especially bad.</li>
          <li><strong>Enclosure:</strong> Wealthy landowners enclosed common land to farm sheep for the profitable wool trade. This forced many small farmers off the land and into poverty.</li>
          <li><strong>Dissolution of the monasteries:</strong> Henry VIII had closed the monasteries in the 1530s. These had provided food, shelter, and medical care for the poor. Nothing had replaced them.</li>
          <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Prices rose much faster than wages. Between 1500 and 1600, food prices increased by around 400%, while wages only doubled.</li>
          <li><strong>Demobilised soldiers:</strong> Men returning from wars abroad (especially in the Netherlands and Ireland) often had no jobs to return to.</li>
          <li><strong>Decline of the cloth trade:</strong> The Antwerp cloth market collapsed in the 1550s, causing unemployment in English towns that depended on cloth-making.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Attitudes Towards the Poor</h3>

        <p>People in Elizabethan England had very different attitudes depending on which type of poor person they were considering:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sympathy for the helpless:</strong> Most people agreed that the old, sick, and disabled deserved help. Churches and wealthy individuals gave charity.</li>
          <li><strong>Fear of vagabonds:</strong> &lsquo;Sturdy beggars&rsquo; and vagrants were widely feared. People believed they spread disease, committed crimes, and might even cause rebellion. There was a strong belief that poverty was often the result of laziness.</li>
          <li><strong>Changing views:</strong> Over time, some people began to recognise that many of the poor were victims of circumstances beyond their control. Towns like Norwich and Ipswich experimented with local schemes to help the poor find work.</li>
        </ul>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>1563 &mdash; Statute of Artificers:</strong> JPs were given the power to raise money for poor relief. Refusing to pay could lead to imprisonment.</p>
              <p><strong>1572 &mdash; Vagabonds Act:</strong> A national poor rate (tax) was introduced. Vagabonds caught begging could be whipped and have a hole burned through their ear. Repeat offenders could be imprisoned or executed.</p>
              <p><strong>1576 &mdash; Poor Relief Act:</strong> Each town had to provide raw materials (like wool) so the able-bodied poor could work. &lsquo;Houses of Correction&rsquo; were set up for those who refused.</p>
              <p><strong>1601 &mdash; The Elizabethan Poor Law:</strong> This was the most important law. It brought together previous legislation into a single, comprehensive system. Each parish had to appoint an <strong>Overseer of the Poor</strong>, collect a compulsory poor rate, provide relief for those who could not work, set up work for the able-bodied, and punish those who refused to work.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The 1601 Poor Law</div>
          <p>The 1601 Elizabethan Poor Law was a landmark piece of legislation. It established the principle that the <strong>government had a responsibility</strong> to help the poor, and it remained the basis of poor relief in England for over <strong>200 years</strong>, until it was replaced by the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How Effective Were the Poor Laws?</h3>

        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Established a <strong>national system</strong> of poor relief for the first time</li>
          <li>Made poverty a matter of <strong>government responsibility</strong>, not just private charity</li>
          <li>Distinguished between different types of poor people and tried to treat them accordingly</li>
          <li>The system lasted for over 200 years, suggesting it worked reasonably well</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Relief was often <strong>very small</strong> and barely enough to survive on</li>
          <li>Conditions in workhouses and Houses of Correction were <strong>deliberately harsh</strong></li>
          <li>The laws <strong>did not address the root causes</strong> of poverty (enclosure, inflation, unemployment)</li>
          <li>Enforcement varied hugely from parish to parish &mdash; some were generous, others were not</li>
          <li>Punishments for vagabonds were extremely cruel and did little to solve the problem</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Don&rsquo;t just describe what the Poor Laws said &mdash; always link them to <strong>why</strong> they were introduced (causes of poverty) and <strong>how effective</strong> they were. A strong answer will evaluate the laws, explaining both their strengths (national system, government responsibility) and their limitations (harsh conditions, didn&rsquo;t solve root causes). Examiners reward answers that show <strong>judgement</strong>.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Poverty was a major and growing problem in Elizabethan England, driven by population growth, inflation, enclosure, bad harvests, and the loss of monastic charity. The government responded with a series of increasingly organised Poor Laws, culminating in the landmark 1601 Act. While the system was far from perfect and could be extremely harsh towards vagabonds, it represented a genuine shift towards government responsibility for the poor &mdash; a principle that would shape English social policy for centuries.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Poverty had many causes:</strong> Population growth, enclosure, inflation, bad harvests, and the collapse of monastic charity all contributed to the growing problem.</li>
          <li><strong>Attitudes were mixed:</strong> Elizabethans distinguished between the &lsquo;deserving&rsquo; and &lsquo;undeserving&rsquo; poor, showing sympathy to some but fear and cruelty towards others.</li>
          <li><strong>The 1601 Poor Law was a landmark:</strong> It created a national system of poor relief based on government responsibility that lasted over 200 years.</li>
        </ul>
