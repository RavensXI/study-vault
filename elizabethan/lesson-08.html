        <h2>Conflict with Spain &mdash; The Road to War</h2>

        <p>In <strong>1558</strong>, England and Spain were on reasonable terms. Philip II had even proposed marriage to Elizabeth. But over the next 30 years, relations fell apart &mdash; ending with the <strong>Spanish Armada in 1588</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Religious Differences</h3>

        <p><strong>Protestant England vs. Catholic Spain.</strong> Philip II saw himself as Catholicism&rsquo;s defender in Europe. Elizabeth&rsquo;s Religious Settlement (1559) made England officially Protestant, which Philip opposed. In <strong>1570</strong>, the Pope excommunicated Elizabeth, encouraging Catholic powers like Spain to act against her.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Philip II&rsquo;s Ambition</div>
          <p>Philip II was Europe&rsquo;s most powerful ruler. He controlled Spain, the Spanish Netherlands, large parts of Italy, and a vast American empire. He believed it was his <strong>religious duty</strong> to restore Catholicism to England &mdash; and he had the wealth and military to try.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Political and Personal Rivalry</h3>

        <p>Philip II had been King of England during his marriage to Mary I. He found it hard to accept England becoming a Protestant rival. As England grew in power under Elizabeth, the two nations were drawn into competition.</p>

        <h3>English Support for Dutch Rebels</h3>

        <p>The <strong>Netherlands</strong> was ruled by Spain, but many Dutch people were Protestant and resented harsh Spanish rule. A <strong>Dutch revolt</strong> had been going on since the 1560s. Elizabeth cautiously supported the rebels:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>She allowed Dutch rebel ships (&ldquo;Sea Beggars&rdquo;) to use English ports</li>
          <li>English volunteers fought alongside the Dutch</li>
          <li>In <strong>1585</strong>, Elizabeth signed the <strong>Treaty of Nonsuch</strong>, openly sending <strong>7,000 soldiers</strong> and money to help the Dutch &mdash; a key turning point</li>
          <li>The <strong>Earl of Leicester</strong> led the English forces in the Netherlands</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Treaty of Nonsuch, 1585</div>
          <p>The Treaty of Nonsuch was a <strong>turning point</strong>. By openly sending troops and money to Dutch rebels, Elizabeth was effectively declaring war on Spain. Philip saw it as direct aggression that justified military retaliation.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Rivalry at Sea</h3>

        <p>English <dfn class="term" data-def="Privately owned ships given unofficial royal permission to attack enemy vessels.">privateers</dfn> like <strong>Sir Francis Drake</strong> and <strong>Sir John Hawkins</strong> attacked Spanish treasure ships and ports in the Americas. Elizabeth secretly encouraged and profited from this.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>San Juan de Ul&uacute;a (1568):</strong> Spanish forces attacked English ships in a Mexican port, increasing bitterness between the two nations</li>
          <li><strong>Drake&rsquo;s circumnavigation (1577&ndash;1580):</strong> Drake sailed around the world, plundering huge amounts of Spanish treasure. Elizabeth took a share of the profits and knighted Drake on his return</li>
          <li><strong>Drake&rsquo;s raid on Cadiz (1587):</strong> Drake attacked Cadiz, destroying ships and supplies being prepared for the Armada &mdash; known as &ldquo;singeing the King of Spain&rsquo;s beard&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mary, Queen of Scots</h3>

        <p>Philip II supported Catholic plots to overthrow Elizabeth and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots. He funded missionaries and plotters in England. Mary&rsquo;s <strong>execution in February 1587</strong> was the final straw &mdash; it removed the Catholic claimant Philip had hoped to put on the throne and gave him a personal reason for revenge.</p>

        <h3>How the Causes Connected</h3>

        <p>No single factor caused the conflict. These causes <strong>built on each other</strong> over nearly 30 years:</p>

      <!-- Exam Tip -->
      <div class="exam-tip">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Do not treat the conflict with Spain as a single-cause event. Show how <strong>multiple factors</strong> &mdash; religious, political, economic &mdash; built up tension over time. Use dates to show the escalation, and identify the <strong>Treaty of Nonsuch (1585)</strong> as the key turning point.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Anglo-Spanish relations collapsed over 30 years. Religious divisions, Philip&rsquo;s ambition, English support for Dutch rebels, privateering, and the plots around Mary, Queen of Scots all pushed the two nations towards war. By 1587, conflict was almost unavoidable.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple connected causes:</strong> Religion, politics, privateering, the Dutch revolt, and Mary&rsquo;s execution all contributed to the breakdown.</li>
          <li><strong>Treaty of Nonsuch (1585):</strong> Elizabeth&rsquo;s open military support for Dutch rebels made war with Spain almost certain.</li>
          <li><strong>Mary&rsquo;s execution (1587):</strong> Gave Philip II both the personal motivation and political justification to launch the Armada.</li>
        </ul>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: A complex account might trace the breakdown over 30 years: religious differences (Philip II saw himself as Catholicism\u2019s defender; the Pope excommunicated Elizabeth in 1570), the Dutch revolt (Elizabeth allowed Sea Beggars to use English ports and signed the Treaty of Nonsuch in 1585, sending 7,000 troops under the Earl of Leicester), privateering (Drake\u2019s circumnavigation 1577\u20131580 and raid on Cadiz 1587), and the Catholic plots culminating in Mary\u2019s execution in February 1587. The answer might show how these factors built on each other \u2014 each provocation made the next more likely, until war became almost unavoidable.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: A developed account might explain two or three causes in detail, such as the Treaty of Nonsuch (openly sending troops to Dutch rebels) and Drake\u2019s privateering (stealing Spanish treasure and raiding Cadiz), showing how each worsened relations.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: A simple account might describe how England supported Dutch rebels and Drake attacked Spanish ships, making Philip angry.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: England and Spain fell out because of religion and fighting.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain that the Treaty of Nonsuch was a turning point because Elizabeth moved from covert support for Dutch rebels (allowing Sea Beggars to use English ports, permitting volunteers) to open military commitment \u2014 sending 7,000 soldiers and money under the Earl of Leicester. Philip II saw this as direct aggression that justified military retaliation. Combined with Drake\u2019s privateering and Mary\u2019s execution (1587), it made the Armada almost inevitable. The treaty was important not just for Anglo-Spanish relations but also for the Dutch revolt, as English support helped the northern Netherlands move towards independence.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: A developed answer might explain that the treaty was a turning point because it openly committed England to war against Spain by sending 7,000 troops to the Netherlands, and that Philip saw it as justification for the Armada.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The Treaty of Nonsuch was important because Elizabeth sent soldiers to help Dutch rebels fight Spain, which made Philip want revenge.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The treaty made Spain angry because England helped the Dutch.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: A complex account might trace English involvement from cautious to open: Elizabeth first allowed Dutch rebel ships (\u2018Sea Beggars\u2019) to use English ports. English volunteers fought alongside the Dutch. In 1585, the Treaty of Nonsuch marked a turning point \u2014 Elizabeth openly sent 7,000 soldiers and money, with the Earl of Leicester leading English forces. This was effectively a declaration of war against Spain. The consequences were significant: it provoked Philip II towards the Armada (1588), but English support also helped the northern Netherlands become independent, which benefited English trade. The account might link this to broader Anglo-Spanish tensions including religion and privateering.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: A developed account might explain the progression from allowing Sea Beggars to use ports to the Treaty of Nonsuch (1585), showing how English involvement escalated and provoked Spain.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: A simple account might describe how Elizabeth sent troops to help the Dutch rebels, which angered Spain.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: England helped the Dutch fight Spain.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        text: "Explain what was important about English privateering for Anglo-Spanish relations.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain that English privateers like Drake and Hawkins attacked Spanish treasure ships and ports, stealing vast wealth \u2014 Drake once took \u00a330,000 in a single raid (about \u00a315 million today). Elizabeth secretly encouraged and profited from this. Key events included the attack at San Juan de Ul\u00faa (1568) which increased bitterness, Drake\u2019s circumnavigation (1577\u20131580) which plundered huge amounts of Spanish treasure (Elizabeth knighted Drake on his return), and Drake\u2019s raid on Cadiz (1587) which destroyed ships being prepared for the Armada. Privateering was important because it directly harmed Spanish wealth and prestige, and Philip saw it as state-sponsored piracy that justified retaliation.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: A developed answer might explain Drake\u2019s circumnavigation (stealing Spanish treasure) and his raid on Cadiz (delaying the Armada), showing how privateering both enriched England and provoked Spain.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Privateering was important because Drake attacked Spanish ships and stole treasure, which made Philip angry.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: English pirates attacked Spanish ships, which caused tension.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: A complex account might explain that Philip II was Europe\u2019s most powerful Catholic ruler, controlling Spain, the Spanish Netherlands, parts of Italy, and a vast American empire. He believed it was his religious duty to restore Catholicism to England. Elizabeth\u2019s Religious Settlement (1559) made England officially Protestant, which Philip opposed. The Pope excommunicated Elizabeth in 1570, encouraging Catholic powers to act. Philip supported Catholic plots in England and funded missionaries. Mary\u2019s execution in 1587 removed the Catholic claimant Philip hoped to enthrone and gave him personal motivation for revenge. Religion was intertwined with other causes \u2014 the Dutch revolt was partly religious (Protestant Dutch vs Catholic Spain), and the papal bull encouraged the plots that deepened Anglo-Spanish hostility.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: A developed account might explain that Philip saw himself as Catholicism\u2019s defender and opposed Elizabeth\u2019s Protestant Settlement, and that the Pope\u2019s excommunication of Elizabeth (1570) encouraged Catholic plots that Philip supported.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: A simple account might explain that Philip was Catholic and Elizabeth was Protestant, so they disagreed about religion.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: England and Spain fought because of religion.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain that Philip II had supported Catholic plots to overthrow Elizabeth and replace her with Mary. Her execution on 8 February 1587 removed the Catholic claimant Philip had hoped to put on the throne through diplomacy, meaning invasion was now the only option. It gave Philip both personal motivation (revenge for a Catholic queen\u2019s death) and political justification (defending Catholicism). However, Mary\u2019s execution was not the sole cause \u2014 it built on existing tensions from the Treaty of Nonsuch (1585), Drake\u2019s privateering, the Dutch revolt, and the papal excommunication (1570). The execution was the \u2018final straw\u2019 that tipped the balance towards the Armada in 1588.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: A developed answer might explain that the execution removed Philip\u2019s hope of placing a Catholic queen on the throne peacefully, making invasion seem necessary, and that it built on existing tensions like the Treaty of Nonsuch.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Mary\u2019s execution was important because it gave Philip a reason to launch the Armada to get revenge.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding.
