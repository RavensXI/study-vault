        <h2>Conflict with Spain &mdash; The Road to War</h2>

        <p>At the start of Elizabeth I&rsquo;s reign in <strong>1558</strong>, England and Spain were reasonably friendly. Philip II of Spain had even proposed marriage to Elizabeth. However, relations gradually worsened over the next 30 years, leading to the <strong>Spanish Armada in 1588</strong>. Understanding the multiple causes of this conflict is essential for the exam.</p>

        <h3>Religious Differences</h3>

        <p><strong>Protestant England vs. Catholic Spain.</strong> Philip II saw himself as the defender of Catholicism in Europe. Elizabeth&rsquo;s Religious Settlement of 1559 made England officially Protestant, which Philip deeply opposed. In <strong>1570</strong>, the Pope excommunicated Elizabeth, encouraging Catholic powers like Spain to act against her.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Philip II&rsquo;s Ambition</div>
          <p>Philip II of Spain was the most powerful ruler in Europe. He controlled Spain, the Spanish Netherlands (modern Belgium and the Netherlands), large parts of Italy, and a vast empire in the Americas. He genuinely believed it was his <strong>religious duty</strong> to restore Catholicism to England, and he had the wealth and military power to attempt it.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Political and Personal Rivalry</h3>

        <p>Spain was the dominant European power with a vast empire. Philip II had been King of England during his marriage to Mary I and found it hard to accept England becoming a Protestant rival. As England grew in confidence and power under Elizabeth, the two nations were increasingly drawn into competition.</p>

        <h3>English Support for Dutch Rebels</h3>

        <p>The <strong>Netherlands</strong> was ruled by Spain, but many Dutch people were Protestant and resented harsh Spanish rule. A <strong>Dutch revolt</strong> against Spain had been going on since the 1560s. Elizabeth cautiously supported the Dutch rebels:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>She allowed Dutch rebel ships (&ldquo;Sea Beggars&rdquo;) to use English ports</li>
          <li>English volunteers fought alongside the Dutch</li>
          <li>In <strong>1585</strong>, Elizabeth signed the <strong>Treaty of Nonsuch</strong>, openly agreeing to send <strong>7,000 soldiers</strong> and money to help the Dutch &mdash; this was a key turning point</li>
          <li>The <strong>Earl of Leicester</strong> was sent to lead the English forces in the Netherlands</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Treaty of Nonsuch, 1585</div>
          <p>The Treaty of Nonsuch was a <strong>turning point</strong> in Anglo-Spanish relations. By openly sending troops and money to help the Dutch rebels, Elizabeth was effectively declaring war on Spain. Philip II saw this as a direct act of aggression that justified military retaliation.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Rivalry at Sea</h3>

        <p>English <strong>privateers</strong> (privately owned ships with unofficial royal permission) like <strong>Sir Francis Drake</strong> and <strong>Sir John Hawkins</strong> attacked Spanish treasure ships and ports in the Americas. Elizabeth secretly encouraged and profited from these activities.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The attack at <strong>San Juan de Ul&uacute;a</strong> (1568) &mdash; Spanish forces attacked English ships in a Mexican port, increasing bitterness between the two nations</li>
          <li><strong>Drake&rsquo;s circumnavigation</strong> (1577&ndash;1580) &mdash; Drake sailed around the world, plundering vast amounts of Spanish treasure along the way. Elizabeth received a share of the profits and knighted Drake on his return.</li>
          <li><strong>Drake&rsquo;s raid on Cadiz</strong> (1587) &mdash; Drake attacked the Spanish port of Cadiz, destroying ships and supplies being prepared for the Armada. This was known as &ldquo;singeing the King of Spain&rsquo;s beard.&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mary, Queen of Scots</h3>

        <p>Philip II supported various Catholic plots to overthrow Elizabeth and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots. He funded Catholic missionaries and plotters in England. Mary&rsquo;s <strong>execution in February 1587</strong> was the final straw for Philip &mdash; it removed the Catholic claimant he had hoped to put on the English throne and gave him a personal motivation for revenge.</p>

        <h3>How the Causes Connected</h3>

        <p>No single factor caused the conflict. Instead, these causes <strong>built on each other</strong> over nearly 30 years:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Religious differences created suspicion and hostility</li>
          <li>English privateering damaged Spain economically and angered Philip</li>
          <li>English support for Dutch rebels threatened Spain&rsquo;s control of the Netherlands</li>
          <li>Catholic plots linked Spain to attempts to overthrow Elizabeth</li>
          <li>Mary&rsquo;s execution provided Philip with his final justification</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Exam Tip -->
      <div class="exam-tip">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Avoid presenting the conflict with Spain as a single-cause event. Show the <strong>interconnectedness</strong> of multiple factors &mdash; religious, political, economic, and individual actions &mdash; building up tension over time. Examiners want to see that you understand how these causes <strong>combined and escalated</strong>. Use dates to show the chronological build-up of tension, and identify the <strong>Treaty of Nonsuch (1585)</strong> as the key turning point.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Relations between England and Spain soured dramatically over 30 years. What began as a manageable relationship deteriorated due to deep religious divisions, Philip II&rsquo;s ambition, Elizabeth&rsquo;s support for Dutch rebels, English privateering, and plots surrounding Mary, Queen of Scots. By 1587, direct conflict seemed almost inevitable.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple interconnected causes:</strong> Religion, politics, trade, privateering, the Dutch revolt, and Mary&rsquo;s execution all contributed to the breakdown in relations.</li>
          <li><strong>The Treaty of Nonsuch (1585):</strong> Elizabeth&rsquo;s open military support for the Dutch rebels was the key turning point that made war with Spain almost certain.</li>
          <li><strong>A gradual escalation:</strong> Tensions built up over nearly 30 years, with each provocation leading to a harsher response from the other side.</li>
          <li><strong>Mary&rsquo;s execution (1587):</strong> Provided Philip II with the personal motivation and political justification to launch the Spanish Armada.</li>
        </ul>
