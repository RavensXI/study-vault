        <h2>The Marriage &amp; Succession Problem</h2>

        <p>Elizabeth was <strong>25</strong> when she became queen, and everyone assumed she would marry quickly. The question of <strong>who she would marry</strong> and <strong>who would succeed her</strong> dominated her entire reign.</p>

        <h3>Why Was Marriage a Big Deal?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Producing an heir:</strong> Elizabeth was the last of Henry VIII&rsquo;s children. If she died without an heir, the <dfn class="term" data-def="The royal family descended from Henry VII, which included Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I.">Tudor dynasty</dfn> would die with her &mdash; risking civil war.</li>
          <li><strong>Keeping out Mary, Queen of Scots:</strong> Without a Protestant heir, the Catholic Mary Stuart had the strongest claim to the throne. Marriage and children would block her path.</li>
          <li><strong>A woman ruler:</strong> Many believed a woman could not rule alone and needed a husband to govern. How could she lead an army into battle?</li>
          <li><strong>Alliances:</strong> Marriage could seal a powerful alliance with another country.</li>
          <li><strong>Danger of the wrong choice:</strong> A foreign husband might drag England into wars. An English one might cause jealousy and rebellion among rival nobles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Potential Suitors</h3>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (English)</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Dudley and Elizabeth had been childhood friends. They spent hours together almost every day &mdash; he was clearly her favourite. He was a Protestant, which suited England&rsquo;s religious settlement.</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Dudley was already married. In <strong>1560</strong>, his wife <strong>Amy Robsart</strong> was found dead after falling down stairs. Rivals spread rumours that Dudley had murdered her so he could marry Elizabeth. The scandal was so great that Dudley had to be <strong>banished from court</strong> for a time. Marrying him would have caused huge jealousy among other nobles.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>King Philip II of Spain (Spanish)</span>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> King of the most powerful country in Europe. A match would seal a strong alliance against France.</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Philip had been married to Elizabeth&rsquo;s sister <strong>Mary I</strong>, and this had been very unpopular. England had been dragged into Spain&rsquo;s wars, and as a result lost the port of <strong>Calais</strong> to France. Philip was fiercely Catholic and wanted to turn all of Europe back to Catholicism. He proposed marriage, but Elizabeth never seriously considered it &mdash; and the rejection angered him.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> A genuine contender later in the reign. He regularly visited Elizabeth&rsquo;s court in the 1570s, and she was fond of him &mdash; calling him her <strong>&ldquo;little frog.&rdquo;</strong> A French alliance would help counter Spain.</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Catholic &mdash; and he refused to give up his religion during negotiations. He was about <strong>21 years younger</strong> than Elizabeth. The <strong>St Bartholomew&rsquo;s Day Massacre</strong> (1572), in which thousands of French Protestants were killed, turned English public opinion strongly against a French Catholic prince. By the 1580s, Elizabeth was considered too old to have children.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Marriage as Diplomacy</div>
          <p>Elizabeth used the <strong>possibility</strong> of marriage as a diplomatic tool for over 25 years. She kept foreign suitors interested, playing rival powers off against each other &mdash; without ever committing. In <strong>1566</strong>, she told Parliament: <em>&ldquo;At present it is not convenient; nor never shall be without some peril unto you and certain danger unto me.&rdquo;</em></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Why Did Elizabeth Never Marry?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keeping her independence:</strong> Tudor men were in charge of their wives. By not marrying, Elizabeth kept all the power for herself.</li>
          <li><strong>No good option:</strong> A foreign husband could drag England under foreign control. An English one would provoke jealousy and possibly rebellion.</li>
          <li><strong>Danger of childbirth:</strong> Giving birth was risky &mdash; it often resulted in death. Elizabeth had seen her sister Mary I fail to produce an heir despite her marriage.</li>
          <li><strong>Past experience:</strong> Mary I&rsquo;s marriage to Philip II had been hated. Elizabeth&rsquo;s own mother, Anne Boleyn, had been executed by Henry VIII.</li>
          <li><strong>The &ldquo;Virgin Queen&rdquo; image:</strong> Elizabeth built the image of being married only to her kingdom. This became powerful propaganda.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>You may be asked a &ldquo;how convincing&rdquo; question about why Elizabeth did not marry. Cover both <strong>personal</strong> and <strong>political</strong> reasons. Explain the pros and cons of each suitor with <strong>specific examples</strong> &mdash; e.g. Mary I&rsquo;s marriage to Philip leading to the loss of Calais, or the Dudley scandal.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Elizabeth faced constant pressure to marry, but every option carried serious risks. She turned the problem into a strength &mdash; using marriage talks as diplomacy and building the &ldquo;Virgin Queen&rdquo; image.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Constant pressure:</strong> Parliament and the Privy Council pushed Elizabeth to marry and produce an heir. Without one, the Tudor dynasty would end and Catholic Mary Stuart was next in line.</li>
          <li><strong>Every option had drawbacks:</strong> A foreign husband risked dragging England into wars (as Philip II had done). An English one risked jealousy and rebellion (as the Dudley scandal showed).</li>
          <li><strong>A deliberate strategy:</strong> Elizabeth used marriage talks as a diplomatic tool for over 25 years, keeping rivals guessing while holding onto her power.</li>
        </ul>
