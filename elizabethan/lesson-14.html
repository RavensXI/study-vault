        <h2>Threats to Elizabeth&rsquo;s Rule</h2>

        <p>Throughout her reign, Elizabeth faced serious threats to her power, her Protestant settlement, and her life. These came from <strong>Catholic plots</strong>, <strong>Mary, Queen of Scots</strong>, <strong>Spain</strong>, <strong>Puritans</strong>, and the <strong>succession crisis</strong>. This lesson brings them all together and asks: <em>how serious was each one, and which was the greatest danger?</em></p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_threats_comparison.png" alt="Threat-level comparison infographic ranking the five main threats to Elizabeth I: Spain (highest), Mary Queen of Scots (high), Catholic plots (medium-high), succession crisis (medium), Puritans (low-medium)">
        </figure>

        <h3>1. The Catholic Threat</h3>

        <p>The Catholic threat was persistent and came from inside and outside England. The <strong>Papal Bull of 1570</strong> (<em>Regnans in Excelsis</em>) excommunicated Elizabeth and told Catholics they did not have to obey her. This gave plotters the Pope&rsquo;s permission to overthrow or assassinate the Queen.</p>

        <h4>The Major Catholic Plots</h4>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Catholic plots in detail</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>The Ridolfi Plot (1571):</strong> Italian banker Roberto Ridolfi planned to use Spanish troops to overthrow Elizabeth and put Mary on the throne. The Duke of Norfolk was involved. <strong>William Cecil</strong> discovered the plot, and Norfolk was executed in 1572. It showed Catholic plots had foreign backing, but was poorly organised.</p>
              <p><strong>The Throckmorton Plot (1583):</strong> Francis Throckmorton acted as go-between for Mary and the Spanish ambassador. The plan involved a French invasion backed by Spain and the Pope. <strong>Walsingham&rsquo;s</strong> spy network uncovered it. Throckmorton was tortured and executed. The Spanish ambassador was expelled from England.</p>
              <p><strong>The Babington Plot (1586):</strong> The most serious plot. Anthony Babington planned to assassinate Elizabeth, free Mary, and trigger a Catholic uprising backed by Spain. Walsingham intercepted coded letters showing <strong>Mary approved the assassination</strong>. This gave the evidence to put Mary on trial. Babington and his co-conspirators were executed.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h4>How Serious Was the Catholic Threat?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Serious because:</strong> The plots had foreign backing (Spain, the Pope), involved assassination plans, and could have triggered invasion. Seminary priests and Jesuits kept Catholicism alive in England from the 1570s.</li>
          <li><strong>Less serious because:</strong> Most English Catholics were loyal and did not support violence. The plots were poorly organised and Walsingham&rsquo;s spy network caught every one. The plotters never had enough support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Mary, Queen of Scots</h3>

        <p>Mary Stuart was Elizabeth&rsquo;s Catholic cousin with a strong claim to the English throne. After being forced to abdicate in Scotland, she fled to England in <strong>1568</strong> and was kept under house arrest for <strong>19 years</strong>. She became the focal point of every Catholic plot against Elizabeth.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Mary&rsquo;s Execution</div>
          <p>After the Babington Plot proved Mary supported assassination plans, she was tried, found guilty, and <strong>executed on 8 February 1587</strong> at Fotheringhay Castle. Elizabeth hesitated for months, knowing it set a dangerous precedent and would likely provoke Spain.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>How Serious Was the Threat from Mary?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Serious because:</strong> Mary had a legitimate claim to the throne and was the figurehead of every major Catholic plot. As long as she lived, Catholic conspirators had someone to rally around.</li>
          <li><strong>Less serious because:</strong> Mary was a prisoner with no army, no resources, and no freedom. She relied on others who repeatedly failed. Her execution in 1587 ended the threat.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Spain</h3>

        <p>Spain under <strong>Philip II</strong> was the most powerful country in Europe, with vast wealth from its American empire and the strongest military. Philip saw himself as the defender of the Catholic faith.</p>

        <h4>How Serious Was the Spanish Threat?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Serious because:</strong> Spain had the resources to mount a real invasion. The 1588 Armada was the largest naval force ever assembled at that time. Spain backed Catholic plots and could have combined invasion with internal rebellion. Two further armadas were sent in 1596 and 1597.</li>
          <li><strong>Less serious because:</strong> The Armada failed due to English tactics, better ships, and storms. Spain was also fighting in the Netherlands and could not focus fully on England. The later armadas were destroyed by weather. Spain never landed troops on English soil.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. The Puritan Challenge</h3>

        <p>Puritans were extreme Protestants who believed the 1559 Religious Settlement did not go far enough. They wanted simpler services, no vestments, no bishops, and a &lsquo;purer&rsquo; form of worship.</p>

        <h4>How Serious Was the Puritan Threat?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Serious because:</strong> Puritans challenged Elizabeth&rsquo;s authority as Supreme Governor. Some Puritan MPs tried to push reforms through Parliament. The &lsquo;Marprelate Tracts&rsquo; (1588&ndash;89) openly mocked bishops. Puritans had support among powerful figures.</li>
          <li><strong>Less serious because:</strong> Puritans never threatened Elizabeth&rsquo;s life or plotted to overthrow her &mdash; they wanted to <strong>reform the Church</strong>, not remove the Queen. They had no foreign backing or military power. Archbishop Whitgift suppressed organised opposition by the 1590s.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. The Succession Crisis</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth never married and never named an heir. If she died suddenly, there was no clear successor &mdash; risking <strong>civil war</strong>, foreign intervention, or the collapse of the Protestant settlement.</p>

        <h4>How Serious Was the Succession Threat?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Serious because:</strong> Without a clear heir, Elizabeth&rsquo;s death could have caused chaos. Parliament repeatedly pressed her to marry or name a successor. The uncertainty encouraged Catholic plots, since Mary was a possible alternative. It also gave Spain an opening.</li>
          <li><strong>Less serious because:</strong> Elizabeth survived until 1603. Robert Cecil secretly arranged the smooth succession of <strong>James VI of Scotland</strong> (James I of England). The peaceful transition suggests the threat never became a real crisis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Which Threat Was the Most Dangerous?</h3>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Making a Judgement</div>
          <p>There is no single right answer &mdash; what matters is <strong>justifying your argument with evidence</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mary, Queen of Scots</strong> connected all the Catholic threats. Without her, plotters had no realistic candidate to replace Elizabeth.</li>
            <li><strong>Spain</strong> was the only threat with the military power to invade. If the Armada had succeeded, it would have been catastrophic.</li>
            <li><strong>The combination</strong> was what made it truly dangerous. Mary + Catholic plots + Spanish military power + the succession crisis created a web of linked threats.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>How Elizabeth Dealt with the Threats</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Walsingham&rsquo;s spy network:</strong> His intelligence service infiltrated Catholic networks, intercepted letters, and uncovered plots before they could succeed.</li>
          <li><strong>Harsh anti-Catholic laws:</strong> From the 1580s, it was treason to be a Catholic priest in England. Recusancy fines rose. Seminary priests and Jesuits were hunted and often executed.</li>
          <li><strong>Mary&rsquo;s execution (1587):</strong> Removed the figurehead of Catholic opposition, though it provoked Spain.</li>
          <li><strong>Military investment:</strong> Spending on the navy paid off with the Armada&rsquo;s defeat in 1588.</li>
          <li><strong>The Religious Settlement:</strong> The &lsquo;middle way&rsquo; satisfied most people, isolating Catholic and Puritan extremists.</li>
          <li><strong>Control of Parliament:</strong> Elizabeth used her prerogative to block Parliament on marriage, succession, and religious reform.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Exam Tip -->
      <div class="exam-tip">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Threat questions ask you to <strong>evaluate</strong> or <strong>compare</strong>. (1) Explain each threat with specific evidence (names, dates, events). (2) Assess how serious it was &mdash; what could have happened if it succeeded? (3) Show how threats were <strong>interconnected</strong> (Mary linked to Catholic plots, which were backed by Spain). (4) Reach a clear <strong>judgement</strong> about which was most dangerous. The best answers argue, not just describe.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Elizabeth faced threats from Catholic plots, Mary Queen of Scots, Spain, Puritans, and the succession crisis. The most dangerous were those that combined together &mdash; Mary as figurehead, Catholic conspiracies, and Spanish military power. She survived through shrewd judgement, Walsingham&rsquo;s spies, military investment, and some good fortune.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Threats were interconnected:</strong> Catholic plots, Mary, and Spain were closely linked &mdash; together they were far more dangerous than alone.</li>
          <li><strong>Walsingham&rsquo;s spy network was crucial:</strong> He uncovered every major Catholic plot before it could succeed.</li>
          <li><strong>Elizabeth managed threats skilfully:</strong> Diplomacy, the Religious Settlement, naval strength, and careful use of power kept her on the throne for 45 years.</li>
        </ul>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: The Papal Bull was important because it fundamentally changed the nature of the Catholic threat. By excommunicating Elizabeth and declaring her subjects did not have to obey her, Pope Pius V gave Catholic plotters religious permission to overthrow or assassinate the Queen. This transformed domestic Catholicism from a quiet matter of private belief into a potential act of treason. Every subsequent plot \u2014 Ridolfi (1571), Throckmorton (1583), and Babington (1586) \u2014 drew legitimacy from the Bull. It also gave Elizabeth\u2019s government justification for increasingly harsh anti-Catholic legislation: recusancy fines were raised, seminary priests were made illegal, and from the 1580s it was treason to be a Catholic priest in England. Around 200 Catholics were executed. However, most English Catholics remained loyal to the Queen, suggesting the Bull had more impact on government policy than on ordinary people\u2019s loyalties.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: The Papal Bull was important because it told Catholics they did not have to obey Elizabeth. This encouraged plots like Ridolfi, Throckmorton, and Babington. It also led to harsher laws \u2014 recusancy fines increased and it became treason to be a Catholic priest. However, most English Catholics stayed loyal.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The Papal Bull was important because it encouraged Catholics to plot against Elizabeth. Several plots followed, including the Babington Plot.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The Pope said Catholics did not have to obey Elizabeth, which caused problems.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Foreign threats to Elizabeth came from multiple directions and were interconnected. Spain was the greatest threat \u2014 Philip II saw himself as the champion of Catholicism and was angered by English privateering, support for the Dutch revolt, and the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots. This culminated in the Armada of 1588, which aimed to invade England with 130 ships and 30,000 men. The Pope supported these efforts through the Papal Bull of 1570, which gave Catholics permission to overthrow Elizabeth, and by funding Catholic seminaries that trained priests to return to England secretly. France was a lesser threat but still a concern \u2014 the powerful Guise family (Mary\u2019s relatives) had connections to Catholic plots. Foreign powers also operated through domestic intermediaries: the Ridolfi Plot involved Spain, the Throckmorton Plot involved the Spanish ambassador Mendoza, and the Babington Plot had links to both Spain and the papacy. Walsingham\u2019s spy network abroad was essential in monitoring these threats.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: Spain was the main foreign threat. Philip II was angry about English privateering and support for the Dutch revolt. He launched the Armada in 1588. The Pope also threatened Elizabeth by excommunicating her in 1570 and funding Catholic seminaries. Catholic plots like Throckmorton and Babington had foreign backing.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Spain threatened England and sent the Armada in 1588. The Pope excommunicated Elizabeth in 1570. Catholic plots were supported by foreign powers.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: Spain and the Pope were threats to Elizabeth.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: Walsingham\u2019s spy network was important because it was the main reason every major Catholic plot against Elizabeth was uncovered before it could succeed. Walsingham employed agents across England and Europe, intercepted coded letters, and used double agents to infiltrate Catholic networks. His greatest success was the Babington Plot (1586): he allowed coded letters between Mary and Babington to continue, using the cipher expert Thomas Phelippes to decode them. This provided the evidence that Mary had approved Elizabeth\u2019s assassination, leading directly to Mary\u2019s trial and execution. The spy network also uncovered the Throckmorton Plot (1583), which led to the expulsion of the Spanish ambassador Mendoza. In a broader sense, Walsingham\u2019s intelligence work was important because it shifted the balance of power: Catholic plotters could never be sure their communications were safe, which deterred many potential conspiracies.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: Walsingham\u2019s spy network was important because it uncovered every major Catholic plot. He intercepted coded Babington Plot letters, providing evidence for Mary\u2019s execution. He also uncovered the Throckmorton Plot, which led to the Spanish ambassador being expelled. His network made it very difficult for plotters to communicate safely.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Walsingham\u2019s spy network was important because it uncovered the Babington Plot.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: The Catholic threat was important because it was persistent, had foreign backing, and was linked to other dangers. The Papal Bull of 1570 (Regnans in Excelsis) excommunicated Elizabeth and told Catholics they did not have to obey her, giving plotters the Pope\u2019s permission to overthrow or assassinate the Queen. A series of plots followed \u2014 Ridolfi (1571), Throckmorton (1583), and Babington (1586) \u2014 each involving plans for foreign invasion and/or assassination. Crucially, these plots centred on Mary, Queen of Scots as an alternative monarch, connecting the Catholic threat to the succession crisis. The Babington Plot was particularly important because Walsingham\u2019s spy network intercepted coded letters proving Mary approved the assassination, providing the evidence for her trial and execution in 1587. However, most English Catholics were actually loyal and never supported violence, suggesting the threat was more from foreign powers than from domestic Catholics.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: The Catholic threat was important because several plots aimed to kill Elizabeth and put Mary on the throne. The Babington Plot (1586) was the most serious \u2014 Walsingham intercepted letters showing Mary approved the assassination. This threat was backed by Spain and the Pope. However, Walsingham\u2019s spy network caught every plot.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The Catholic threat was important because plots like the Babington Plot aimed to assassinate Elizabeth and replace her with Mary. These had backing from Spain and the Pope.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding.

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Elizabeth dealt with threats through a combination of intelligence, legislation, diplomacy, and military strength. Walsingham\u2019s spy network was central \u2014 he infiltrated Catholic networks, intercepted coded letters, and uncovered every major plot (Ridolfi, Throckmorton, Babington) before they could succeed. From the 1580s, harsh anti-Catholic laws made it treason to be a Catholic priest in England, and recusancy fines rose. Mary\u2019s execution in 1587 removed the figurehead of Catholic opposition, though Elizabeth hesitated for months knowing it would provoke Spain. Military investment paid off when the English fleet defeated the Armada in 1588, using faster ships and fireships at Calais. The Religious Settlement of 1559 created a \u2018middle way\u2019 that satisfied most people, isolating extremists on both sides. Elizabeth also used her royal prerogative to block Parliament on sensitive issues like marriage and the succession. This multi-layered approach \u2014 combining intelligence, law, religion, and military power \u2014 kept her on the throne for 45 years.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: Elizabeth used Walsingham\u2019s spy network to uncover Catholic plots like the Babington Plot. She passed harsh anti-Catholic laws making it treason to be a priest. Mary\u2019s execution in 1587 removed the focus of Catholic plotting. She invested in the navy, which helped defeat the Armada in 1588. The Religious Settlement kept most people satisfied.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: Mary\u2019s execution was important because it had wide-reaching consequences for Elizabeth\u2019s security and for Anglo-Spanish relations. Mary had been the focal point of every Catholic plot for 19 years \u2014 the Ridolfi, Throckmorton, and Babington plots all aimed to put her on the throne. The Babington Plot provided the crucial evidence: Walsingham intercepted coded letters proving Mary had approved Elizabeth\u2019s assassination. Her execution at Fotheringhay Castle on 8 February 1587 removed the figurehead of Catholic opposition, meaning future plotters had no realistic alternative monarch. However, Elizabeth hesitated for months because she recognised the dangers \u2014 executing an anointed queen set a dangerous precedent and was likely to provoke Spain. Indeed, Mary\u2019s death was one of the factors that pushed Philip II to launch the Armada in 1588. So while the execution removed one threat, it directly contributed to another.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: Mary\u2019s execution was important because she had been the focus of every Catholic plot against Elizabeth. The Babington Plot proved she approved assassination plans. Once she was executed, plotters had no one to rally around. However, it was also important because it provoked Spain and was one reason Philip II launched the Armada in 1588.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Mary\u2019s execution was important because it ended the threat from Catholic plotters. Mary had been involved in the Babington Plot and had been a prisoner for 19 years.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Mary was executed because she plotted against Elizabeth.
