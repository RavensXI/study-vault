        <h2>Threats to Elizabeth&rsquo;s Rule</h2>

        <p>Throughout her reign, Elizabeth faced serious threats to her power, her Protestant settlement, and her life. These came from <strong>Catholic plots</strong>, <strong>Mary, Queen of Scots</strong>, <strong>Spain</strong>, <strong>Puritans</strong>, and the <strong>succession crisis</strong>. This lesson brings them all together and asks: <em>how serious was each one, and which was the greatest danger?</em></p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_threats_comparison.png" alt="Threat-level comparison infographic ranking the five main threats to Elizabeth I: Spain (highest), Mary Queen of Scots (high), Catholic plots (medium-high), succession crisis (medium), Puritans (low-medium)">
        </figure>

        <h3>1. The Catholic Threat</h3>

        <p>The Catholic threat was persistent and came from inside and outside England. The <strong>Papal Bull of 1570</strong> (<em>Regnans in Excelsis</em>) excommunicated Elizabeth and told Catholics they did not have to obey her. This gave plotters the Pope&rsquo;s permission to overthrow or assassinate the Queen.</p>

        <h4>The Major Catholic Plots</h4>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Catholic plots in detail</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>The Ridolfi Plot (1571):</strong> Italian banker Roberto Ridolfi planned to use Spanish troops to overthrow Elizabeth and put Mary on the throne. The Duke of Norfolk was involved. <strong>William Cecil</strong> discovered the plot, and Norfolk was executed in 1572. It showed Catholic plots had foreign backing, but was poorly organised.</p>
              <p><strong>The Throckmorton Plot (1583):</strong> Francis Throckmorton acted as go-between for Mary and the Spanish ambassador. The plan involved a French invasion backed by Spain and the Pope. <strong>Walsingham&rsquo;s</strong> spy network uncovered it. Throckmorton was tortured and executed. The Spanish ambassador was expelled from England.</p>
              <p><strong>The Babington Plot (1586):</strong> The most serious plot. Anthony Babington planned to assassinate Elizabeth, free Mary, and trigger a Catholic uprising backed by Spain. Walsingham intercepted coded letters showing <strong>Mary approved the assassination</strong>. This gave the evidence to put Mary on trial. Babington and his co-conspirators were executed.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h4>How Serious Was the Catholic Threat?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Serious because:</strong> The plots had foreign backing (Spain, the Pope), involved assassination plans, and could have triggered invasion. Seminary priests and Jesuits kept Catholicism alive in England from the 1570s.</li>
          <li><strong>Less serious because:</strong> Most English Catholics were loyal and did not support violence. The plots were poorly organised and Walsingham&rsquo;s spy network caught every one. The plotters never had enough support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Mary, Queen of Scots</h3>

        <p>Mary Stuart was Elizabeth&rsquo;s Catholic cousin with a strong claim to the English throne. After being forced to abdicate in Scotland, she fled to England in <strong>1568</strong> and was kept under house arrest for <strong>19 years</strong>. She became the focal point of every Catholic plot against Elizabeth.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Mary&rsquo;s Execution</div>
          <p>After the Babington Plot proved Mary supported assassination plans, she was tried, found guilty, and <strong>executed on 8 February 1587</strong> at Fotheringhay Castle. Elizabeth hesitated for months, knowing it set a dangerous precedent and would likely provoke Spain.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>How Serious Was the Threat from Mary?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Serious because:</strong> Mary had a legitimate claim to the throne and was the figurehead of every major Catholic plot. As long as she lived, Catholic conspirators had someone to rally around.</li>
          <li><strong>Less serious because:</strong> Mary was a prisoner with no army, no resources, and no freedom. She relied on others who repeatedly failed. Her execution in 1587 ended the threat.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Spain</h3>

        <p>Spain under <strong>Philip II</strong> was the most powerful country in Europe, with vast wealth from its American empire and the strongest military. Philip saw himself as the defender of the Catholic faith.</p>

        <h4>How Serious Was the Spanish Threat?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Serious because:</strong> Spain had the resources to mount a real invasion. The 1588 Armada was the largest naval force ever assembled at that time. Spain backed Catholic plots and could have combined invasion with internal rebellion. Two further armadas were sent in 1596 and 1597.</li>
          <li><strong>Less serious because:</strong> The Armada failed due to English tactics, better ships, and storms. Spain was also fighting in the Netherlands and could not focus fully on England. The later armadas were destroyed by weather. Spain never landed troops on English soil.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. The Puritan Challenge</h3>

        <p>Puritans were extreme Protestants who believed the 1559 Religious Settlement did not go far enough. They wanted simpler services, no vestments, no bishops, and a &lsquo;purer&rsquo; form of worship.</p>

        <h4>How Serious Was the Puritan Threat?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Serious because:</strong> Puritans challenged Elizabeth&rsquo;s authority as Supreme Governor. Some Puritan MPs tried to push reforms through Parliament. The &lsquo;Marprelate Tracts&rsquo; (1588&ndash;89) openly mocked bishops. Puritans had support among powerful figures.</li>
          <li><strong>Less serious because:</strong> Puritans never threatened Elizabeth&rsquo;s life or plotted to overthrow her &mdash; they wanted to <strong>reform the Church</strong>, not remove the Queen. They had no foreign backing or military power. Archbishop Whitgift suppressed organised opposition by the 1590s.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. The Succession Crisis</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth never married and never named an heir. If she died suddenly, there was no clear successor &mdash; risking <strong>civil war</strong>, foreign intervention, or the collapse of the Protestant settlement.</p>

        <h4>How Serious Was the Succession Threat?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Serious because:</strong> Without a clear heir, Elizabeth&rsquo;s death could have caused chaos. Parliament repeatedly pressed her to marry or name a successor. The uncertainty encouraged Catholic plots, since Mary was a possible alternative. It also gave Spain an opening.</li>
          <li><strong>Less serious because:</strong> Elizabeth survived until 1603. Robert Cecil secretly arranged the smooth succession of <strong>James VI of Scotland</strong> (James I of England). The peaceful transition suggests the threat never became a real crisis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Which Threat Was the Most Dangerous?</h3>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Making a Judgement</div>
          <p>There is no single right answer &mdash; what matters is <strong>justifying your argument with evidence</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mary, Queen of Scots</strong> connected all the Catholic threats. Without her, plotters had no realistic candidate to replace Elizabeth.</li>
            <li><strong>Spain</strong> was the only threat with the military power to invade. If the Armada had succeeded, it would have been catastrophic.</li>
            <li><strong>The combination</strong> was what made it truly dangerous. Mary + Catholic plots + Spanish military power + the succession crisis created a web of linked threats.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>How Elizabeth Dealt with the Threats</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Walsingham&rsquo;s spy network:</strong> His intelligence service infiltrated Catholic networks, intercepted letters, and uncovered plots before they could succeed.</li>
          <li><strong>Harsh anti-Catholic laws:</strong> From the 1580s, it was treason to be a Catholic priest in England. Recusancy fines rose. Seminary priests and Jesuits were hunted and often executed.</li>
          <li><strong>Mary&rsquo;s execution (1587):</strong> Removed the figurehead of Catholic opposition, though it provoked Spain.</li>
          <li><strong>Military investment:</strong> Spending on the navy paid off with the Armada&rsquo;s defeat in 1588.</li>
          <li><strong>The Religious Settlement:</strong> The &lsquo;middle way&rsquo; satisfied most people, isolating Catholic and Puritan extremists.</li>
          <li><strong>Control of Parliament:</strong> Elizabeth used her prerogative to block Parliament on marriage, succession, and religious reform.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Exam Tip -->
      <div class="exam-tip">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Threat questions ask you to <strong>evaluate</strong> or <strong>compare</strong>. (1) Explain each threat with specific evidence (names, dates, events). (2) Assess how serious it was &mdash; what could have happened if it succeeded? (3) Show how threats were <strong>interconnected</strong> (Mary linked to Catholic plots, which were backed by Spain). (4) Reach a clear <strong>judgement</strong> about which was most dangerous. The best answers argue, not just describe.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Elizabeth faced threats from Catholic plots, Mary Queen of Scots, Spain, Puritans, and the succession crisis. The most dangerous were those that combined together &mdash; Mary as figurehead, Catholic conspiracies, and Spanish military power. She survived through shrewd judgement, Walsingham&rsquo;s spies, military investment, and some good fortune.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Threats were interconnected:</strong> Catholic plots, Mary, and Spain were closely linked &mdash; together they were far more dangerous than alone.</li>
          <li><strong>Walsingham&rsquo;s spy network was crucial:</strong> He uncovered every major Catholic plot before it could succeed.</li>
          <li><strong>Elizabeth managed threats skilfully:</strong> Diplomacy, the Religious Settlement, naval strength, and careful use of power kept her on the throne for 45 years.</li>
        </ul>
