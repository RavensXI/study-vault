        <h2>Catholic Plots Against Elizabeth</h2>

        <p>Throughout the 1570s and 1580s, Elizabeth faced a series of Catholic conspiracies that aimed to assassinate her, free Mary, Queen of Scots, and restore Catholicism to England. These plots were encouraged by the <strong>papal bull of 1570</strong> and supported by foreign Catholic powers, especially Spain. Understanding each plot &mdash; and how the government responded &mdash; is a key part of the AQA specification.</p>

        <h3>The Papal Bull of 1570 (<em>Regnans in Excelsis</em>)</h3>

        <p>In <strong>February 1570</strong>, Pope Pius V issued a papal bull (an official order) called <em>Regnans in Excelsis</em>. This <strong>excommunicated</strong> Elizabeth, meaning she was expelled from the Catholic Church. More dangerously, it declared that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Elizabeth was a <strong>heretic</strong> (someone who goes against the true faith) and an illegitimate ruler</li>
          <li>English Catholics were <strong>released from their duty to obey</strong> her</li>
          <li>It was not a sin to plot against Elizabeth or even to <strong>kill her</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why the Papal Bull Mattered</div>
          <p>The papal bull was a turning point. Before 1570, most English Catholics were loyal to Elizabeth &mdash; they simply wanted to worship in their own way. After the bull, every Catholic was potentially a traitor in the eyes of the government, because the Pope had told them they did not have to obey the queen. This made the government far more suspicious and led to harsher laws against Catholics.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Ridolfi Plot, 1571</h3>

        <p><strong>Roberto Ridolfi</strong> was an Italian banker living in London who acted as an agent for the Pope. His plan was to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Assassinate Elizabeth</li>
          <li>Replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots</li>
          <li>Have Mary marry the <strong>Duke of Norfolk</strong>, England&rsquo;s leading Catholic nobleman</li>
          <li>Bring in a Spanish invasion force of <strong>6,000 troops</strong> led by the Duke of Alba from the Spanish Netherlands</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The plot was uncovered by <strong>William Cecil</strong> and his agents, who intercepted coded letters. The Duke of Norfolk was arrested, tried for treason, and <strong>executed in June 1572</strong>. Ridolfi himself escaped abroad. Mary was implicated but Elizabeth refused to act against her.</p>

        <h3>The Throckmorton Plot, 1583</h3>

        <p>By the 1580s, <strong>Sir Francis Walsingham</strong> had built up an extensive spy network to protect Elizabeth. His agents uncovered a plot led by <strong>Francis Throckmorton</strong>, a young Catholic nobleman.</p>

        <p>The plan involved:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A French Catholic invasion of England, backed by Spain and the Pope</li>
          <li>The freeing of Mary, Queen of Scots</li>
          <li>The overthrow of Elizabeth and restoration of Catholicism</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Walsingham&rsquo;s spies tracked Throckmorton for months. When he was arrested in <strong>November 1583</strong>, they found lists of Catholic sympathisers and details of safe harbours for an invasion fleet. Under torture, Throckmorton confessed. He was <strong>executed in 1584</strong>. The Spanish ambassador, <strong>Bernardino de Mendoza</strong>, was expelled from England for his involvement.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Walsingham&rsquo;s Spy Network</div>
          <p>Sir Francis Walsingham employed a network of over <strong>50 agents and informers</strong> across England and Europe. His methods included intercepting letters, using code-breakers, placing spies in Catholic households, and even using <strong>double agents</strong> who pretended to support plots while really reporting to the government. Walsingham&rsquo;s intelligence work was crucial in uncovering Catholic conspiracies.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Babington Plot, 1586</h3>

        <p>The Babington Plot was the most significant conspiracy and the one that finally sealed Mary&rsquo;s fate. <strong>Anthony Babington</strong>, a young Catholic gentleman, organised a plot to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Assassinate Elizabeth</li>
          <li>Free Mary from prison</li>
          <li>Launch a Catholic invasion supported by Spain</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Walsingham knew about the plot from the very beginning. He used a <strong>double agent</strong> called Gilbert Gifford to smuggle letters between Mary and Babington &mdash; hidden inside <strong>beer barrels</strong>. Walsingham&rsquo;s code-breaker, <strong>Thomas Phelippes</strong>, deciphered every letter.</p>

        <p>Crucially, Mary wrote a letter in <strong>July 1586</strong> that appeared to give her <strong>approval for Elizabeth&rsquo;s assassination</strong>. This was the evidence Walsingham had been waiting for. Babington and his fellow conspirators were arrested and <strong>executed in September 1586</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Mary&rsquo;s Trial and Execution, 1587</h3>

        <p>Mary was put on trial at <strong>Fotheringhay Castle</strong> in October 1586. She denied the charges, arguing that as an anointed queen she could not be tried by an English court. Nevertheless, she was found <strong>guilty of treason</strong>.</p>

        <p>Parliament and the Privy Council urged Elizabeth to sign the death warrant. Elizabeth hesitated for months &mdash; she was deeply reluctant to execute a fellow monarch and cousin. Eventually, she signed the warrant in <strong>February 1587</strong>.</p>

        <p>Mary was <strong>executed on 8 February 1587</strong> at Fotheringhay Castle. Elizabeth reportedly claimed she had not intended the warrant to be carried out so quickly and blamed her secretary, <strong>William Davison</strong>, who was briefly imprisoned.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Consequences of Mary&rsquo;s Execution</div>
          <ul>
            <li>The immediate Catholic figurehead threat was removed</li>
            <li><strong>Philip II of Spain</strong> used Mary&rsquo;s execution as justification for launching the Spanish Armada in 1588</li>
            <li>Relations with France and Scotland were strained but did not lead to war</li>
            <li>Elizabeth was genuinely distressed, as she feared the precedent of executing a queen</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Government&rsquo;s Response to the Catholic Threat</h3>

        <p>Each plot led to harsher measures against Catholics in England:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>1571:</strong> Treasons Act made it illegal to say Elizabeth was not the rightful queen</li>
          <li><strong>1581:</strong> Fines for recusancy (not attending Church of England services) were increased to <strong>&pound;20 per month</strong> &mdash; a huge sum</li>
          <li><strong>1581:</strong> It became treason to convert anyone to Catholicism</li>
          <li><strong>1585:</strong> It became treason simply to be a Catholic priest in England; anyone sheltering a priest faced the death penalty</li>
          <li><strong>Seminary priests</strong> and <strong>Jesuit missionaries</strong> were hunted down; around <strong>130 priests</strong> were executed during Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Exam Tip -->
      <div class="exam-tip">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When comparing the plots, look for <strong>patterns</strong>: each involved Mary as the replacement queen, each had foreign backing, and each was uncovered by Elizabeth&rsquo;s increasingly effective intelligence network. Examiners reward answers that show how the plots <strong>escalated over time</strong> and how the government&rsquo;s response became progressively harsher. Always link the papal bull of 1570 to the increasing threat.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Catholic plots against Elizabeth were a persistent and serious threat throughout the 1570s and 1580s. Encouraged by the papal bull of 1570 and supported by foreign Catholic powers, conspirators repeatedly attempted to replace Elizabeth with Mary, Queen of Scots. It was only through Walsingham&rsquo;s spy network and increasingly harsh anti-Catholic legislation that the threat was eventually contained &mdash; culminating in Mary&rsquo;s execution in 1587.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The papal bull of 1570</strong> was a turning point that made all Catholics potential traitors and encouraged plots against Elizabeth.</li>
          <li><strong>Three major plots</strong> &mdash; Ridolfi (1571), Throckmorton (1583), and Babington (1586) &mdash; all aimed to replace Elizabeth with Mary and restore Catholicism.</li>
          <li><strong>Walsingham&rsquo;s spy network</strong> was crucial in uncovering each plot, using methods like intercepting letters, code-breaking, and double agents.</li>
          <li><strong>Mary&rsquo;s execution (1587)</strong> removed the Catholic figurehead but contributed directly to the Spanish Armada of 1588.</li>
        </ul>
