        <h2>Catholic Plots Against Elizabeth</h2>

        <p>Throughout the 1570s and 1580s, Elizabeth faced a series of Catholic plots to assassinate her, free Mary, Queen of Scots, and restore Catholicism. These were encouraged by the <strong>papal bull of 1570</strong> and backed by foreign Catholic powers, especially Spain.</p>

        <h3>The Papal Bull of 1570 (<em>Regnans in Excelsis</em>)</h3>

        <p>In <strong>1570</strong>, Pope Pius V issued a <dfn class="term" data-def="An official statement or order from the Pope, the head of the Catholic Church.">papal bull</dfn> called <em>Regnans in Excelsis</em>. The Pope had hoped the Northern Rebellion would succeed &mdash; when it failed, he responded by <strong>excommunicating</strong> Elizabeth. The bull declared that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Elizabeth was a <dfn class="term" data-def="A person whose beliefs go against the official teachings of the Church.">heretic</dfn> and an illegitimate ruler</li>
          <li>English Catholics were <strong>released from their duty to obey</strong> her</li>
          <li>It was not a sin to plot against Elizabeth or even to <strong>kill her</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>This was a signal to the world that the Pope supported Elizabeth&rsquo;s overthrow. It would encourage English Catholics to rebel &mdash; and encourage foreign kings to attack.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why the Papal Bull Mattered</div>
          <p>Before 1570, most English Catholics were loyal to Elizabeth &mdash; they simply wanted to worship in their own way. After the bull, every Catholic was potentially a traitor in the government&rsquo;s eyes. Catholics now had to choose between their queen and their God. This led to far harsher laws.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Catholic Missionaries and the Jesuit Threat</h3>

        <p>In <strong>1568</strong>, the Catholic Church set up a training college at <strong>Douai</strong> in the Netherlands. It was run by the <dfn class="term" data-def="A strict Catholic religious order founded in 1540, dedicated to spreading Catholicism and countering Protestantism.">Jesuits</dfn>, a strict and devoted branch of the Catholic Church. They trained priests to be smuggled into England to spread the Catholic faith.</p>

        <p>These Jesuit priests secretly stayed in the homes of wealthy Catholic families. They held hidden Catholic services. Many country houses built secret hiding places called <strong>priest holes</strong> &mdash; if local officials arrived on a tip-off, the priest and his religious items could be stashed away.</p>

        <p>There was a growing number of <dfn class="term" data-def="People who refused to attend Church of England services, as required by law. Most were Catholics.">recusants</dfn> &mdash; people who refused to attend Church of England services. This was a direct challenge to Elizabeth&rsquo;s authority. She responded with ever-stricter laws and the use of spies.</p>

        <h3>The Ridolfi Plot, 1571</h3>

        <p><strong>Roberto Ridolfi</strong> was an Italian banker in London who acted as an agent for the Pope. His plan was to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Assassinate Elizabeth</li>
          <li>Replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots</li>
          <li>Have Mary marry the <strong>Duke of Norfolk</strong></li>
          <li>Bring in a Spanish invasion of <strong>6,000 troops</strong> led by the Duke of Alba from the Netherlands</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>William Cecil</strong> and his agents intercepted coded letters and uncovered the plot. Norfolk was tried for treason and <strong>executed in June 1572</strong>. Ridolfi escaped abroad. Mary was implicated, but Elizabeth refused to act against her.</p>

        <h3>The Throckmorton Plot, 1583</h3>

        <p>By the 1580s, <strong>Sir Francis Walsingham</strong> had built a powerful spy network. His agents uncovered a plot led by <strong>Francis Throckmorton</strong>, a young Catholic nobleman. The plan involved:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A French Catholic invasion, backed by Spain and the Pope</li>
          <li>Freeing Mary, Queen of Scots</li>
          <li>Overthrowing Elizabeth and restoring Catholicism</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Walsingham&rsquo;s spies tracked Throckmorton for months. When arrested in <strong>November 1583</strong>, he was found with lists of Catholic sympathisers and details of safe harbours for an invasion fleet. Under torture, he confessed and was <strong>executed in 1584</strong>. The Spanish ambassador, <strong>Bernardino de Mendoza</strong>, was expelled from England.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Walsingham&rsquo;s Spy Network</div>
          <p>Walsingham employed over <strong>50 agents and informers</strong> across England and Europe. He intercepted letters, used code-breakers, placed spies in Catholic households, and ran <strong>double agents</strong> who pretended to support plots while reporting to the government. Few plots got beyond the planning stage thanks to his network.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Babington Plot, 1586</h3>

        <p>The Babington Plot was the most important conspiracy &mdash; and the one that finally sealed Mary&rsquo;s fate. <strong>Anthony Babington</strong>, a young Catholic gentleman, plotted to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Assassinate Elizabeth</li>
          <li>Free Mary from prison</li>
          <li>Launch a Catholic invasion backed by Spain</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Walsingham knew about the plot from the start. He used a double agent called <strong>Gilbert Gifford</strong> to smuggle letters between Mary and Babington &mdash; hidden inside <strong>beer barrels</strong>. Mary wrote her replies using a secret <dfn class="term" data-def="A system of symbols or letters used to write messages in code so they cannot be read if intercepted.">cipher</dfn>, but Walsingham&rsquo;s code-breaker, <strong>Thomas Phelippes</strong>, cracked every letter.</p>

        <p>In <strong>July 1586</strong>, Mary wrote a letter that appeared to <strong>approve Elizabeth&rsquo;s assassination</strong>. This was the proof Walsingham had been waiting for. Babington and his conspirators were arrested and <strong>executed in September 1586</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Mary&rsquo;s Trial and Execution, 1587</h3>

        <p>Mary was tried at <strong>Fotheringhay Castle</strong> in October 1586. She denied the charges, arguing that as an anointed queen she could not be tried by an English court. She was found <strong>guilty of treason</strong>.</p>

        <p>Parliament and the Privy Council urged Elizabeth to sign the death warrant. Elizabeth hesitated for months &mdash; she feared the precedent of executing a fellow monarch. She eventually signed, and Mary was <strong>executed on 8 February 1587</strong>. Elizabeth claimed she had not intended the warrant to be carried out so quickly and blamed her secretary, <strong>William Davison</strong>, who was briefly imprisoned.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Consequences of Mary&rsquo;s Execution</div>
          <ul>
            <li>The Catholic figurehead threat was removed &mdash; there was no longer an obvious Catholic replacement for Elizabeth</li>
            <li>Mary became a <strong>Catholic martyr</strong> &mdash; seen as a victim of Protestant persecution</li>
            <li><strong>Philip II of Spain</strong> used the execution to justify launching the <strong>Spanish Armada</strong> in 1588</li>
            <li>The succession problem was partly solved: Mary&rsquo;s son <strong>James VI of Scotland</strong> was Protestant and became the likely heir</li>
            <li>Relations with France and Scotland were strained but did not lead to war</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Government&rsquo;s Response to the Catholic Threat</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth had started out being fairly soft on Catholics &mdash; she said she did not want to make &ldquo;windows into men&rsquo;s souls.&rdquo; But as threats grew, the laws became much harsher:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>1571:</strong> Recusancy fines introduced for Catholics who did not attend Protestant services. It became illegal to own Catholic items such as rosary beads. Elizabeth actually resisted when Parliament tried to make the fines harsher.</li>
          <li><strong>1581:</strong> Fines increased to <strong>&pound;20 per month</strong> &mdash; more than most could afford. It became <strong>high treason</strong> to convert anyone to Catholicism, punishable by death.</li>
          <li><strong>1585:</strong> Any Catholic priest ordained after 1559 was considered a traitor. Anyone sheltering a priest faced death. It also became legal to kill anyone who attempted to assassinate the queen.</li>
          <li><strong>1593:</strong> The <strong>&ldquo;Statute of Confinement&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; Catholics could not travel more than <strong>five miles</strong> from their home without permission.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Around <strong>130 priests</strong> were executed during Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign as seminary priests and Jesuit missionaries were hunted down.</p>

        </figure>

        <h3>Why Did the Plots Fail?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Walsingham&rsquo;s spies:</strong> Few plots got beyond the planning stage thanks to his intelligence network.</li>
          <li><strong>Religious tolerance:</strong> Elizabeth&rsquo;s settlement meant most Catholics were content to worship in secret. In strongly Catholic areas, laws were often not strictly enforced.</li>
          <li><strong>Skilled leadership:</strong> Elizabeth allowed Parliament and lords to debate, but she used her power and influence well.</li>
          <li><strong>Harsh punishments:</strong> Traitors were dealt with swiftly. Executions were public and brutal, deterring others.</li>
          <li><strong>No convincing alternative:</strong> Most English people wanted an English ruler, not a foreigner like Philip of Spain. Mary was suspected of murder.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Exam Tip -->
      <div class="exam-tip">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Look for <strong>patterns</strong> across the plots: each involved Mary as the replacement, each had foreign backing, and each was uncovered by Elizabeth&rsquo;s spy network. Show how the plots <strong>escalated over time</strong> and how the government&rsquo;s response got harsher. Always link back to the papal bull of 1570 as the turning point.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Catholic plots were a serious and persistent threat. Encouraged by the papal bull and backed by foreign powers, conspirators repeatedly tried to replace Elizabeth with Mary. Walsingham&rsquo;s spies and ever-harsher laws contained the danger &mdash; until Mary&rsquo;s execution in 1587 removed the figurehead for good.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The papal bull (1570)</strong> was the turning point &mdash; it made all Catholics potential traitors and encouraged plots. Jesuit missionaries smuggled into England added to the threat.</li>
          <li><strong>Three major plots</strong> &mdash; Ridolfi (1571), Throckmorton (1583), Babington (1586) &mdash; all aimed to replace Elizabeth with Mary. Each was uncovered by Walsingham&rsquo;s spy network.</li>
          <li><strong>Mary&rsquo;s execution (1587)</strong> removed the Catholic figurehead but made her a martyr and gave Philip II his excuse for the Spanish Armada.</li>
        </ul>
