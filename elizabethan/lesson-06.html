        <h2>Catholic Plots Against Elizabeth</h2>

        <p>Throughout the 1570s and 1580s, Elizabeth faced a series of Catholic plots to assassinate her, free Mary, Queen of Scots, and restore Catholicism. These were encouraged by the <strong>papal bull of 1570</strong> and backed by foreign Catholic powers, especially Spain.</p>

        <h3>The Papal Bull of 1570 (<em>Regnans in Excelsis</em>)</h3>

        <p>In <strong>1570</strong>, Pope Pius V issued a <dfn class="term" data-def="An official statement or order from the Pope, the head of the Catholic Church.">papal bull</dfn> called <em>Regnans in Excelsis</em>. The Pope had hoped the Northern Rebellion would succeed &mdash; when it failed, he responded by <strong>excommunicating</strong> Elizabeth. The bull declared that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Elizabeth was a <dfn class="term" data-def="A person whose beliefs go against the official teachings of the Church.">heretic</dfn> and an illegitimate ruler</li>
          <li>English Catholics were <strong>released from their duty to obey</strong> her</li>
          <li>It was not a sin to plot against Elizabeth or even to <strong>kill her</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>This was a signal to the world that the Pope supported Elizabeth&rsquo;s overthrow. It would encourage English Catholics to rebel &mdash; and encourage foreign kings to attack.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why the Papal Bull Mattered</div>
          <p>Before 1570, most English Catholics were loyal to Elizabeth &mdash; they simply wanted to worship in their own way. After the bull, every Catholic was potentially a traitor in the government&rsquo;s eyes. Catholics now had to choose between their queen and their God. This led to far harsher laws.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Catholic Missionaries and the Jesuit Threat</h3>

        <p>In <strong>1568</strong>, the Catholic Church set up a training college at <strong>Douai</strong> in the Netherlands. It was run by the <dfn class="term" data-def="A strict Catholic religious order founded in 1540, dedicated to spreading Catholicism and countering Protestantism.">Jesuits</dfn>, a strict and devoted branch of the Catholic Church. They trained priests to be smuggled into England to spread the Catholic faith.</p>

        <p>These Jesuit priests secretly stayed in the homes of wealthy Catholic families. They held hidden Catholic services. Many country houses built secret hiding places called <strong>priest holes</strong> &mdash; if local officials arrived on a tip-off, the priest and his religious items could be stashed away.</p>

        <p>There was a growing number of <dfn class="term" data-def="People who refused to attend Church of England services, as required by law. Most were Catholics.">recusants</dfn> &mdash; people who refused to attend Church of England services. This was a direct challenge to Elizabeth&rsquo;s authority. She responded with ever-stricter laws and the use of spies.</p>

        <h3>The Ridolfi Plot, 1571</h3>

        <p><strong>Roberto Ridolfi</strong> was an Italian banker in London who acted as an agent for the Pope. His plan was to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Assassinate Elizabeth</li>
          <li>Replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots</li>
          <li>Have Mary marry the <strong>Duke of Norfolk</strong></li>
          <li>Bring in a Spanish invasion of <strong>6,000 troops</strong> led by the Duke of Alba from the Netherlands</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>William Cecil</strong> and his agents intercepted coded letters and uncovered the plot. Norfolk was tried for treason and <strong>executed in June 1572</strong>. Ridolfi escaped abroad. Mary was implicated, but Elizabeth refused to act against her.</p>

        <h3>The Throckmorton Plot, 1583</h3>

        <p>By the 1580s, <strong>Sir Francis Walsingham</strong> had built a powerful spy network. His agents uncovered a plot led by <strong>Francis Throckmorton</strong>, a young Catholic nobleman. The plan involved:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A French Catholic invasion, backed by Spain and the Pope</li>
          <li>Freeing Mary, Queen of Scots</li>
          <li>Overthrowing Elizabeth and restoring Catholicism</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Walsingham&rsquo;s spies tracked Throckmorton for months. When arrested in <strong>November 1583</strong>, he was found with lists of Catholic sympathisers and details of safe harbours for an invasion fleet. Under torture, he confessed and was <strong>executed in 1584</strong>. The Spanish ambassador, <strong>Bernardino de Mendoza</strong>, was expelled from England.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Walsingham&rsquo;s Spy Network</div>
          <p>Walsingham employed over <strong>50 agents and informers</strong> across England and Europe. He intercepted letters, used code-breakers, placed spies in Catholic households, and ran <strong>double agents</strong> who pretended to support plots while reporting to the government. Few plots got beyond the planning stage thanks to his network.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Babington Plot, 1586</h3>

        <p>The Babington Plot was the most important conspiracy &mdash; and the one that finally sealed Mary&rsquo;s fate. <strong>Anthony Babington</strong>, a young Catholic gentleman, plotted to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Assassinate Elizabeth</li>
          <li>Free Mary from prison</li>
          <li>Launch a Catholic invasion backed by Spain</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Walsingham knew about the plot from the start. He used a double agent called <strong>Gilbert Gifford</strong> to smuggle letters between Mary and Babington &mdash; hidden inside <strong>beer barrels</strong>. Mary wrote her replies using a secret <dfn class="term" data-def="A system of symbols or letters used to write messages in code so they cannot be read if intercepted.">cipher</dfn>, but Walsingham&rsquo;s code-breaker, <strong>Thomas Phelippes</strong>, cracked every letter.</p>

        <p>In <strong>July 1586</strong>, Mary wrote a letter that appeared to <strong>approve Elizabeth&rsquo;s assassination</strong>. This was the proof Walsingham had been waiting for. Babington and his conspirators were arrested and <strong>executed in September 1586</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Mary&rsquo;s Trial and Execution, 1587</h3>

        <p>Mary was tried at <strong>Fotheringhay Castle</strong> in October 1586. She denied the charges, arguing that as an anointed queen she could not be tried by an English court. She was found <strong>guilty of treason</strong>.</p>

        <p>Parliament and the Privy Council urged Elizabeth to sign the death warrant. Elizabeth hesitated for months &mdash; she feared the precedent of executing a fellow monarch. She eventually signed, and Mary was <strong>executed on 8 February 1587</strong>. Elizabeth claimed she had not intended the warrant to be carried out so quickly and blamed her secretary, <strong>William Davison</strong>, who was briefly imprisoned.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Consequences of Mary&rsquo;s Execution</div>
          <ul>
            <li>The Catholic figurehead threat was removed &mdash; there was no longer an obvious Catholic replacement for Elizabeth</li>
            <li>Mary became a <strong>Catholic martyr</strong> &mdash; seen as a victim of Protestant persecution</li>
            <li><strong>Philip II of Spain</strong> used the execution to justify launching the <strong>Spanish Armada</strong> in 1588</li>
            <li>The succession problem was partly solved: Mary&rsquo;s son <strong>James VI of Scotland</strong> was Protestant and became the likely heir</li>
            <li>Relations with France and Scotland were strained but did not lead to war</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Government&rsquo;s Response to the Catholic Threat</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth had started out being fairly soft on Catholics &mdash; she said she did not want to make &ldquo;windows into men&rsquo;s souls.&rdquo; But as threats grew, the laws became much harsher:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>1571:</strong> Recusancy fines introduced for Catholics who did not attend Protestant services. It became illegal to own Catholic items such as rosary beads. Elizabeth actually resisted when Parliament tried to make the fines harsher.</li>
          <li><strong>1581:</strong> Fines increased to <strong>&pound;20 per month</strong> &mdash; more than most could afford. It became <strong>high treason</strong> to convert anyone to Catholicism, punishable by death.</li>
          <li><strong>1585:</strong> Any Catholic priest ordained after 1559 was considered a traitor. Anyone sheltering a priest faced death. It also became legal to kill anyone who attempted to assassinate the queen.</li>
          <li><strong>1593:</strong> The <strong>&ldquo;Statute of Confinement&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; Catholics could not travel more than <strong>five miles</strong> from their home without permission.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Around <strong>130 priests</strong> were executed during Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign as seminary priests and Jesuit missionaries were hunted down.</p>

        </figure>

        <h3>Why Did the Plots Fail?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Walsingham&rsquo;s spies:</strong> Few plots got beyond the planning stage thanks to his intelligence network.</li>
          <li><strong>Religious tolerance:</strong> Elizabeth&rsquo;s settlement meant most Catholics were content to worship in secret. In strongly Catholic areas, laws were often not strictly enforced.</li>
          <li><strong>Skilled leadership:</strong> Elizabeth allowed Parliament and lords to debate, but she used her power and influence well.</li>
          <li><strong>Harsh punishments:</strong> Traitors were dealt with swiftly. Executions were public and brutal, deterring others.</li>
          <li><strong>No convincing alternative:</strong> Most English people wanted an English ruler, not a foreigner like Philip of Spain. Mary was suspected of murder.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Exam Tip -->
      <div class="exam-tip">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Look for <strong>patterns</strong> across the plots: each involved Mary as the replacement, each had foreign backing, and each was uncovered by Elizabeth&rsquo;s spy network. Show how the plots <strong>escalated over time</strong> and how the government&rsquo;s response got harsher. Always link back to the papal bull of 1570 as the turning point.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Catholic plots were a serious and persistent threat. Encouraged by the papal bull and backed by foreign powers, conspirators repeatedly tried to replace Elizabeth with Mary. Walsingham&rsquo;s spies and ever-harsher laws contained the danger &mdash; until Mary&rsquo;s execution in 1587 removed the figurehead for good.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The papal bull (1570)</strong> was the turning point &mdash; it made all Catholics potential traitors and encouraged plots. Jesuit missionaries smuggled into England added to the threat.</li>
          <li><strong>Three major plots</strong> &mdash; Ridolfi (1571), Throckmorton (1583), Babington (1586) &mdash; all aimed to replace Elizabeth with Mary. Each was uncovered by Walsingham&rsquo;s spy network.</li>
          <li><strong>Mary&rsquo;s execution (1587)</strong> removed the Catholic figurehead but made her a martyr and gave Philip II his excuse for the Spanish Armada.</li>
        </ul>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: A complex account might trace the escalation from the papal bull of 1570 (which released Catholics from obedience to Elizabeth and encouraged plots) through the Ridolfi Plot (1571), Throckmorton Plot (1583), and Babington Plot (1586), showing how each plot built on the last and how Walsingham\u2019s spy network became increasingly sophisticated in response. The answer might link the plots to foreign powers (Spain, the Pope) and show how the threat led to harsher anti-Catholic laws and ultimately Mary\u2019s execution in 1587.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: A developed account might explain the Ridolfi Plot (involving Norfolk and a Spanish invasion of 6,000 troops) and the Babington Plot (where Walsingham used Gilbert Gifford to smuggle letters in beer barrels and Thomas Phelippes cracked Mary\u2019s cipher), showing how both aimed to assassinate Elizabeth, free Mary, and restore Catholicism.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: A simple account might describe one plot, such as the Babington Plot, noting that Babington planned to kill Elizabeth and free Mary, and that Walsingham uncovered it.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: Catholics wanted to kill Elizabeth and put Mary on the throne.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain that before 1570 most English Catholics were loyal to Elizabeth, but the papal bull released them from obedience and declared it was not a sin to plot against her. This transformed the Catholic threat \u2014 every Catholic became a potential traitor in the government\u2019s eyes. The bull encouraged foreign-backed plots (Ridolfi 1571, Throckmorton 1583, Babington 1586) and led to harsher laws, including \u00a320/month recusancy fines (1581) and the death penalty for harbouring priests (1585). It also encouraged Jesuit missionaries from Douai to infiltrate England.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: A developed answer might explain that the bull declared Elizabeth a heretic and encouraged Catholics to rebel, then show how this led to stricter laws such as the 1581 fine of \u00a320/month and the 1585 law making it treason to be a Catholic priest ordained after 1559.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The bull was important because the Pope said Catholics did not have to obey Elizabeth, which encouraged plots against her.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The Pope excommunicated Elizabeth and this caused problems.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: A complex account might trace the escalation of the government\u2019s response: Elizabeth initially said she did not want to make \u2018windows into men\u2019s souls,\u2019 but after the papal bull (1570) laws hardened. Recusancy fines were introduced (1571), then raised to \u00a320/month (1581). By 1585, any priest ordained after 1559 was a traitor, and sheltering a priest meant death. Walsingham built a spy network of over 50 agents, used code-breakers like Thomas Phelippes, and ran double agents like Gilbert Gifford. Around 130 priests were executed. The Statute of Confinement (1593) restricted Catholic travel to five miles from home.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: A developed account might cover two stages: the early, softer approach (fines and attendance laws) and the later, harsher response (death penalty for priests, Walsingham\u2019s spies uncovering plots like Throckmorton and Babington).\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: A simple account might describe the recusancy fines and Walsingham\u2019s role in catching plotters.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: Elizabeth passed laws against Catholics and used spies.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain that the Babington Plot was the most important Catholic conspiracy because it directly led to Mary\u2019s execution. Walsingham used Gilbert Gifford to smuggle letters in beer barrels and Thomas Phelippes cracked Mary\u2019s cipher. When Mary wrote approving Elizabeth\u2019s assassination (July 1586), Walsingham had the proof he needed. Babington was executed in September 1586, and Mary was tried at Fotheringhay Castle and executed on 8 February 1587. This removed the Catholic figurehead but made Mary a martyr, and Philip II used it to justify the Spanish Armada in 1588.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: A developed answer might explain that Walsingham trapped Mary using intercepted letters, leading to her trial and execution, and that this had consequences including removing the Catholic claimant and provoking Spain.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The Babington Plot was important because it gave Elizabeth the evidence to execute Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The Babington Plot led to Mary being killed.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: A complex account might explain that Mary was tried at Fotheringhay Castle in October 1586 after the Babington Plot proved she had approved Elizabeth\u2019s assassination. Mary denied the charges, arguing an anointed queen could not be tried by an English court. She was found guilty. Elizabeth hesitated for months before signing the death warrant, then blamed her secretary William Davison. Mary was executed on 8 February 1587. The consequences were far-reaching: the Catholic figurehead was removed, Mary became a Catholic martyr, Philip II used the execution to justify the Armada (1588), and the succession was partly resolved as Mary\u2019s Protestant son James VI became the likely heir.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: A developed account might describe the trial and execution, then explain at least two consequences such as removing the Catholic figurehead and provoking Spain.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: A simple account might describe the execution and note it angered Spain.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: Mary was executed and this caused problems with Spain.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain that Walsingham employed over 50 agents and informers across England and Europe, intercepted coded letters, used code-breakers, and ran double agents in Catholic households. His network uncovered the Throckmorton Plot (1583) \u2014 where agents tracked Throckmorton for months and found lists of Catholic sympathisers and invasion harbour details \u2014 and engineered the Babington Plot trap (1586) using Gilbert Gifford. Few Catholic plots got beyond the planning stage. This was important because it allowed Elizabeth to act against plotters with evidence (leading to executions and the expulsion of the Spanish ambassador Mendoza), and ultimately provided the proof needed to execute Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: A developed answer might explain that Walsingham\u2019s spies uncovered both the Throckmorton and Babington plots, and that his code-breaker Thomas Phelippes cracked Mary\u2019s cipher, providing the evidence for her trial.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Walsingham\u2019s spies were important because they caught Catholic plotters like Babington before they could act.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance.
