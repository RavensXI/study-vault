        <h2>How Elizabeth Ruled England</h2>

        <h3>Tudor Society</h3>

        <p>Society under the Tudors was very structured. It was possible to move between groups, but rare and difficult. Respect for those above you was expected at all times &mdash; <strong>status was everything</strong>.</p>

        <p>The social order ran from the top down: <strong>Nobles</strong> (great landowners, very rich and powerful) &rarr; <strong>Gentry</strong> (smaller landowners, often judges, growing in importance) &rarr; <strong>Merchants</strong> (made money from trade) &rarr; <strong>Yeomen</strong> (owned their farms) &rarr; <strong>Tenants and the poor</strong> (mainly lived in poverty with low life expectancy).</p>

        <p>Women were seen as the property of men. Few from the gentry and above married for love &mdash; marriages were used to protect wealth or build alliances between rich families.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Great Chain of Being</div>
          <p>People genuinely believed in the <strong>Great Chain of Being</strong> &mdash; the idea that everything in the world had a God-given place: God &rarr; Angels &rarr; Kings and Queens &rarr; Nobles &rarr; Commoners &rarr; Animals &rarr; Plants &rarr; Non-living things. The Queen and the wealthy supported this belief because it justified their power and status.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Queen&rsquo;s Power</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth was the most powerful person in England. She made all the big decisions herself. This is called the <dfn class="term" data-def="The special rights and powers belonging to the monarch alone, including the power to call Parliament, declare war, and decide on religion and marriage.">Royal Prerogative</dfn> &mdash; the monarch&rsquo;s right to call and dismiss Parliament, declare war and make peace, and decide matters of religion and marriage.</p>

        <h3>The Privy Council</h3>

        <p>The Privy Council was a group of about <strong>19</strong> of Elizabeth&rsquo;s most trusted advisors. They met almost every day to help run the country. Mary I had used around 50 councillors &mdash; Elizabeth kept her team small so they were easier to control.</p>

        <p>Key roles on the Privy Council included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Secretary of State</strong> &mdash; the chief advisor, handled day-to-day problems, and was in most regular contact with the Queen. All letters passed through him.</li>
          <li><strong>Lord Treasurer</strong> &mdash; responsible for the country&rsquo;s finances and spending.</li>
          <li><strong>Lord Chamberlain</strong> &mdash; booked Elizabeth&rsquo;s appointments and controlled access to the Queen.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Council also advised on <strong>religion and foreign policy</strong>, controlled what Parliament debated, and organised <strong>spies</strong> to uncover plots against Elizabeth.</p>

        <h4>Elizabeth&rsquo;s Key Advisors</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>William Cecil (Lord Burghley)</strong> &mdash; Elizabeth&rsquo;s most trusted advisor for 40 years, serving as Secretary of State and then Lord Treasurer. He was from the <strong>gentry</strong> and a <strong>Puritan</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Sir Francis Walsingham</strong> &mdash; Secretary of State and spymaster who built a network of double agents and spies to uncover Catholic plots. Also from the gentry and a Puritan.</li>
          <li><strong>Robert Dudley (Earl of Leicester)</strong> &mdash; Elizabeth&rsquo;s close favourite and military commander. A <strong>noble</strong> and moderate Protestant.</li>
          <li><strong>Sir Christopher Hatton</strong> &mdash; Elizabeth&rsquo;s childhood friend who organised the Queen&rsquo;s <dfn class="term" data-def="Summer tours where Elizabeth and her court travelled around the country, staying in nobles&rsquo; homes. They showed the Queen to her people and saved the Crown money on food and lodging.">progresses</dfn>. A moderate Protestant.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; How Elizabeth Controlled the Privy Council</div>
          <p>Elizabeth used several clever tactics to stay in charge:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Delay</strong> &mdash; she took her time making decisions, reminding councillors that she was in control.</li>
            <li><strong>Divide and rule</strong> &mdash; she deliberately chose councillors with different viewpoints so she heard every side of an issue.</li>
            <li><strong>Careful selection</strong> &mdash; she waited <strong>4 years</strong> before adding Robert Dudley to the Privy Council to avoid jealousy among other nobles.</li>
            <li><strong>Rewards</strong> &mdash; loyal councillors were given jobs that made them rich, keeping them loyal.</li>
            <li><strong>Punishments</strong> &mdash; those who upset her were quickly dismissed, which could ruin them financially. She had a sharp tongue and used public displays of anger. Only two councillors ever rebelled &mdash; both were executed.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Parliament</h3>

        <p>Parliament was made up of the <strong>House of Lords</strong> (nobles and bishops) and the <strong>House of Commons</strong> (elected MPs). Its main jobs were to pass laws and agree to taxes. But it had much less power than Parliament today.</p>

        <p>Elizabeth only called Parliament <strong>13 times</strong> in 45 years, usually when she needed money. Parliament sometimes tried to discuss issues like her marriage and the succession, but Elizabeth firmly told them these were part of her Royal Prerogative and not their business. On a few occasions Parliament protested, but this was rare.</p>

        <h3>Local Government</h3>

        <p><strong>Lord Lieutenants:</strong> Nobles appointed by the Queen to take charge of a specific area, such as Lancashire. They raised <dfn class="term" data-def="A military force made up of ordinary citizens, called up in times of emergency to fight for the monarch.">militia</dfn> to fight for the Queen if needed, settled disputes, and collected taxes.</p>

        <p><strong>Justices of the Peace (JPs):</strong> Local gentry chosen to enforce laws in their county. They were unpaid, but it was a high-status role. JPs could send criminals to prison, but <strong>two or more</strong> JPs were needed to sentence someone to death. There were around <strong>1,500 JPs</strong> across England.</p>

        <h3>The Rise of the Gentry</h3>

        <p>Throughout the Tudor period, monarchs promoted members of the <strong>gentry</strong> to important positions &mdash; at the expense of the traditional nobles, whose power slowly shrank. This trend accelerated under Elizabeth. Her two most important advisors, Cecil and Walsingham, were both gentry, not nobles.</p>

        <h3>The Royal Court and Propaganda</h3>

        <p>The royal court was wherever Elizabeth was. It was the centre of all power in the country. Every day at court was like a fashion show &mdash; members competed for the Queen&rsquo;s favour by showing off their wealth, education, and bravery. But nobody could outshine the Queen herself.</p>

        <p>Elizabeth was very clever at controlling her image. This is called <strong>propaganda</strong>, and she needed it because she was a woman ruler in a world run by men.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Portraits:</strong> Carefully designed to show Elizabeth as powerful, wealthy, and ageless. Unflattering portraits were destroyed.</li>
                <li><strong>Progresses:</strong> Summer tours where Elizabeth and her court stayed in nobles&rsquo; homes, letting many people see her. This also saved the Crown money on food and lodging.</li>
                <li><strong>Performances:</strong> Plays, poems, and books praised the Queen, creating the &ldquo;Cult of Gloriana.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Royal Speeches:</strong> Elizabeth was a gifted speaker. Her Tilbury speech before the Spanish Armada inspired courage and loyalty.</li>
                <li><strong>Patronage:</strong> Elizabeth gave jobs, land, and titles to supporters. This kept nobles loyal and competing for her favour.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The government also controlled printing, stopping the spread of criticism.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>In exam answers, always link propaganda back to <strong>why</strong> it was used. Explain how portraits or progresses helped Elizabeth overcome challenges like her gender or religious unrest. Show that propaganda was a <strong>tool of government</strong>, not just vanity. Similarly, when writing about the Privy Council, explain <strong>how</strong> Elizabeth controlled it &mdash; e.g. delay, divide and rule, rewards, and punishments.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Elizabeth ruled through a combination of personal authority, a small and carefully controlled Privy Council, a weak Parliament, and clever propaganda. She used delay, divide and rule, rewards, and punishments to keep her advisors in line, while portraits, progresses, and patronage built public loyalty.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Total control:</strong> Elizabeth held supreme power through the Royal Prerogative, only calling Parliament 13 times in 45 years. She kept her Privy Council small (19 vs Mary&rsquo;s 50) and used tactics like delay and divide-and-rule to stay in charge.</li>
          <li><strong>Key advisors:</strong> Cecil, Walsingham, Dudley, and Hatton were vital, but Elizabeth always had the final say. She promoted gentry over traditional nobles, shifting the balance of power.</li>
          <li><strong>Propaganda as government:</strong> Portraits, progresses, speeches, and patronage all helped Elizabeth project strength and maintain loyalty across a divided country.</li>
        </ul>
