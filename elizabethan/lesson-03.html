        <h2>How Elizabeth Ruled England</h2>

        <p><strong>The Queen:</strong> Queen Elizabeth I was the most powerful person in England. She made all the big decisions. This is called the <strong>Royal Prerogative</strong> &mdash; the special rights and powers that belonged to the monarch alone. These included the power to call and dismiss Parliament, to declare war and make peace, and to decide matters of religion and marriage.</p>

        <h3>The Privy Council</h3>

        <p>This was a group of her most trusted advisors, usually around <strong>19 members</strong>. They met almost every day to help Elizabeth govern the country, manage money, and deal with problems. Famous members included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>William Cecil (Lord Burghley)</strong> &mdash; Elizabeth&rsquo;s most trusted advisor for 40 years, serving as Secretary of State and then Lord Treasurer</li>
          <li><strong>Sir Francis Walsingham</strong> &mdash; Secretary of State and spymaster who uncovered Catholic plots</li>
          <li><strong>Robert Dudley (Earl of Leicester)</strong> &mdash; Elizabeth&rsquo;s close favourite and military commander</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Privy Council</div>
          <p>The Privy Council advised Elizabeth, but she did <strong>not</strong> have to follow their advice. Elizabeth made this clear throughout her reign &mdash; she would listen to counsel but the final decision was always hers. This sometimes caused tension, especially over issues like marriage and the fate of Mary, Queen of Scots.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Parliament</h3>

        <p>Parliament was made up of the <strong>House of Lords</strong> (nobles and bishops) and the <strong>House of Commons</strong> (elected MPs). Parliament&rsquo;s main jobs were to pass laws and agree to taxes. Elizabeth didn&rsquo;t have to call Parliament often, and she could choose to ignore their advice.</p>

        <p>Elizabeth only called Parliament <strong>13 times</strong> in her 45-year reign, usually when she needed money. Parliament tried to discuss issues Elizabeth considered part of her Royal Prerogative &mdash; especially her marriage and the succession &mdash; but she firmly told them these were not their business.</p>

        <h3>Local Government</h3>

        <p><strong>Lord Lieutenants:</strong> These were nobles chosen by the Queen to be in charge of a local area (county). They had to keep order, raise an army if needed, and report back to the Privy Council.</p>
        <p><strong>Justices of the Peace (JPs):</strong> JPs were wealthy local landowners who were responsible for making sure laws were obeyed in their area. They weren&rsquo;t paid but it was a position of high status. There were around <strong>1,500 JPs</strong> across England.</p>

        <h3>Getting the Message Out: Propaganda</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth I was very clever at controlling her image. This is called <strong>propaganda</strong>. It was important because she was a woman ruler in a time when men held most of the power, there were religious divisions, and she needed to build loyalty and national pride.</p>

            <span>Ways Elizabeth Used Propaganda</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Portraits:</strong> Elizabeth&rsquo;s portraits were carefully designed to show her as powerful, wealthy, and ageless. Symbols were often used. Unflattering portraits were ordered to be destroyed.</li>
                <li><strong>Progresses:</strong> Elizabeth and her court would travel around the country and stay in the homes of nobles, allowing many people to see her.</li>
                <li><strong>Writings and Performances:</strong> Plays, poems, and books were written that praised the Queen, creating the &ldquo;Cult of Gloriana.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Royal Speeches:</strong> Elizabeth was a good speaker. Her speeches, like the one at Tilbury before the Spanish Armada, were designed to inspire courage and loyalty.</li>
                <li><strong>Patronage:</strong> Elizabeth gave jobs, land, and titles to people who supported her. This kept nobles loyal and competing for her favour.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The government also controlled what was printed, stopping the spread of ideas critical of the Queen.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When discussing Elizabeth&rsquo;s propaganda, always link it back to <strong>why</strong> it was used. Explain how a specific portrait or a royal progress helped Elizabeth overcome challenges like her gender, religious unrest, or threats from abroad. Show that propaganda was a <strong>tool of government</strong>, not just vanity.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Elizabeth I&rsquo;s government was a mix of her own power, the advice of her Privy Council, and the laws made by Parliament. To stay in control and keep her people loyal, she used propaganda very effectively through portraits, progresses, and the promotion of a positive image, building a powerful idea of herself as &ldquo;Gloriana.&rdquo;</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Royal Prerogative:</strong> Elizabeth held supreme power and made all major decisions herself, only calling Parliament 13 times in 45 years.</li>
          <li><strong>Key advisors:</strong> William Cecil and Francis Walsingham were crucial figures, but Elizabeth always had the final say.</li>
          <li><strong>Propaganda as power:</strong> Portraits, progresses, speeches, and patronage were all used to maintain loyalty and project strength in the face of challenges to her authority.</li>
        </ul>
