        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">How Elizabeth Ruled England</h2>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n2">Tudor Society</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n3">Society under the Tudors was very structured. It was possible to move between groups, but rare and difficult. Respect for those above you was expected at all times &mdash; <strong>status was everything</strong>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">The social order ran from the top down: <strong>Nobles</strong> (great landowners, very rich and powerful) &rarr; <strong>Gentry</strong> (smaller landowners, often judges, growing in importance) &rarr; <strong>Merchants</strong> (made money from trade) &rarr; <strong>Yeomen</strong> (owned their farms) &rarr; <strong>Tenants and the poor</strong> (mainly lived in poverty with low life expectancy).</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">Women were seen as the property of men. Few from the gentry and above married for love &mdash; marriages were used to protect wealth or build alliances between rich families.</p>

        <figure data-narration-id="n6" class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_great_chain.png" alt="The Great Chain of Being shown as a pyramid: God at the top, then the Queen, Nobles, Gentry, Merchants, Yeomen, and Tenants and the Poor at the bottom">
        </figure>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n7">The Queen&rsquo;s Power</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">Elizabeth was the most powerful person in England. She made all the big decisions herself. This is called the <dfn class="term" data-def="The special rights and powers belonging to the monarch alone, including the power to call Parliament, declare war, and decide on religion and marriage.">Royal Prerogative</dfn> &mdash; the monarch&rsquo;s right to call and dismiss Parliament, declare war and make peace, and decide matters of religion and marriage.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">The Privy Council</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">The Privy Council was a group of about <strong>19</strong> of Elizabeth&rsquo;s most trusted advisors. They met almost every day to help run the country. Mary I had used around 50 councillors &mdash; Elizabeth kept her team small so they were easier to control.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">Key roles on the Privy Council included:</p>
        <ul data-narration-id="n33">
          <li><strong>Secretary of State</strong> &mdash; the chief advisor, handled day-to-day problems, and was in most regular contact with the Queen. All letters passed through him.</li>
          <li><strong>Lord Treasurer</strong> &mdash; responsible for the country&rsquo;s finances and spending.</li>
          <li><strong>Lord Chamberlain</strong> &mdash; booked Elizabeth&rsquo;s appointments and controlled access to the Queen.</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-narration-id="n12">The Council also advised on <strong>religion and foreign policy</strong>, controlled what Parliament debated, and organised <strong>spies</strong> to uncover plots against Elizabeth.</p>

        <h4>Elizabeth&rsquo;s Key Advisors</h4>
        <ul data-narration-id="n34">
          <li><strong>William Cecil (Lord Burghley)</strong> &mdash; Elizabeth&rsquo;s most trusted advisor for 40 years, serving as Secretary of State and then Lord Treasurer. He was from the <strong>gentry</strong> and a <strong>Puritan</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Sir Francis Walsingham</strong> &mdash; Secretary of State and spymaster who built a network of double agents and spies to uncover Catholic plots. Also from the gentry and a Puritan.</li>
          <li><strong>Robert Dudley (Earl of Leicester)</strong> &mdash; Elizabeth&rsquo;s close favourite and military commander. A <strong>noble</strong> and moderate Protestant.</li>
          <li><strong>Sir Christopher Hatton</strong> &mdash; Elizabeth&rsquo;s childhood friend who organised the Queen&rsquo;s <dfn class="term" data-def="Summer tours where Elizabeth and her court travelled around the country, staying in nobles&rsquo; homes.">progresses</dfn>. A moderate Protestant.</li>
        </ul>

        <div data-narration-id="n13" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; How Elizabeth Controlled the Privy Council</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n14">Elizabeth used several clever tactics to stay in charge:</p>
          <ul data-narration-id="n35">
            <li><strong>Delay</strong> &mdash; she took her time making decisions, reminding councillors that she was in control.</li>
            <li><strong>Divide and rule</strong> &mdash; she deliberately chose councillors with different viewpoints so she heard every side of an issue.</li>
            <li><strong>Careful selection</strong> &mdash; she waited <strong>4 years</strong> before adding Robert Dudley to the Privy Council to avoid jealousy among other nobles.</li>
            <li><strong>Rewards</strong> &mdash; loyal councillors were given jobs that made them rich, keeping them loyal.</li>
            <li><strong>Punishments</strong> &mdash; those who upset her were quickly dismissed, which could ruin them financially. She had a sharp tongue and used public displays of anger. Only two councillors ever rebelled &mdash; both were executed.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n15">Parliament</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n16">Parliament was made up of the <strong>House of Lords</strong> (nobles and bishops) and the <strong>House of Commons</strong> (elected MPs). Its main jobs were to pass laws and agree to taxes. But it had much less power than Parliament today.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">Elizabeth only called Parliament <strong>13 times</strong> in 45 years, usually when she needed money. Parliament sometimes tried to discuss issues like her marriage and the succession, but Elizabeth firmly told them these were part of her Royal Prerogative and not their business. On a few occasions Parliament protested, but this was rare.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n18">Local Government</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n19"><strong>Lord Lieutenants:</strong> Nobles appointed by the Queen to take charge of a specific area, such as Lancashire. They raised <dfn class="term" data-def="A military force made up of ordinary citizens, called up in times of emergency to fight for the monarch.">militia</dfn> to fight for the Queen if needed, settled disputes, and collected taxes.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n20"><strong>Justices of the Peace (JPs):</strong> Local gentry chosen to enforce laws in their county. They were unpaid, but it was a high-status role. JPs could send criminals to prison, but <strong>two or more</strong> JPs were needed to sentence someone to death. There were around <strong>1,500 JPs</strong> across England.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n21">The Rise of the Gentry</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n22">Throughout the Tudor period, monarchs promoted members of the <strong>gentry</strong> to important positions &mdash; at the expense of the traditional nobles, whose power slowly shrank. This trend accelerated under Elizabeth. Her two most important advisors, Cecil and Walsingham, were both gentry, not nobles.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n23">The Royal Court and Propaganda</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n24">The royal court was wherever Elizabeth was. It was the centre of all power in the country. Every day at court was like a fashion show &mdash; members competed for the Queen&rsquo;s favour by showing off their wealth, education, and bravery. But nobody could outshine the Queen herself.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n25">Elizabeth was very clever at controlling her image. This is called <strong>propaganda</strong>, and she needed it because she was a woman ruler in a world run by men.</p>

            <span>Ways Elizabeth Used Propaganda</span>

              <ul data-narration-id="n36">
                <li><strong>Portraits:</strong> Carefully designed to show Elizabeth as powerful, wealthy, and ageless. Unflattering portraits were destroyed.</li>
                <li><strong>Progresses:</strong> Summer tours where Elizabeth and her court stayed in nobles&rsquo; homes, letting many people see her. This also saved the Crown money on food and lodging.</li>
                <li><strong>Performances:</strong> Plays, poems, and books praised the Queen, creating the &ldquo;Cult of Gloriana.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Royal Speeches:</strong> Elizabeth was a gifted speaker. Her Tilbury speech before the Spanish Armada inspired courage and loyalty.</li>
                <li><strong>Patronage:</strong> Elizabeth gave jobs, land, and titles to supporters. This kept nobles loyal and competing for her favour.</li>
              </ul>
              <p data-narration-id="n26">The government also controlled printing, stopping the spread of criticism.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p data-narration-id="n28">In exam answers, always link propaganda back to <strong>why</strong> it was used. Explain how portraits or progresses helped Elizabeth overcome challenges like her gender or religious unrest. Show that propaganda was a <strong>tool of government</strong>, not just vanity. Similarly, when writing about the Privy Council, explain <strong>how</strong> Elizabeth controlled it &mdash; e.g. delay, divide and rule, rewards, and punishments.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div data-narration-id="n29" class="conclusion">
        <h2 data-narration-id="n30">Conclusion</h2>
        <p data-narration-id="n31">Elizabeth ruled through a combination of personal authority, a small and carefully controlled Privy Council, a weak Parliament, and clever propaganda. She used delay, divide and rule, rewards, and punishments to keep her advisors in line, while portraits, progresses, and patronage built public loyalty.</p>
        <h3 data-narration-id="n32">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul data-narration-id="n37">
          <li><strong>Total control:</strong> Elizabeth held supreme power through the Royal Prerogative, only calling Parliament 13 times in 45 years. She kept her Privy Council small (19 vs Mary&rsquo;s 50) and used tactics like delay and divide-and-rule to stay in charge.</li>
          <li><strong>Key advisors:</strong> Cecil, Walsingham, Dudley, and Hatton were vital, but Elizabeth always had the final say. She promoted gentry over traditional nobles, shifting the balance of power.</li>
          <li><strong>Propaganda as government:</strong> Portraits, progresses, speeches, and patronage all helped Elizabeth project strength and maintain loyalty across a divided country.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: The Privy Council was important because it was the engine of Elizabethan government, but Elizabeth used it as a tool of personal control rather than sharing power. She deliberately kept it small \u2014 about 19 members compared to Mary I\u2019s 50 \u2014 making it easier to manage. She chose councillors with different viewpoints (divide and rule), delayed decisions to remind them she was in charge, and used rewards and punishments to maintain loyalty. Key figures like Cecil (Secretary of State, then Lord Treasurer) and Walsingham (spymaster) depended on royal favour for their positions, as they were gentry rather than traditional nobles. This shift from noble to gentry advisors strengthened the Crown\u2019s authority.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: The Privy Council was important because it advised Elizabeth on key decisions including religion, foreign policy, and security. It met almost daily and had about 19 members. Elizabeth controlled it carefully \u2014 she used delay and \u2018divide and rule\u2019 to stay in charge. Key advisors like William Cecil and Francis Walsingham were from the gentry, which meant they depended on Elizabeth for their status.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The Privy Council was important because it helped Elizabeth run the country. It advised on religion, finance, and foreign policy. It also organised spies to uncover plots against the Queen.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The Privy Council advised Elizabeth. / It helped run the government.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Elizabeth\u2019s use of propaganda was a calculated response to the unique challenges of being a female ruler. Portraits were carefully designed to show her as powerful, wealthy, and ageless \u2014 unflattering images were destroyed. Her summer progresses allowed ordinary people to see the Queen, building personal loyalty while saving the Crown money on food and lodging. Plays, poems, and books created the \u2018Cult of Gloriana,\u2019 turning Elizabeth into an almost mythical figure. Her Tilbury speech before the Spanish Armada was a masterpiece of propaganda, declaring she had \u2018the heart and stomach of a king.\u2019 The government also controlled printing to suppress criticism. Together, these methods helped Elizabeth overcome the prejudice against female rulers.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: Elizabeth used portraits as propaganda \u2014 they were carefully designed to make her look powerful and ageless, and unflattering ones were destroyed. She also went on summer progresses, travelling the country and staying in nobles\u2019 homes, which let people see her and saved money. These methods were important because she was a woman in a world run by men and needed to project strength. Plays and poems created the \u2018Cult of Gloriana\u2019 to build loyalty.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Elizabeth used propaganda to make people support her. She had special portraits painted that showed her as powerful. She also went on progresses around the country so people could see her.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: Elizabeth used portraits and speeches to make herself popular. / She used propaganda to control her image.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: Cecil was the most important figure in Elizabethan government after the Queen herself, serving loyally for 40 years. As Secretary of State, he handled all correspondence and day-to-day problems, giving him enormous influence. His later role as Lord Treasurer gave him control of finances. His appointment was significant because he was gentry, not a nobleman \u2014 part of Elizabeth\u2019s deliberate strategy of promoting men who depended on royal favour. As a Puritan, he helped shape the moderate Religious Settlement and supported a firm line against Catholic threats. His long service provided continuity through decades of religious, political, and military crises.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: Cecil was important because he served as Elizabeth\u2019s chief advisor for 40 years, first as Secretary of State and then as Lord Treasurer. He was from the gentry, not the nobility, which meant he depended on Elizabeth for his position. He advised on religion, foreign policy, and security. His Puritan beliefs helped shape the Religious Settlement of 1559.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance.

Parliament was called only 13 times in 45 years, mainly when Elizabeth needed money, and she firmly blocked MPs from discussing her marriage or the succession, insisting these were Royal Prerogative. Locally, Lord Lieutenants and 1,500 JPs enforced her authority across the country. Rewards \u2014 jobs, land, titles \u2014 kept supporters loyal, while public displays of anger and dismissal punished dissent.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence.

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: The rise of the gentry was important because it fundamentally shifted the balance of power in Tudor England. Throughout the period, monarchs promoted gentry members to key positions at the expense of traditional nobles. Elizabeth accelerated this trend \u2014 her two most important advisors, William Cecil and Francis Walsingham, were both gentry. This was strategically significant: gentry owed their position entirely to royal favour, making them more loyal and controllable than nobles who held power through hereditary right. The gentry also filled local government roles as JPs, giving them influence across the country. This shift weakened the old nobility and strengthened the Crown\u2019s authority.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: The rise of the gentry was important because Elizabeth promoted gentry members like Cecil and Walsingham to the most powerful positions in government. This was significant because gentry depended on Elizabeth for their status, unlike nobles who inherited their power. This made them more loyal. Gentry also served as JPs across England, helping to enforce the law at a local level.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance.

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Local government was essential because Elizabeth could not run the whole country from London alone. Lord Lieutenants were nobles appointed by the Queen to manage specific areas \u2014 they raised militia forces, settled disputes, and collected taxes. Below them, around 1,500 Justices of the Peace (JPs) enforced the law in their counties. JPs were unpaid gentry, but the role carried high social status, which motivated them to serve. Two or more JPs were needed to sentence someone to death, preventing the abuse of power. This system extended Elizabeth\u2019s authority to every corner of England while keeping the gentry invested in the stability of the regime \u2014 their status depended on the Queen\u2019s continued rule.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding.

Lord Lieutenants were nobles who managed areas like Lancashire, raising militia and collecting taxes. JPs were local gentry who enforced the law in their county.

There were about 1,500 JPs across England, and two were needed to sentence someone to death.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence.
