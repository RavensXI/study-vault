        <h2>The Puritan Challenge</h2>

        <h3>What Is Puritanism?</h3>

        <p>Puritans were strict Protestants who believed the Church of England had not gone far enough. They wanted to remove all remaining Catholic practices and create a &ldquo;purer&rdquo; form of worship &mdash; simpler services and a church structure closer to the Bible.</p>

        <h3>Why Did Puritans Challenge Elizabeth?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Religious Settlement (1559):</strong> Puritans felt it kept too many Catholic-looking features &mdash; vestments, bishops, and church decorations.</li>
          <li><strong>Church Hierarchy:</strong> Many Puritans disliked bishops&rsquo; power. They preferred a simpler structure governed by elders (known as <strong>Presbyterianism</strong>).</li>
          <li><strong>Services and Practices:</strong> They wanted to scrap kneeling at communion, the sign of the cross, and wedding rings.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why Puritans Were a Political Threat</div>
          <p>The Puritan challenge was about <strong>power</strong>, not just religion. By questioning the Religious Settlement, Puritans challenged the <dfn class="term" data-def="The monarch&rsquo;s exclusive right to decide certain matters &mdash; in this case, religion.">Royal Prerogative</dfn>. Elizabeth saw any attempt to change her Settlement as an attack on her authority as Supreme Governor of the Church.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How Did Puritans Express Their Opposition?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>In Parliament:</strong> Puritan MPs pushed for further reform. In <strong>1571</strong>, <strong>Walter Strickland</strong> proposed a new prayer book and changes to clerical clothing. Elizabeth shut down the debate before Parliament could discuss it. Other MPs like Peter Wentworth and Thomas Cartwright also tried to pass reform laws. Elizabeth told Parliament that religion was not their business.</li>
          <li><strong>Preaching and &lsquo;Prophesyings&rsquo;:</strong> These were meetings where clergy discussed the Bible and practised preaching. They sometimes became forums for criticising the Church of England.</li>
          <li><strong>Pamphlets and Writings:</strong> The <strong>Marprelate Tracts</strong> (1588&ndash;1589) were illegal pamphlets that attacked bishops with satirical humour. Earlier, the pamphleteer <strong>John Stubbs</strong> publicly attacked Elizabeth&rsquo;s proposed marriage to the Catholic Duke of Alen&ccedil;on, calling it an &ldquo;immoral union.&rdquo; Elizabeth had Stubbs&rsquo;s <strong>right hand chopped off</strong> as punishment &mdash; a clear warning to anyone who challenged her decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Refusal to Conform:</strong> Some clergy refused to wear the prescribed vestments (the <strong>Vestments Controversy</strong> of the 1560s).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Did Elizabeth Respond?</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth relied on her <strong>Archbishops of Canterbury</strong> to enforce conformity:</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_archbishops.png" alt="Infographic comparing Elizabeth's three Archbishops of Canterbury — Parker (moderate), Grindal (sympathetic, suspended), Whitgift (zero tolerance) — showing the escalation from soft to hard approach against Puritans">
        </figure>

        <h3>Puritan Sympathisers in Government</h3>

        <p>Some of Elizabeth&rsquo;s own senior figures were Puritan sympathisers, including the MP <strong>John Field</strong>, the <strong>Earl of Leicester</strong>, and spymaster <strong>Sir Francis Walsingham</strong>. However, they remained <strong>loyal</strong> to Elizabeth. As time went on, these leading Puritans died off and were replaced by moderates. After <strong>1590</strong>, organised Puritan opposition faded.</p>

        <p>Prophesyings were banned. Laws punished those who refused to attend Church of England services. By the end of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, the Puritan movement had been largely contained.</p>

        <h3>How Serious Was the Puritan Threat?</h3>

        <p>Historians disagree about how much of a threat Puritans really posed:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>A genuine threat:</strong> Puritans had support in Parliament and among educated clergy. They challenged the queen&rsquo;s authority on religion &mdash; a key part of her power.</li>
          <li><strong>A limited threat:</strong> Puritans never plotted to overthrow Elizabeth. They were loyal Protestants who wanted reform, not revolution. They had no backing from foreign powers (unlike Catholics). Most ordinary people were happy with the Settlement.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Exam Tip -->
      <div class="exam-tip">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Explain <strong>why</strong> Puritans were a threat (challenging royal supremacy, creating religious division) <strong>and</strong> why it was limited (government action, no foreign backing, loyalty to the queen). A balanced answer scores highly. Compare the Puritan threat to the Catholic threat &mdash; which was more dangerous?</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Puritans were a persistent challenge to Elizabeth&rsquo;s Settlement. However, through her Archbishops &mdash; especially Whitgift &mdash; Elizabeth enforced conformity. After 1590, leading Puritans died off and the movement faded as a political force.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Religious and political challenge:</strong> Puritans pushed for further reform, directly challenging Elizabeth&rsquo;s Royal Prerogative as Supreme Governor.</li>
          <li><strong>Effective government response:</strong> Parker expelled 30 ministers, Grindal was suspended, and Whitgift used fines and imprisonment. Elizabeth also made brutal examples &mdash; like chopping off John Stubbs&rsquo;s hand.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited overall threat:</strong> Puritans never plotted to overthrow Elizabeth and had no foreign backing. After 1590, leading Puritan figures died off and were replaced by moderates.</li>
        </ul>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain that Puritanism was important because it challenged the Religious Settlement on multiple fronts \u2014 in Parliament (Strickland\u2019s 1571 prayer book proposal, Wentworth and Cartwright\u2019s reform bills), through preaching (prophesyings that became forums for criticising the Church of England), and through illegal pamphlets (the Marprelate Tracts of 1588\u20131589). By questioning the Settlement, Puritans challenged the Royal Prerogative itself. Elizabeth saw this as an attack on her authority as Supreme Governor. However, the threat was limited: Puritans never plotted to overthrow Elizabeth, had no foreign backing, and after 1590 leading figures died off. Elizabeth contained the threat through her Archbishops \u2014 Parker expelled ministers, Grindal was suspended, and Whitgift used fines and imprisonment.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: A developed answer might explain that Puritans challenged Elizabeth\u2019s Royal Prerogative by pushing for reform in Parliament and through prophesyings, and that Elizabeth responded through her Archbishops, especially Whitgift who enforced strict conformity.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Puritanism was important because Puritans wanted to change the Religious Settlement and challenged the queen\u2019s authority over religion.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Puritans caused problems because they wanted a different church.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: A complex account might trace how Elizabeth used her Archbishops of Canterbury to enforce conformity over time. Archbishop Parker took a moderate approach but expelled around 30 ministers who refused to wear vestments during the Vestments Controversy of the 1560s. Archbishop Grindal was sympathetic to Puritans and refused to ban prophesyings \u2014 Elizabeth suspended him from office. Archbishop Whitgift took a zero-tolerance approach, using fines and imprisonment to crush non-conformity. Elizabeth also shut down Parliamentary debate when Strickland proposed a new prayer book in 1571, telling Parliament religion was not their business. She made a brutal example of John Stubbs, having his right hand chopped off for attacking her proposed marriage. The Marprelate Tracts (1588\u20131589) were suppressed. After 1590, leading Puritan figures like Leicester and Walsingham died, and the movement faded.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: A developed account might explain how Parker dealt with vestments, Grindal was suspended for supporting prophesyings, and Whitgift used harsh enforcement, showing the escalation from soft to hard approaches.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: A simple account might describe how Elizabeth banned prophesyings and used Whitgift to punish Puritans who refused to conform.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: Elizabeth used her Archbishops to stop Puritans from changing the church.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain the changing approach across three Archbishops. Parker (appointed 1559) took a moderate line but still expelled around 30 ministers during the Vestments Controversy, showing Elizabeth would not tolerate disobedience. Grindal (appointed 1575) was sympathetic to Puritans and refused to suppress prophesyings \u2014 Elizabeth suspended him, demonstrating she would remove even senior churchmen who defied her. Whitgift (appointed 1583) adopted zero tolerance, using fines and imprisonment to enforce conformity. The escalation from Parker to Whitgift shows how the Puritan challenge grew over time and how Elizabeth\u2019s response hardened. The Archbishops were important because they allowed Elizabeth to enforce her Royal Prerogative over religion without appearing to act personally.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: A developed answer might compare Parker\u2019s moderate approach (expelling 30 ministers) with Whitgift\u2019s harsh enforcement (fines and imprisonment), showing how the government\u2019s response to Puritanism escalated.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The Archbishops were important because they enforced the Religious Settlement on Elizabeth\u2019s behalf, punishing clergy who refused to conform.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: The Archbishops helped Elizabeth control the church.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: A complex account might trace the various methods of Puritan opposition. In Parliament, Walter Strickland proposed a new prayer book and clerical clothing changes in 1571 \u2014 Elizabeth shut down the debate. Peter Wentworth and Thomas Cartwright also tried to pass reform laws. Through the church, prophesyings became forums for criticising the Settlement, leading to their suppression. The Vestments Controversy saw clergy refuse prescribed vestments in the 1560s. The Marprelate Tracts (1588\u20131589) used satirical humour to attack bishops. John Stubbs publicly attacked Elizabeth\u2019s proposed marriage to the Duke of Alen\u00e7on and had his right hand chopped off. The account might show how these different methods of opposition built on each other and how each provoked a government response.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: A developed account might explain Parliamentary opposition (Strickland\u2019s 1571 proposal) and the Marprelate Tracts, showing how Puritans used both legal and illegal methods.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: A simple account might describe how Puritans refused to wear vestments and wrote pamphlets attacking bishops.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: Puritans opposed the Settlement by speaking in Parliament and writing pamphlets.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain that the Puritan challenge went beyond religion \u2014 it was about power. By questioning the Religious Settlement, Puritans challenged the Royal Prerogative, Elizabeth\u2019s exclusive right to decide religious matters. If Parliament could dictate church policy, it would undermine the queen\u2019s authority. This is why Elizabeth told Parliament religion was \u2018not their business\u2019 and shut down Strickland\u2019s 1571 debate. Puritans had support among educated clergy and powerful figures like the Earl of Leicester and Walsingham. However, the threat was limited: Puritans never plotted to overthrow Elizabeth, had no foreign backing (unlike Catholics), and most ordinary people were happy with the Settlement. After 1590, leading Puritans died off and were replaced by moderates.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: A developed answer might explain that the Puritan challenge threatened Elizabeth\u2019s Royal Prerogative because they wanted Parliament to change religious policy, and that Elizabeth responded by banning debates and punishing dissenters, but that the threat was limited because Puritans remained loyal.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The Puritan challenge was important because it questioned Elizabeth\u2019s right to control religion, which was a key part of her power.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Puritans challenged Elizabeth\u2019s power over the church.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: A complex account might compare the two threats systematically. Catholics plotted to assassinate Elizabeth (Ridolfi, Throckmorton, Babington plots), had foreign backing from Spain and the Pope, and aimed to replace Elizabeth with Mary, Queen of Scots. Puritans never plotted to overthrow Elizabeth \u2014 they were loyal Protestants who wanted reform, not revolution. Key Puritan sympathisers like the Earl of Leicester and Walsingham served Elizabeth faithfully. The Puritan challenge operated through legal channels (Parliament, preaching) rather than conspiracy. Most ordinary people were content with the Settlement. After 1590, leading Puritan figures died and were replaced by moderates, while the Catholic threat continued until the Armada.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence.
