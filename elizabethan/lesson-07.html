        <h2>The Puritan Challenge</h2>

        <h3>What Is Puritanism?</h3>

        <p>Puritans were strict Protestants who believed the Church of England had not gone far enough. They wanted to remove all remaining Catholic practices and create a &ldquo;purer&rdquo; form of worship &mdash; simpler services and a church structure closer to the Bible.</p>

        <h3>Why Did Puritans Challenge Elizabeth?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Religious Settlement (1559):</strong> Puritans felt it kept too many Catholic-looking features &mdash; vestments, bishops, and church decorations.</li>
          <li><strong>Church Hierarchy:</strong> Many Puritans disliked bishops&rsquo; power. They preferred a simpler structure governed by elders (known as <strong>Presbyterianism</strong>).</li>
          <li><strong>Services and Practices:</strong> They wanted to scrap kneeling at communion, the sign of the cross, and wedding rings.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why Puritans Were a Political Threat</div>
          <p>The Puritan challenge was about <strong>power</strong>, not just religion. By questioning the Religious Settlement, Puritans challenged the <dfn class="term" data-def="The monarch&rsquo;s exclusive right to decide certain matters &mdash; in this case, religion.">Royal Prerogative</dfn>. Elizabeth saw any attempt to change her Settlement as an attack on her authority as Supreme Governor of the Church.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How Did Puritans Express Their Opposition?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>In Parliament:</strong> Puritan MPs pushed for further reform. In <strong>1571</strong>, <strong>Walter Strickland</strong> proposed a new prayer book and changes to clerical clothing. Elizabeth shut down the debate before Parliament could discuss it. Other MPs like Peter Wentworth and Thomas Cartwright also tried to pass reform laws. Elizabeth told Parliament that religion was not their business.</li>
          <li><strong>Preaching and &lsquo;Prophesyings&rsquo;:</strong> These were meetings where clergy discussed the Bible and practised preaching. They sometimes became forums for criticising the Church of England.</li>
          <li><strong>Pamphlets and Writings:</strong> The <strong>Marprelate Tracts</strong> (1588&ndash;1589) were illegal pamphlets that attacked bishops with satirical humour. Earlier, the pamphleteer <strong>John Stubbs</strong> publicly attacked Elizabeth&rsquo;s proposed marriage to the Catholic Duke of Alen&ccedil;on, calling it an &ldquo;immoral union.&rdquo; Elizabeth had Stubbs&rsquo;s <strong>right hand chopped off</strong> as punishment &mdash; a clear warning to anyone who challenged her decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Refusal to Conform:</strong> Some clergy refused to wear the prescribed vestments (the <strong>Vestments Controversy</strong> of the 1560s).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Did Elizabeth Respond?</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth relied on her <strong>Archbishops of Canterbury</strong> to enforce conformity:</p>

          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>The three Archbishops and their approaches</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Archbishop Parker (1559&ndash;1575):</strong> Tried to find a middle way. Issued the <strong>Advertisements</strong> in 1566, ordering all clergy to wear the surplice. <strong>30 ministers</strong> who refused were expelled from their churches.</p>
              <p><strong>Archbishop Grindal (1575&ndash;1583):</strong> More sympathetic to Puritans. He refused Elizabeth&rsquo;s order to ban prophesyings, believing they improved preaching. Elizabeth <strong>suspended him</strong>, and he stayed sidelined until his death.</p>
              <p><strong>Archbishop Whitgift (1583&ndash;1604):</strong> Took a much tougher line. He required all clergy to accept Elizabeth&rsquo;s Settlement and the <strong>39 Articles</strong> in full. Around <strong>300&ndash;400 clergy</strong> initially refused, though most eventually gave in. He used the <strong>Court of High Commission</strong> to fine or imprison those who did not.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Puritan Sympathisers in Government</h3>

        <p>Some of Elizabeth&rsquo;s own senior figures were Puritan sympathisers, including the MP <strong>John Field</strong>, the <strong>Earl of Leicester</strong>, and spymaster <strong>Sir Francis Walsingham</strong>. However, they remained <strong>loyal</strong> to Elizabeth. As time went on, these leading Puritans died off and were replaced by moderates. After <strong>1590</strong>, organised Puritan opposition faded.</p>

        <p>Prophesyings were banned. Laws punished those who refused to attend Church of England services. By the end of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, the Puritan movement had been largely contained.</p>

        <h3>How Serious Was the Puritan Threat?</h3>

        <p>Historians disagree about how much of a threat Puritans really posed:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>A genuine threat:</strong> Puritans had support in Parliament and among educated clergy. They challenged the queen&rsquo;s authority on religion &mdash; a key part of her power.</li>
          <li><strong>A limited threat:</strong> Puritans never plotted to overthrow Elizabeth. They were loyal Protestants who wanted reform, not revolution. They had no backing from foreign powers (unlike Catholics). Most ordinary people were happy with the Settlement.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Exam Tip -->
      <div class="exam-tip">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Explain <strong>why</strong> Puritans were a threat (challenging royal supremacy, creating religious division) <strong>and</strong> why it was limited (government action, no foreign backing, loyalty to the queen). A balanced answer scores highly. Compare the Puritan threat to the Catholic threat &mdash; which was more dangerous?</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Puritans were a persistent challenge to Elizabeth&rsquo;s Settlement. However, through her Archbishops &mdash; especially Whitgift &mdash; Elizabeth enforced conformity. After 1590, leading Puritans died off and the movement faded as a political force.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Religious and political challenge:</strong> Puritans pushed for further reform, directly challenging Elizabeth&rsquo;s Royal Prerogative as Supreme Governor.</li>
          <li><strong>Effective government response:</strong> Parker expelled 30 ministers, Grindal was suspended, and Whitgift used fines and imprisonment. Elizabeth also made brutal examples &mdash; like chopping off John Stubbs&rsquo;s hand.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited overall threat:</strong> Puritans never plotted to overthrow Elizabeth and had no foreign backing. After 1590, leading Puritan figures died off and were replaced by moderates.</li>
        </ul>
