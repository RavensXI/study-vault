        <h2>The Puritan Challenge</h2>

        <h3>What Is Puritanism?</h3>

        <p>Puritans were very committed Protestants who believed the Church of England hadn&rsquo;t gone far enough to remove all traces of Catholic practices. They wanted a &ldquo;purer&rdquo; form of worship, with simpler services and a church structure closer to what the Bible described.</p>

        <h3>Why Did Puritans Challenge Elizabeth?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Religious Settlement (1559):</strong> Puritans felt the Settlement kept too many things that looked Catholic, including vestments, bishops, and certain church decorations.</li>
          <li><strong>Church Hierarchy:</strong> Many Puritans disliked the power of bishops, preferring a simpler church structure governed by elders (known as <strong>Presbyterianism</strong>).</li>
          <li><strong>Services and Practices:</strong> They wanted to get rid of practices like kneeling to receive communion, making the sign of the cross, and using rings in marriage.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why Puritans Were a Political Threat</div>
          <p>The Puritan challenge was not just about religion &mdash; it was about <strong>power</strong>. By questioning the Religious Settlement, Puritans were challenging the Royal Prerogative (the queen&rsquo;s right to decide religious matters). Elizabeth saw any attempt to change her Settlement as an attack on her authority as Supreme Governor of the Church.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How Did Puritans Express Their Opposition?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>In Parliament:</strong> Puritan MPs like Peter Wentworth and Thomas Cartwright tried to pass laws to reform the Church further. Elizabeth blocked these attempts, telling Parliament that religion was not their business.</li>
          <li><strong>Preaching and &lsquo;Prophesyings&rsquo;:</strong> These were meetings where clergy discussed the Bible and practiced preaching. They sometimes became forums for criticising the Church of England.</li>
          <li><strong>Pamphlets and Writings:</strong> The <strong>Marprelate Tracts</strong> (1588&ndash;1589) were illegal pamphlets that attacked bishops with satirical humour.</li>
          <li><strong>Refusal to Conform:</strong> Some clergy refused to wear the prescribed vestments (the <strong>Vestments Controversy</strong> of the 1560s).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Did Elizabeth Respond?</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth relied on her <strong>Archbishops of Canterbury</strong> to enforce conformity:</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>The three Archbishops and their approaches</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Archbishop Parker (1559&ndash;1575):</strong> Tried to find a middle way. Issued the <strong>Advertisements</strong> in 1566, which required all clergy to wear the surplice (a white vestment). Some ministers refused and were suspended.</p>
              <p><strong>Archbishop Grindal (1575&ndash;1583):</strong> More sympathetic to Puritans. He refused Elizabeth&rsquo;s order to ban prophesyings, believing they improved the quality of preaching. Elizabeth <strong>suspended him</strong> from his duties, and he remained sidelined until his death.</p>
              <p><strong>Archbishop Whitgift (1583&ndash;1604):</strong> Took a much tougher stance. He required all clergy to accept Elizabeth&rsquo;s Settlement and the <strong>39 Articles</strong> in full. Around <strong>300&ndash;400 clergy</strong> initially refused, though most eventually conformed. He used the <strong>Court of High Commission</strong> to punish those who did not.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Prophesyings were eventually banned. Laws were passed to punish those who refused to attend Church of England services. By the end of her reign, organised Puritan opposition had been significantly weakened.</p>

        <h3>How Serious Was the Puritan Threat?</h3>

        <p>Historians disagree about how much of a threat the Puritans really posed:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>A genuine threat:</strong> Puritans had support in Parliament and among educated clergy. They challenged the queen&rsquo;s authority on religion, which was a fundamental part of her power.</li>
          <li><strong>A limited threat:</strong> Puritans never plotted to overthrow Elizabeth. They were loyal Protestants who wanted reform, not revolution. They lacked the support of foreign powers (unlike Catholics). Most ordinary people were happy with the Settlement.</li>
        </ul>

      </article>

      <!-- Exam Tip -->
      <div class="exam-tip">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Remember to explain <strong>why</strong> Puritans were a threat (challenging royal supremacy, creating religious division) but also <strong>why their threat was limited</strong> (government action, lack of widespread support for extreme Puritanism, loyalty to the queen). A balanced answer that weighs both sides will score highly. Compare the Puritan threat to the Catholic threat &mdash; which was more dangerous and why?</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Puritans presented a significant and persistent challenge to Elizabeth&rsquo;s religious settlement. However, Elizabeth and her government, particularly under Archbishop Whitgift, took firm measures to enforce conformity. While Puritanism continued as a religious force, its direct political threat was largely contained by the end of the 16th century.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Religious and political challenge:</strong> Puritans wanted to reform the Church further, which challenged Elizabeth&rsquo;s Royal Prerogative and her authority as Supreme Governor.</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple methods of opposition:</strong> Puritans used Parliament, prophesyings, pamphlets, and refusal to conform to push for change.</li>
          <li><strong>Effective government response:</strong> Through her Archbishops &mdash; especially the tough-minded Whitgift &mdash; Elizabeth successfully enforced conformity and weakened organised Puritan opposition.</li>
        </ul>
