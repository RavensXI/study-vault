        <h2>The Rise of the Gentry &amp; Theatre</h2>

        <p>Elizabethan England is often called a &lsquo;Golden Age&rsquo; &mdash; a time of growing wealth, cultural achievement, and national confidence. The <strong>gentry</strong> grew richer and more powerful, while theatre flourished and produced some of the greatest works in the English language. But this prosperity was not shared equally.</p>

        <h3>Elizabethan Society: The Great Chain of Being</h3>

        <p>Elizabethans believed in a strict social hierarchy called the <strong><dfn class="term" data-def="The belief that God had ordered all of creation in a fixed hierarchy, from the monarch at the top to the poorest at the bottom.">Great Chain of Being</dfn></strong>. Everyone had a fixed place. The rise of the gentry was upsetting this established order.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Social Hierarchy</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The Monarch</strong> &mdash; at the very top, appointed by God</li>
            <li><strong>The Nobility</strong> &mdash; about 60 families; dukes, earls, barons with average incomes of &pound;6,000/year</li>
            <li><strong>The Gentry</strong> &mdash; about 10,000 families; landowners, knights, and esquires averaging &pound;1,700/year but growing fast</li>
            <li><strong>Yeomen</strong> &mdash; small landowners and prosperous farmers</li>
            <li><strong>Merchants and craftsmen</strong> &mdash; growing wealth from trade in towns</li>
            <li><strong>Labourers and servants</strong> &mdash; around half the population</li>
            <li><strong>The poor and unemployed</strong> &mdash; a large and growing group</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Rise of the Gentry</h3>

        <p>The <strong>gentry</strong> were the big winners of the Elizabethan period. They sat below the nobility but above ordinary people. During Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, their wealth and influence grew fast.</p>

        <h4>Why Did the Gentry Prosper?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Land from the monasteries:</strong> Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries in the 1530s, so Church land was sold cheaply. Gentry families bought it and grew rich from farming.</li>
          <li><strong>Rising prices:</strong> Wool, grain, and farm products rose in price, making land ownership very profitable. Some gentry also switched to sheep farming, or opened coal mines and iron works.</li>
          <li><strong>Trade and investment:</strong> Many gentry invested in overseas expeditions (e.g. Drake&rsquo;s voyages) and trade with the New World, earning huge profits.</li>
          <li><strong>Tudor suspicion of the nobility:</strong> The Tudors had a weak claim to the crown, so they worried noble families might challenge them. Elizabeth gave top jobs to gentry men like <strong>Walsingham</strong> and <strong>Cecil</strong> through <dfn class="term" data-def="A system where the monarch gave jobs, titles, or land to loyal supporters in return for their service.">patronage</dfn>. This angered nobles like the Earl of Essex, who felt he &mdash; not Cecil &mdash; should be the Queen&rsquo;s closest adviser.</li>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> Sons of the gentry attended the growing number of <strong>grammar schools</strong> and <strong>universities</strong>. This gave them careers in law, politics, and the royal court.</li>
          <li><strong>Political power:</strong> Gentry served as <strong>JPs (Justices of the Peace)</strong> across the countryside, enforcing Elizabeth&rsquo;s laws locally. They also dominated Parliament as MPs.</li>
          <li><strong>Marriage:</strong> Marrying into a richer family allowed gentry to rise in status &mdash; as Bess of Hardwick showed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Case Study: Bess of Hardwick</h4>
        <p><strong>Bess of Hardwick</strong> (born 1527) is a remarkable example of the rising gentry. Born into a lower gentry family in Derbyshire, she married four times &mdash; each husband richer and more powerful than the last:</p>

        </figure>

        <h3>How the Wealthy Displayed Their Status</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Grand houses:</strong> It was a peaceful time, so the rich no longer wanted to live in cold, draughty castles. They built huge country mansions inspired by <strong>Italian Renaissance</strong> designs. These used symmetry, expensive glass windows (a status symbol), and better chimneys so more than one room could be warm. Houses were built for <strong>comfort, not defence</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Fashionable clothing:</strong> Expensive fabrics, ruffs, jewellery, and even make-up (to look pale) showed status. Sumptuary Laws restricted what different classes could wear, though enforcement was weak.</li>
          <li><strong>Libraries and books:</strong> The gentry built great libraries to display their wealth and education.</li>
          <li><strong>Sponsoring plays and entertainment:</strong> The gentry funded theatre companies and hosted events, fuelling the &lsquo;Golden Age&rsquo; and boosting the economy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Elizabethan Theatre</h3>

        <p>When Elizabeth came to power, there was <strong>not a single theatre in England</strong>. Actors had previously travelled and performed at markets and fairs. By the end of her reign, theatres were major cultural centres. This was one of the greatest achievements of the age.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Globe Theatre</div>
          <p>The most famous Elizabethan theatre was <strong>The Globe</strong>, built in 1599 on the south bank of the Thames. It held around <strong>3,000 spectators</strong>. Wealthy people sat in covered galleries, while ordinary people (<strong>&lsquo;groundlings&rsquo;</strong>) stood in the open yard for just one penny.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Why Did Theatre Flourish?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clever playwrights:</strong> Plays were entertaining with themes the audience cared about. A new play went on every 3&ndash;4 days. <strong>William Shakespeare</strong> and <strong>Christopher Marlowe</strong> created dramatic stories with special effects. Cheap tickets meant most people could attend.</li>
          <li><strong>Court patronage:</strong> Nobles sponsored acting companies to impress the Queen. Robert Dudley set up the <strong>Earl of Leicester&rsquo;s Men</strong>. Lord Hunsdon set up the <strong>Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s Men</strong>, which Shakespeare joined. In 1583, Elizabeth set up her own company &mdash; <strong>The Queen&rsquo;s Men</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Government approval:</strong> Elizabeth loved plays, so local councils who had previously banned them now allowed them. Plays were often showcased at court first. Elizabeth&rsquo;s advisers saw their value as <strong>propaganda</strong> &mdash; encouraging plays with positive messages that reinforced the social hierarchy. Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Richard III</em> showed Elizabeth&rsquo;s grandfather Henry VII as a hero and Richard III as an evil monster &mdash; making the Tudors look good.</li>
          <li><strong>Distraction for the poor:</strong> London was busy but not everyone was getting richer. The government felt theatre would distract people from their problems, making rebellion less likely.</li>
          <li><strong>Wealth:</strong> Many Londoners were prospering. Wealthy traders had money for the better seats, and investors put money into new theatres because of the profits.</li>
          <li><strong>Purpose-built theatres:</strong> The first, simply called <strong>&lsquo;The Theatre&rsquo;</strong>, was built by James Burbage in <strong>1576</strong>. Others followed: The Rose, The Swan, and The Globe.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What Was a Visit to the Theatre Like?</h4>
        <p>A visit was a full afternoon out. Plays started at about <strong>3pm</strong> (no artificial lighting), announced by a trumpet. Coloured flags showed the type of play: <strong>white</strong> for comedy, <strong>red</strong> for history, <strong>black</strong> for tragedy. Cheap standing spots were in the pit. The galleries had covered seating. The rich sat in the <strong>Lord&rsquo;s Rooms</strong> above the stage &mdash; on display to show off. Actors wore colourful costumes and used trap doors and sound effects. Women could not perform, so boys played female roles. The audience was often rowdy, shouting and heckling. Afterwards, some visited gambling dens and brothels.</p>

        <h4>Opposition to Theatre</h4>
        <p><strong>Puritans</strong> opposed theatre, calling it a drunken and lawless distraction from worshipping God. The <strong>City of London</strong> banned theatres within the city walls &mdash; which is why they were built in Southwark. There were fears that large crowds could spread <strong>plague</strong> and attract <strong>crime</strong> (cut-purses operated freely). The government also worried theatres could spark rebellion &mdash; the Earl of Essex had used a performance of <em>Richard II</em> to signal his attempted uprising.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p>Theatre crossed class boundaries. Both rich and poor attended, though they sat in very different areas. Plays dealt with power, love, betrayal, and justice &mdash; topics that spoke to all audiences.</p>
              <p>All actors were men. Female roles were played by boys. Acting companies like the <strong>Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s Men</strong> (later the <strong>King&rsquo;s Men</strong>) became famous and successful.</p>
              <p>Shakespeare wrote around <strong>37 plays</strong>: tragedies (<em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>), comedies (<em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em>), and histories (<em>Henry V</em>, <em>Richard III</em>). His work is considered some of the greatest literature in the English language.</p>

        <p>The &lsquo;Golden Age&rsquo; was <strong>not golden for everyone</strong>. When discussing the gentry&rsquo;s prosperity or the rise of theatre, contrast it with the experience of the poor. A strong answer shows that <strong>different groups experienced Elizabethan England very differently</strong>. You could also discuss whether cultural change mainly affected the wealthy &mdash; or whether cheap theatre tickets meant ordinary people benefited too.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The gentry grew richer and more powerful through cheap land, trade, education, and royal patronage. They displayed their wealth through grand Renaissance-style mansions and fashionable living. Theatre &mdash; led by Shakespeare &mdash; was a major cultural achievement, enjoyed by all social classes. But this prosperity was unequal. The &lsquo;Golden Age&rsquo; depended on who you were.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The gentry rose fast:</strong> Cheap monastery land, rising prices, trade, education, and royal patronage made them the most powerful social group below the nobility.</li>
          <li><strong>Theatre was a key cultural achievement:</strong> It grew from nothing to a major industry, supported by court patronage, government propaganda, and brilliant playwrights like Shakespeare.</li>
          <li><strong>Prosperity was unequal:</strong> The gentry&rsquo;s wealth and the brilliance of theatre must be balanced against the poverty many ordinary people still faced.</li>
