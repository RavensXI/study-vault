        <h2 data-narration-id="n1">Elizabeth&rsquo;s Accession &amp; Early Problems</h2>

        <p data-narration-id="n2">Elizabeth I became queen in <strong>1558</strong> at the age of 25. Her early life was full of danger and hardship, but those experiences shaped her into a sharp and determined leader.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n3">The Tudors: An Unlikely Dynasty</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n4">The Tudor family were never expected to rule England. Owen Tudor was a Welsh servant in the king&rsquo;s household who married the king&rsquo;s widow &mdash; a huge scandal. When <strong>Henry VI</strong> suffered from mental illness, a power struggle called the <dfn class="term" data-def="A series of civil wars (1455&ndash;1487) between the House of Lancaster and the House of York for the English throne.">Wars of the Roses</dfn> tore England apart for 30 years. In <strong>1485</strong>, Henry Tudor &mdash; the last Lancastrian lord standing &mdash; defeated <strong>Richard III</strong> at the Battle of Bosworth Field. The unlikely Tudor dynasty had begun.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n5">Henry VII&rsquo;s eldest son Arthur died weeks after marrying the Spanish princess, <strong>Catherine of Aragon</strong>. To keep the alliance with Spain, Henry had his second son marry Arthur&rsquo;s widow. That second son became <strong>Henry VIII</strong> &mdash; Elizabeth&rsquo;s father.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n6">Birth and Early Childhood</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n7">Elizabeth was born on <strong>7 September 1533</strong> to Henry VIII and <strong>Anne Boleyn</strong>. Henry had caused a religious earthquake to marry Anne. The <dfn class="term" data-def="The Bishop of Rome, head of the Catholic Church worldwide.">Pope</dfn> refused to grant him a divorce from Catherine of Aragon, so Henry broke away from the Catholic Church and set up the <strong>Church of England</strong>.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n8">Henry desperately wanted a son. When Elizabeth was born a girl, he was disappointed. Anne then had two miscarriages and could not produce a male heir. Henry grew tired of her and had her <strong>executed in 1536</strong>, when Elizabeth was just two. Elizabeth was declared <dfn class="term" data-def="Born to parents not legally married; in Tudor times this meant someone had no right to inherit the throne.">illegitimate</dfn> and removed from royal favour.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n9">Education and Character</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n10">Despite her difficult start, Elizabeth received an outstanding education. She learned Latin, Greek, French, and Italian, along with history, philosophy, and religion. Her tutor <strong>Roger Ascham</strong> admired her intelligence and dedication.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n11">Elizabeth also loved the arts. She enjoyed plays, dancing, and music, and took a keen interest in new discoveries &mdash; her reign would overlap with the <dfn class="term" data-def="A cultural movement (14th&ndash;17th century) that revived interest in classical learning, art, and science.">Renaissance</dfn>.</p>

        <div data-narration-id="n12" class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Elizabeth&rsquo;s Languages</div>
          <p data-narration-id="n13">Elizabeth spoke <strong>five languages</strong> fluently &mdash; English, Latin, Greek, French, and Italian. This gave her a major advantage in diplomacy, letting her negotiate directly with foreign ambassadors without translators.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n14">Religious Turmoil</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n15">England&rsquo;s religion kept changing with each new monarch. Henry VIII&rsquo;s third wife, <strong>Jane Seymour</strong>, gave him a son &mdash; <strong>Edward VI</strong>. Edward became king aged just 9 and was raised as a Protestant. He and his Protestant advisors pushed England further away from Catholicism. Catholic priests who refused to change risked punishment or execution.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n16">Edward died aged <strong>15</strong>. His older sister <strong>Mary I</strong> took over. Mary was Catherine of Aragon&rsquo;s daughter and a devoted Catholic. She reversed Edward&rsquo;s changes, married the Catholic King of Spain, <strong>Philip II</strong>, and burned around <strong>300 Protestants</strong> at the stake in just four years. This earned her the nickname <strong>&ldquo;Bloody Mary.&rdquo;</strong></p>

        <p data-narration-id="n17">A third group also emerged: the <dfn class="term" data-def="Strict Protestants who wanted to &lsquo;purify&rsquo; the Church of all Catholic practices.">Puritans</dfn>. These were very strict Protestants who wanted a simple life based purely on the Bible, with no music, theatre, or decoration in churches.</p>

        <figure data-narration-id="n18" class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_tudor_religion.png" alt="Diagram showing how England's official religion swung between Catholicism and Protestantism under Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I">
        </figure>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n19">Political Danger</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n20">Under Mary, Elizabeth was in real danger. Mary suspected her of plotting and locked her in the <strong>Tower of London in 1554</strong>. Elizabeth&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;Tide Letter,&rdquo; begging Mary to believe her innocence, shows how clever and persuasive she could be.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n21">As a teenager, Elizabeth was also assaulted by <strong>Thomas Seymour</strong>, a powerful lord who was 25 years older. He wanted to marry her to gain power &mdash; she was only about <strong>13</strong>. This experience, along with watching her mother&rsquo;s execution and her sister&rsquo;s manipulation by Philip II, made Elizabeth deeply distrustful of men&rsquo;s intentions.</p>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n22">The Road to the Throne</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n23">Mary died childless in <strong>November 1558</strong>. Elizabeth became queen, but the country was in a terrible state. One of her Privy Councillors, <strong>Armagil Waad</strong>, described England as &ldquo;exhausted,&rdquo; with the people &ldquo;disorderly,&rdquo; a lack of good leaders and soldiers, and wars with France and Scotland.</p>

        <figure data-narration-id="n24" class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_1558_problems.png" alt="Mind-map diagram showing the six key challenges Elizabeth I faced when she became Queen in 1558: religious division, financial crisis, weak military, foreign threats, gender prejudice, and legitimacy questioned">
        </figure>

        <h3 data-narration-id="n25">Elizabeth&rsquo;s Strengths as a Leader</h3>

        <p data-narration-id="n26">Elizabeth had learned from the mistakes of her father, brother, and sister. She saw how quick, angry decisions often led to disaster. As a result, she deliberately <strong>delayed important decisions</strong> &mdash; taking her time to weigh up all sides before acting.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n27">She understood the power of image. She had seen how unpopular Mary became, so she always tried to present herself in a positive way to win the public&rsquo;s support.</p>

        <p data-narration-id="n28">One of her first moves was appointing <strong>William Cecil</strong> (later Lord Burghley) as her chief advisor. He was loyal and capable. She also introduced the <strong>1559 Religious Settlement</strong>, which aimed to end the religious fighting by creating a middle ground. These early decisions helped to steady England quickly.</p>

      <!-- Exam Tip -->
      <div data-narration-id="n29" class="exam-tip">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p data-narration-id="n30">The exam starts from <strong>1558</strong>, but Elizabeth&rsquo;s background is still useful context. Mentioning her early experiences &mdash; like the religious changes or the Thomas Seymour incident &mdash; shows the examiner you understand <strong>why</strong> she acted the way she did. Always explain causes, not just describe events.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div data-narration-id="n31" class="conclusion">
        <h2 data-narration-id="n32">Conclusion</h2>
        <p data-narration-id="n33">Elizabeth&rsquo;s early life was full of danger, but those experiences made her cautious, clever, and resilient. By 1558 she faced religious division, debt, foreign threats, and prejudice against her gender &mdash; yet she moved quickly to steady the country.</p>
        <h3 data-narration-id="n34">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A dangerous path to power:</strong> Elizabeth survived her mother&rsquo;s execution, being declared illegitimate, and imprisonment in the Tower before becoming queen.</li>
          <li><strong>A country in crisis:</strong> In 1558 England was divided by religion, deep in debt, militarily weak, and threatened by France and Scotland.</li>
          <li><strong>A prepared leader:</strong> Elizabeth learned from her predecessors&rsquo; mistakes, appointed strong advisors like William Cecil, and introduced the Religious Settlement to bring stability.</li>
        </ul>

        text: "Write an account of the difficulties which faced Queen Elizabeth as a female ruler.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Elizabeth faced interconnected difficulties as a female ruler. Many believed women were too weak to govern \u2014 yet she needed to command armies, control powerful male nobles, and negotiate with foreign kings. Her gender made the marriage question especially dangerous: if she married, her husband would expect to rule, as Tudor wives were legally subordinate. Her sister Mary I\u2019s marriage to Philip II had dragged England into Spanish wars and lost Calais, showing the risks. Elizabeth\u2019s response was to build the \u2018Virgin Queen\u2019 image, using her unmarried status as propaganda to project independence.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: One difficulty was that many people believed a woman could not rule alone. Tudor society expected women to obey men, and Parliament repeatedly pressured Elizabeth to marry and produce an heir. Without a male partner, some questioned how she could lead an army or control the Privy Council. Elizabeth overcame this by appointing strong advisors like William Cecil and by deliberately delaying decisions to show she was in charge.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Elizabeth had difficulty because she was a woman. People thought women were not strong enough to be queen. She was also under pressure to marry, but every suitor had problems.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: Elizabeth was a woman and people did not think she could rule. / She had problems because of her gender.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        text: "Explain what was important about Elizabeth\u2019s early life in shaping her as a ruler.",
        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: Elizabeth\u2019s early life was crucial in shaping her cautious, distrustful approach to power. Her mother Anne Boleyn was executed when she was two, and she was declared illegitimate. As a teenager, Thomas Seymour\u2019s inappropriate advances taught her how men used women for political gain. Being imprisoned in the Tower under Mary I showed her the dangers of religious division. These combined experiences made her deeply reluctant to marry, skilled at reading political danger, and determined to control her own image \u2014 all defining features of her 45-year reign.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: Elizabeth\u2019s early life was important because it taught her to be cautious. Her mother was executed by Henry VIII, which made her aware of how quickly powerful people could fall. She was also imprisoned in the Tower by Mary I in 1554, accused of plotting. These experiences made her reluctant to trust others easily and influenced her decision-making style of deliberate delay.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Elizabeth\u2019s early life was important because her mother Anne Boleyn was executed when Elizabeth was only two. This meant she grew up knowing that powerful people could be killed, which made her more careful as queen.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Elizabeth had a difficult childhood. / Her mother was executed and she was sent to the Tower.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Elizabeth inherited a country in crisis, and the problems were deeply interconnected. Religious division was the most dangerous \u2014 25 years of swings between Catholicism and Protestantism had left the country torn, with Mary I\u2019s burning of 300 Protestants still fresh in memory. This religious instability linked directly to foreign threats: Catholic France and Scotland were allied, and Spain\u2019s Philip II expected to maintain Catholic influence. England was also \u00a3300,000 in debt and militarily weak \u2014 the loss of Calais to France in 1558 had humiliated the nation. Elizabeth\u2019s response was to appoint William Cecil, introduce the Religious Settlement, and avoid expensive foreign entanglements.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: One major problem was religious division. England had swung between Protestantism under Edward VI and Catholicism under Mary I, who burned around 300 Protestants. Elizabeth needed to find a middle way that most people could accept. Another problem was the country\u2019s finances \u2014 England was deep in debt after Mary\u2019s wars. Elizabeth appointed William Cecil to help steady the country and introduced the Religious Settlement of 1559.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Elizabeth faced many problems in 1558. The country was divided over religion and was in debt. She also faced threats from France and Scotland. She appointed William Cecil to help her.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: England had many problems when Elizabeth became queen. / The country was in a bad state.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: Cecil\u2019s appointment was important because it demonstrated Elizabeth\u2019s political intelligence from the very start of her reign. Rather than choosing a powerful nobleman who might challenge her authority, she picked a member of the gentry \u2014 someone talented but dependent on royal favour. This set a pattern for her entire reign: promoting capable men from lower ranks who owed everything to her. Cecil served loyally for 40 years, first as Secretary of State then as Lord Treasurer, providing continuity and stability through religious crises, foreign threats, and Catholic plots. His Puritan sympathies also helped shape the moderate Protestant Religious Settlement.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: Cecil was important because he provided Elizabeth with loyal, experienced advice for 40 years. As Secretary of State, he handled day-to-day government and helped design the Religious Settlement of 1559. Elizabeth chose him because he was from the gentry, not the old nobility, which meant he depended on her for his position \u2014 making him less likely to challenge her authority.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Cecil was important because he was loyal and helped Elizabeth run the country. He served as Secretary of State and later Lord Treasurer, advising on religion and foreign policy.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Cecil was Elizabeth\u2019s most important advisor. / He helped her make decisions.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The religious changes created a deeply divided country that Elizabeth had to unite. Henry VIII\u2019s break with Rome in the 1530s created the Church of England, but it remained largely Catholic in practice. Edward VI then pushed England sharply Protestant, punishing Catholic priests. Mary I reversed everything, restoring Catholicism and burning around 300 Protestants. By 1558, people had been forced to change their religion three times in a generation. Elizabeth needed to find a settlement that satisfied Catholics, Protestants, and the growing Puritan movement \u2014 while also preventing the kind of religious violence tearing apart France.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: Henry VIII broke with Rome in the 1530s so he could divorce Catherine of Aragon. Under Edward VI, England became more Protestant \u2014 Catholic practices were banned. Then Mary I reversed everything, burning about 300 Protestants. This meant that by 1558, the country was deeply split. Elizabeth had to create a Religious Settlement that could satisfy both sides, which led to the 1559 \u2018middle way.\u2019\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Religion kept changing under the Tudors. Henry VIII broke from Rome, Edward VI was Protestant, and Mary I was Catholic. This meant Elizabeth had to deal with a divided country when she became queen.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: The Tudors changed religion many times. / Elizabeth had to deal with religious problems.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: Elizabeth\u2019s legitimacy was important because it was linked directly to religion, which in turn affected her security. Henry VIII had declared Elizabeth illegitimate after executing Anne Boleyn. Although Henry later restored her to the succession, the Pope never recognised the marriage to Anne Boleyn, meaning Catholics considered Elizabeth a bastard with no right to rule. This gave Mary, Queen of Scots \u2014 a legitimate Catholic heir through Margaret Tudor \u2014 a rival claim. The legitimacy question therefore made Elizabeth vulnerable to Catholic plots and foreign intervention throughout her reign, and partly explains why she introduced the Religious Settlement as a compromise.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: Elizabeth\u2019s legitimacy was important because many Catholics did not accept her as the rightful queen. Henry VIII had declared her illegitimate after Anne Boleyn\u2019s execution, and the Pope never recognised the marriage. This meant Catholic rivals like Mary, Queen of Scots could claim the throne, creating a constant threat of plots and rebellion throughout Elizabeth\u2019s reign.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Elizabeth\u2019s legitimacy was questioned because Henry VIII had declared her illegitimate. Catholics did not accept her as queen because the Pope had not recognised her mother\u2019s marriage.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance.
