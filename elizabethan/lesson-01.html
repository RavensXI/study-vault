        <h2>Elizabeth&rsquo;s Accession &amp; Early Problems</h2>

        <p>Elizabeth I is one of England&rsquo;s most famous queens, and her journey to the throne was anything but easy. She became queen in <strong>1558</strong> at the age of 25, but her early life was full of challenges that shaped the smart and strong leader she would become.</p>

        <h3>Birth and Early Childhood</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth was born on <strong>7 September 1533</strong> to Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Her birth was a big deal at first, but because she was a girl, her father was disappointed. Things got worse when her mother couldn&rsquo;t have a son &mdash; Henry had Anne executed when Elizabeth was just two years old. After that, Elizabeth was declared illegitimate and removed from royal favour. Despite this rocky start, these experiences taught Elizabeth how to be tough and independent.</p>

        <h3>Education and Formation</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth had an amazing education, especially for a girl in her time. She learned Latin, Greek, French, and Italian, along with history, philosophy, and religion. Her tutors, like <strong>Roger Ascham</strong>, admired her for being so smart and eager to learn. This education helped her become a great ruler who could hold her own in politics and religion.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Elizabeth&rsquo;s Languages</div>
          <p>Elizabeth could speak <strong>five languages</strong> fluently &mdash; English, Latin, Greek, French, and Italian. This was a remarkable achievement and gave her a major advantage in diplomacy, allowing her to negotiate directly with foreign ambassadors without translators.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Religious Turmoil and Political Danger</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth grew up in a time of religious chaos. When her Protestant half-brother <strong>Edward VI</strong> was king, she had some peace. But when her Catholic half-sister <strong>Mary I</strong> took over, things got dangerous. Mary suspected Elizabeth of plotting against her and even locked her in the <strong>Tower of London in 1554</strong>. Elizabeth&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;Tide Letter&rdquo; to Mary, where she defended herself, shows how clever and persuasive she could be.</p>

        <h3>The Road to the Throne</h3>

        <p>When Mary died childless in <strong>November 1558</strong>, Elizabeth became queen. The country was a mess: people were divided over religion, the government was broke, and England had few allies. Elizabeth&rsquo;s first job was to calm things down and prove that she could rule as a woman in a man&rsquo;s world.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Problems Elizabeth Faced in 1558</div>
          <p>When Elizabeth became queen, she inherited a country facing serious difficulties:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Religious division</strong> &mdash; England had swung between Protestantism and Catholicism for 25 years</li>
            <li><strong>Financial problems</strong> &mdash; the Crown was in debt after expensive wars</li>
            <li><strong>Weak military</strong> &mdash; England had recently lost Calais to France in 1558</li>
            <li><strong>Gender</strong> &mdash; many believed a woman could not rule effectively</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimacy</strong> &mdash; Catholics considered Elizabeth illegitimate as Henry VIII&rsquo;s marriage to Anne Boleyn was not recognised by the Pope</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Elizabeth&rsquo;s Early Policies and Advisors</h3>

        <p>One of her first moves was appointing <strong>William Cecil</strong> (later Lord Burghley) as her top advisor. He was smart and loyal, and together they laid the groundwork for Elizabeth&rsquo;s long and successful reign. She also surrounded herself with other capable people, but she always made it clear that she was in charge.</p>

        <h3>Public Perception and Initial Reforms</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s charm and intelligence won people over quickly. In her first speeches, she promised to serve her people and follow God&rsquo;s will. She introduced the <strong>1559 Religious Settlement</strong>, which aimed to end the fighting between Catholics and Protestants by creating a middle ground. This helped bring some stability to England.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>While you won&rsquo;t be directly asked about Elizabeth&rsquo;s early life in the exam (the topic starts from 1558, the year she became queen), understanding her background is still very useful. Adding these details to your answers about her later actions, like the Religious Settlement or her handling of Parliament, shows a strong understanding of wider context. Always explain <strong>why</strong> Elizabeth faced problems, not just <strong>what</strong> they were.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s early life was filled with hardships, but those challenges shaped her into a strong and smart leader. By the time she became queen, she was ready to handle the pressures of ruling a divided country. Her reign, often called the &ldquo;Elizabethan Golden Age,&rdquo; was one of the most successful in English history.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A difficult start:</strong> Elizabeth survived her mother&rsquo;s execution, being declared illegitimate, and imprisonment in the Tower of London before becoming queen.</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple challenges in 1558:</strong> Religious division, financial problems, a weak military, questions about her legitimacy, and prejudice against female rulers all threatened her position.</li>
          <li><strong>Strong foundations:</strong> By appointing capable advisors like William Cecil and introducing the Religious Settlement, Elizabeth quickly began to stabilise England.</li>
        </ul>
