        <h2>Elizabeth&rsquo;s Accession &amp; Early Problems</h2>

        <p>Elizabeth I became queen in <strong>1558</strong> at the age of 25. Her early life was full of danger and hardship, but those experiences shaped her into a sharp and determined leader.</p>

        <h3>The Tudors: An Unlikely Dynasty</h3>

        <p>The Tudor family were never expected to rule England. Owen Tudor was a Welsh servant in the king&rsquo;s household who married the king&rsquo;s widow &mdash; a huge scandal. When <strong>Henry VI</strong> suffered from mental illness, a power struggle called the <dfn class="term" data-def="A series of civil wars (1455&ndash;1487) between the House of Lancaster and the House of York for the English throne.">Wars of the Roses</dfn> tore England apart for 30 years. In <strong>1485</strong>, Henry Tudor &mdash; the last Lancastrian lord standing &mdash; defeated <strong>Richard III</strong> at the Battle of Bosworth Field. The unlikely Tudor dynasty had begun.</p>

        <p>Henry VII&rsquo;s eldest son Arthur died weeks after marrying the Spanish princess, <strong>Catherine of Aragon</strong>. To keep the alliance with Spain, Henry had his second son marry Arthur&rsquo;s widow. That second son became <strong>Henry VIII</strong> &mdash; Elizabeth&rsquo;s father.</p>

        <h3>Birth and Early Childhood</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth was born on <strong>7 September 1533</strong> to Henry VIII and <strong>Anne Boleyn</strong>. Henry had caused a religious earthquake to marry Anne. The <dfn class="term" data-def="The Bishop of Rome, head of the Catholic Church worldwide.">Pope</dfn> refused to grant him a divorce from Catherine of Aragon, so Henry broke away from the Catholic Church and set up the <strong>Church of England</strong>.</p>

        <p>Henry desperately wanted a son. When Elizabeth was born a girl, he was disappointed. Anne then had two miscarriages and could not produce a male heir. Henry grew tired of her and had her <strong>executed in 1536</strong>, when Elizabeth was just two. Elizabeth was declared <dfn class="term" data-def="Born to parents not legally married; in Tudor times this meant someone had no right to inherit the throne.">illegitimate</dfn> and removed from royal favour.</p>

        <h3>Education and Character</h3>

        <p>Despite her difficult start, Elizabeth received an outstanding education. She learned Latin, Greek, French, and Italian, along with history, philosophy, and religion. Her tutor <strong>Roger Ascham</strong> admired her intelligence and dedication.</p>

        <p>Elizabeth also loved the arts. She enjoyed plays, dancing, and music, and took a keen interest in new discoveries &mdash; her reign would overlap with the <dfn class="term" data-def="A cultural movement (14th&ndash;17th century) that revived interest in classical learning, art, and science.">Renaissance</dfn>.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Elizabeth&rsquo;s Languages</div>
          <p>Elizabeth spoke <strong>five languages</strong> fluently &mdash; English, Latin, Greek, French, and Italian. This gave her a major advantage in diplomacy, letting her negotiate directly with foreign ambassadors without translators.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Religious Turmoil</h3>

        <p>England&rsquo;s religion kept changing with each new monarch. Henry VIII&rsquo;s third wife, <strong>Jane Seymour</strong>, gave him a son &mdash; <strong>Edward VI</strong>. Edward became king aged just 9 and was raised as a Protestant. He and his Protestant advisors pushed England further away from Catholicism. Catholic priests who refused to change risked punishment or execution.</p>

        <p>Edward died aged <strong>15</strong>. His older sister <strong>Mary I</strong> took over. Mary was Catherine of Aragon&rsquo;s daughter and a devoted Catholic. She reversed Edward&rsquo;s changes, married the Catholic King of Spain, <strong>Philip II</strong>, and burned around <strong>300 Protestants</strong> at the stake in just four years. This earned her the nickname <strong>&ldquo;Bloody Mary.&rdquo;</strong></p>

        <p>A third group also emerged: the <dfn class="term" data-def="Strict Protestants who wanted to &lsquo;purify&rsquo; the Church of all Catholic practices. They wanted plain churches, no vestments, and worship based purely on the Bible.">Puritans</dfn>. These were very strict Protestants who wanted a simple life based purely on the Bible, with no music, theatre, or decoration in churches.</p>

          <img src="diagram_tudor_religion.png" alt="Diagram showing how England's official religion swung between Catholicism and Protestantism under Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I">
        </figure>

        <h3>Political Danger</h3>

        <p>Under Mary, Elizabeth was in real danger. Mary suspected her of plotting and locked her in the <strong>Tower of London in 1554</strong>. Elizabeth&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;Tide Letter,&rdquo; begging Mary to believe her innocence, shows how clever and persuasive she could be.</p>

        <p>As a teenager, Elizabeth was also assaulted by <strong>Thomas Seymour</strong>, a powerful lord who was 25 years older. He wanted to marry her to gain power &mdash; she was only about <strong>13</strong>. This experience, along with watching her mother&rsquo;s execution and her sister&rsquo;s manipulation by Philip II, made Elizabeth deeply distrustful of men&rsquo;s intentions.</p>

        <h3>The Road to the Throne</h3>

        <p>Mary died childless in <strong>November 1558</strong>. Elizabeth became queen, but the country was in a terrible state. One of her Privy Councillors, <strong>Armagil Waad</strong>, described England as &ldquo;exhausted,&rdquo; with the people &ldquo;disorderly,&rdquo; a lack of good leaders and soldiers, and wars with France and Scotland.</p>

        </figure>

        <h3>Elizabeth&rsquo;s Strengths as a Leader</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth had learned from the mistakes of her father, brother, and sister. She saw how quick, angry decisions often led to disaster. As a result, she deliberately <strong>delayed important decisions</strong> &mdash; taking her time to weigh up all sides before acting.</p>

        <p>She understood the power of image. She had seen how unpopular Mary became, so she always tried to present herself in a positive way to win the public&rsquo;s support.</p>

        <p>One of her first moves was appointing <strong>William Cecil</strong> (later Lord Burghley) as her chief advisor. He was loyal and capable. She also introduced the <strong>1559 Religious Settlement</strong>, which aimed to end the religious fighting by creating a middle ground. These early decisions helped to steady England quickly.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>The exam starts from <strong>1558</strong>, but Elizabeth&rsquo;s background is still useful context. Mentioning her early experiences &mdash; like the religious changes or the Thomas Seymour incident &mdash; shows the examiner you understand <strong>why</strong> she acted the way she did. Always explain causes, not just describe events.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s early life was full of danger, but those experiences made her cautious, clever, and resilient. By 1558 she faced religious division, debt, foreign threats, and prejudice against her gender &mdash; yet she moved quickly to steady the country.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A dangerous path to power:</strong> Elizabeth survived her mother&rsquo;s execution, being declared illegitimate, and imprisonment in the Tower before becoming queen.</li>
          <li><strong>A country in crisis:</strong> In 1558 England was divided by religion, deep in debt, militarily weak, and threatened by France and Scotland.</li>
          <li><strong>A prepared leader:</strong> Elizabeth learned from her predecessors&rsquo; mistakes, appointed strong advisors like William Cecil, and introduced the Religious Settlement to bring stability.</li>
        </ul>
