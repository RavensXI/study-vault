        <h2>Mary, Queen of Scots</h2>

        <p>Mary, Queen of Scots was Elizabeth&rsquo;s Catholic cousin and one of the biggest threats to her reign. For <strong>19 years</strong> (1568&ndash;1587), Mary was held prisoner in England, becoming a constant focal point for Catholic plots.</p>

        <h3>Mary&rsquo;s Claim to the English Throne</h3>

        <p>Mary Stuart was the granddaughter of <strong>Margaret Tudor</strong>, Henry VIII&rsquo;s sister. This gave her a strong blood claim to the English throne. Many Catholics believed Mary&rsquo;s claim was <strong>stronger</strong> than Elizabeth&rsquo;s, because the Pope had never recognised Henry VIII&rsquo;s marriage to Anne Boleyn &mdash; making Elizabeth illegitimate in Catholic eyes. Mary had even <strong>claimed the title of Queen of England</strong> while married to the French king.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Mary&rsquo;s Background</div>
          <p>Mary became Queen of Scotland when she was just <strong>six days old</strong> in 1542. She was raised in France, married the French king (Francis II), and returned to Scotland as a widow in <strong>1561</strong>. She was Catholic in a country turning Protestant, which caused tension from the start.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mary&rsquo;s Downfall in Scotland</h3>

        <p>Mary&rsquo;s time as Queen of Scotland was troubled. Her second husband, <strong>Lord Darnley</strong>, was murdered in <strong>1567</strong> in suspicious circumstances. Just three months later, Mary married the <strong>Earl of Bothwell</strong> &mdash; the chief suspect in Darnley&rsquo;s murder. This outraged the Scottish nobles.</p>

        <p>The Scottish lords rebelled. Mary was forced to <dfn class="term" data-def="To formally give up the throne.">abdicate</dfn> in favour of her infant son, <strong>James VI</strong>, in July 1567. After escaping prison, she lost a final battle and fled across the border into <strong>England in May 1568</strong>. She arrived on the coast of north-west England, exhausted and in rough clothing, and was taken to <strong>Carlisle Castle</strong> where she demanded to see her cousin Elizabeth.</p>

        <h3>Elizabeth&rsquo;s Dilemma</h3>

        <p>Mary&rsquo;s arrival put Elizabeth in an impossible position. She had <strong>five options</strong>, and none were good:</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_elizabeth_dilemma.png" alt="Decision tree showing Elizabeth I's five options when Mary Queen of Scots arrived in 1568: help her regain Scotland, let her go to France, send her back for trial, execute her, or keep her prisoner — each with serious risks">
        </figure>

        <p>Elizabeth chose <strong>option 5</strong> &mdash; what some historians have called <strong>&ldquo;the least worst option.&rdquo;</strong> Mary was kept in various English castles under guard for the next 19 years. Elizabeth refused to visit or release her, despite Mary&rsquo;s many moving letters to her cousin. But Mary&rsquo;s existence as a Catholic claimant made her a magnet for conspirators.</p>

        <h3>The Northern Rebellion, 1569</h3>

        <p>Mary&rsquo;s presence quickly triggered a crisis. The <strong>Duke of Norfolk</strong> &mdash; England&rsquo;s most powerful nobleman, who had royal blood and Catholic sympathies &mdash; planned to marry Mary. Elizabeth was furious. Norfolk was imprisoned, and his supporters were ordered to attend court. Instead, the Earls of <strong>Northumberland</strong> and <strong>Westmorland</strong> rebelled.</p>

        <p>The rebellion had a mix of <strong>religious, political, and economic</strong> causes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Religion:</strong> The northern countryside still clung to Catholic beliefs. The rebels wanted to restore Catholicism and free Mary.</li>
          <li><strong>Power:</strong> The <dfn class="term" data-def="A government body based in York that managed law and order in the north of England on behalf of the monarch.">Council of the North</dfn> had taken power from the traditional nobility. Elizabeth gave important jobs to men she could control directly, angering the old Earls.</li>
          <li><strong>Money:</strong> The Earls had lost land. Northumberland had lost valuable <strong>copper mines</strong>. They blamed Elizabeth&rsquo;s advisors &mdash; especially <strong>Robert Cecil</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In <strong>November 1569</strong>, nearly <strong>5,000 rebels</strong> marched south. They forced their way into <strong>Durham Cathedral</strong>, overturned the Protestant communion table, held a Catholic Mass, and destroyed Protestant prayer books. The rebels wore Catholic badges and carried Catholic banners.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why the Northern Rebellion Failed</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Mary was moved further south before the rebels could reach her</li>
            <li>No foreign help arrived &mdash; Spain and the Pope did not send support</li>
            <li>Many northern gentry refused to join</li>
            <li>A royal army of <strong>14,000 men</strong> was raised, far outnumbering the rebels</li>
            <li>Westmorland escaped and died in poverty in the Netherlands</li>
            <li>Northumberland was captured in <strong>1572</strong>. He was offered the chance to save his life by <strong>renouncing his Catholic beliefs</strong> &mdash; he refused and was beheaded</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Consequences of the Northern Rebellion</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s response was harsh. Around <strong>800 rebels</strong> were executed as a warning. The rebellion proved that Mary&rsquo;s presence in England was a genuine threat &mdash; and that some English Catholics were willing to take up arms.</p>

        <p>The aftermath led to tighter controls on Catholics and greater suspicion of Mary. The <strong>Duke of Norfolk</strong> was arrested and later executed for treason in <strong>1572</strong> after his role in the Ridolfi Plot was uncovered.</p>

        <h3>Why Did Elizabeth Keep Mary Imprisoned for 19 Years?</h3>

        <p>Despite pressure from Parliament and advisors, Elizabeth refused to execute Mary for almost two decades:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Royal blood:</strong> Monarchs were appointed by God. Executing one could set a precedent that endangered Elizabeth herself.</li>
          <li><strong>Family ties:</strong> Mary was Elizabeth&rsquo;s cousin. Killing a relative would look barbaric.</li>
          <li><strong>International consequences:</strong> Mary&rsquo;s death could provoke war with France or Spain.</li>
          <li><strong>Lack of proof:</strong> For years, there was no clear evidence that Mary had personally approved any assassination plot.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="exam-tip">
        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>A common 8-mark question is: <em>&ldquo;What was important about the arrival of Mary, Queen of Scots in England in 1568?&rdquo;</em> Cover <strong>multiple factors</strong>: her claim to the throne, her Catholic faith, how she became a figurehead for plots (like the Northern Rebellion), and Elizabeth&rsquo;s impossible choice about what to do with her. Don&rsquo;t just describe events &mdash; explain <strong>why</strong> they mattered.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Mary was arguably the single greatest threat to Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign. Her claim to the throne, Catholic faith, and role as a figurehead for plots made her a constant danger. Keeping her alive was risky &mdash; but executing a fellow queen seemed unthinkable.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A dangerous rival:</strong> Mary had a legitimate claim many Catholics considered stronger than Elizabeth&rsquo;s. She had even claimed the title of Queen of England.</li>
          <li><strong>The Northern Rebellion (1569):</strong> A mix of religious, political, and economic causes. Nearly 5,000 rebels marched to free Mary and restore Catholicism. It was crushed, but proved the threat was real.</li>
          <li><strong>Elizabeth&rsquo;s dilemma:</strong> Every option had serious drawbacks. Imprisonment was &ldquo;the least worst option&rdquo; &mdash; but it made Mary a permanent magnet for plotters.</li>
        </ul>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: Mary\u2019s arrival was important because it created an impossible dilemma for Elizabeth that lasted 19 years. Mary had a strong blood claim to the English throne through Margaret Tudor, and many Catholics considered it stronger than Elizabeth\u2019s because the Pope never recognised Anne Boleyn\u2019s marriage. Her presence in England immediately made her a figurehead for Catholic opposition \u2014 within a year the Northern Rebellion erupted, with 5,000 rebels marching to free Mary and restore Catholicism. Elizabeth chose imprisonment as \u2018the least worst option,\u2019 but this turned Mary into a permanent magnet for plotters. Executing a fellow queen risked war with France and Spain, yet keeping her alive invited conspiracy.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: Mary\u2019s arrival was important because she had a strong claim to the throne and was Catholic, making her a rallying point for Elizabeth\u2019s enemies. Elizabeth had five options, but all were risky. She chose to imprison Mary, but this quickly triggered the Northern Rebellion of 1569, when nearly 5,000 rebels tried to free Mary and restore Catholicism. Mary\u2019s presence made Catholic plots a constant threat.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Mary\u2019s arrival was important because she was a Catholic with a claim to the throne. Elizabeth had to decide what to do with her, and chose to keep her prisoner for 19 years.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Mary was important because she was a threat to Elizabeth. / She was a Catholic who wanted the throne.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The Northern Rebellion was triggered by interconnected religious, political, and economic grievances. The Duke of Norfolk planned to marry Mary, Queen of Scots, which alarmed Elizabeth. When Norfolk was imprisoned and his supporters ordered to attend court, the Earls of Northumberland and Westmorland rebelled instead. The northern countryside still clung to Catholicism, and the rebels wanted to free Mary and restore the old religion. But the rebellion also reflected resentment at Elizabeth\u2019s Council of the North, which had taken power from traditional nobles, and economic losses \u2014 Northumberland had lost valuable copper mines. In November 1569, nearly 5,000 rebels marched south and forced their way into Durham Cathedral, holding a Catholic Mass and destroying Protestant prayer books. The rebellion failed because Mary was moved south, no foreign help arrived, and a royal army of 14,000 crushed the rising. Around 800 rebels were executed. Northumberland was later captured and beheaded in 1572.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: The Northern Rebellion began when the Duke of Norfolk planned to marry Mary, Queen of Scots. Elizabeth had Norfolk imprisoned, but the Earls of Northumberland and Westmorland rebelled. They wanted to restore Catholicism and free Mary. Nearly 5,000 rebels marched south and held a Catholic Mass in Durham Cathedral. The rebellion failed because Mary was moved further south and a royal army of 14,000 defeated them. Around 800 rebels were executed.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: The Northern Rebellion happened in 1569. The Earls of Northumberland and Westmorland rebelled because they wanted to free Mary, Queen of Scots and restore Catholicism. They marched south but were defeated by a large royal army.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: The Northern Rebellion was a Catholic rebellion in 1569. / Nobles rebelled against Elizabeth.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: Mary\u2019s claim was important because it was the foundation of every Catholic threat to Elizabeth\u2019s reign. As the granddaughter of Margaret Tudor, Mary had legitimate royal blood. Catholics considered her claim stronger than Elizabeth\u2019s because the Pope never recognised Henry VIII\u2019s marriage to Anne Boleyn, making Elizabeth illegitimate in Catholic eyes. Mary had even claimed the title of Queen of England while married to the French king. This meant she was not just a theoretical rival but an active one. Her claim directly inspired the Northern Rebellion of 1569, and later the Ridolfi, Throckmorton, and Babington plots. It also made her imprisonment necessary but her execution dangerous \u2014 killing a queen with royal blood could set a precedent and provoke war with Catholic France or Spain.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: Mary\u2019s claim was important because many Catholics believed she was the rightful Queen of England. She was the granddaughter of Margaret Tudor and the Pope had never recognised Anne Boleyn\u2019s marriage, making Elizabeth illegitimate in Catholic eyes. Mary had even claimed the English crown while married to the French king. This made her a focal point for plots and rebellions against Elizabeth.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Mary\u2019s claim was important because she had royal blood through Margaret Tudor.

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Mary\u2019s downfall in Scotland was caused by a chain of disastrous personal decisions. She had returned to Scotland in 1561 as a Catholic queen in an increasingly Protestant country, creating tension from the start. Her second husband Lord Darnley was murdered in 1567 in suspicious circumstances, and just three months later Mary married the Earl of Bothwell \u2014 the chief suspect in the murder. This outraged the Scottish nobles, who saw it as proof of her involvement. They rebelled, forcing Mary to abdicate in favour of her infant son James VI in July 1567. After escaping prison, she lost a final battle and fled across the border to England in May 1568, arriving at Carlisle Castle exhausted and in rough clothing. Her decision to seek Elizabeth\u2019s help placed an impossible burden on the English queen.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: Mary\u2019s time in Scotland was troubled.

After escaping prison, Mary lost a battle and fled to England in May 1568, hoping Elizabeth would help her regain her throne.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The Northern Rebellion\u2019s consequences were far-reaching and transformed Elizabeth\u2019s approach to Catholic threats. The immediate response was brutal \u2014 around 800 rebels were executed as a warning to deter future risings. The rebellion proved that Mary\u2019s presence in England was a genuine and active danger, not just a theoretical risk. The Duke of Norfolk was arrested and later executed for treason in 1572 after his involvement in the Ridolfi Plot was uncovered. The aftermath led to much tighter controls on Catholics, with increased surveillance and harsher penalties. Northumberland\u2019s capture and execution in 1572 \u2014 he refused to renounce his Catholic faith even to save his life \u2014 showed the depth of Catholic commitment. These events pushed Elizabeth\u2019s government towards the more repressive policies that would characterise the 1570s and 1580s.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: The Northern Rebellion had serious consequences. Elizabeth ordered around 800 rebels executed as a warning. The rebellion proved that Mary, Queen of Scots was a real threat \u2014 English Catholics were willing to take up arms for her. The Duke of Norfolk was later arrested and executed in 1572 for his role in the Ridolfi Plot. The government tightened controls on Catholics and became more suspicious of Mary.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: After the Northern Rebellion, about 800 rebels were executed. The rebellion showed that Mary, Queen of Scots was a real danger. The government became harsher towards Catholics.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence.

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: The decision to imprison Mary was important because it was \u2018the least worst option\u2019 but created a permanent problem. Executing Mary risked setting a precedent that anointed monarchs could be killed, potentially endangering Elizabeth herself. It could also provoke war with Catholic France or Spain. Releasing Mary was equally dangerous \u2014 she could flee to France and raise an invasion force, or return to Scotland and form an anti-English alliance. But keeping her alive in England made Mary a constant focal point for Catholic plotters. Over 19 years, this led directly to the Northern Rebellion, the Ridolfi Plot, the Throckmorton Plot, and finally the Babington Plot, which eventually forced Elizabeth\u2019s hand. The imprisonment was therefore both a solution and a cause of ongoing instability.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: Imprisoning Mary was important because it prevented her from fleeing abroad or rallying support in Scotland, but it also made her a permanent target for Catholic plotters. Elizabeth could not execute her because monarchs were appointed by God, and killing a queen could set a dangerous precedent. Mary\u2019s execution might also provoke war with France or Spain. For 19 years, Mary\u2019s existence in English prisons attracted conspiracy after conspiracy.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Imprisoning Mary was important because it kept her under control but also made her a target for Catholic plots. Elizabeth could not kill her because she was a queen and it might start a war.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding.
