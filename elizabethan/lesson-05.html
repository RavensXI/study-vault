        <h2>Mary, Queen of Scots</h2>

        <p>Mary, Queen of Scots was Elizabeth&rsquo;s Catholic cousin and one of the biggest threats to her reign. For <strong>19 years</strong> (1568&ndash;1587), Mary was held prisoner in England, becoming a constant focal point for Catholic plots.</p>

        <h3>Mary&rsquo;s Claim to the English Throne</h3>

        <p>Mary Stuart was the granddaughter of <strong>Margaret Tudor</strong>, Henry VIII&rsquo;s sister. This gave her a strong blood claim to the English throne. Many Catholics believed Mary&rsquo;s claim was <strong>stronger</strong> than Elizabeth&rsquo;s, because the Pope had never recognised Henry VIII&rsquo;s marriage to Anne Boleyn &mdash; making Elizabeth illegitimate in Catholic eyes. Mary had even <strong>claimed the title of Queen of England</strong> while married to the French king.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Mary&rsquo;s Background</div>
          <p>Mary became Queen of Scotland when she was just <strong>six days old</strong> in 1542. She was raised in France, married the French king (Francis II), and returned to Scotland as a widow in <strong>1561</strong>. She was Catholic in a country turning Protestant, which caused tension from the start.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mary&rsquo;s Downfall in Scotland</h3>

        <p>Mary&rsquo;s time as Queen of Scotland was troubled. Her second husband, <strong>Lord Darnley</strong>, was murdered in <strong>1567</strong> in suspicious circumstances. Just three months later, Mary married the <strong>Earl of Bothwell</strong> &mdash; the chief suspect in Darnley&rsquo;s murder. This outraged the Scottish nobles.</p>

        <p>The Scottish lords rebelled. Mary was forced to <dfn class="term" data-def="To formally give up the throne.">abdicate</dfn> in favour of her infant son, <strong>James VI</strong>, in July 1567. After escaping prison, she lost a final battle and fled across the border into <strong>England in May 1568</strong>. She arrived on the coast of north-west England, exhausted and in rough clothing, and was taken to <strong>Carlisle Castle</strong> where she demanded to see her cousin Elizabeth.</p>

        <h3>Elizabeth&rsquo;s Dilemma</h3>

        <p>Mary&rsquo;s arrival put Elizabeth in an impossible position. She had <strong>five options</strong>, and none were good:</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Elizabeth&rsquo;s five options</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>1. Help Mary regain the Scottish throne:</strong> Mary would be grateful, but English Protestants would hate fighting for a Catholic queen &mdash; and it could cause rebellion.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Let Mary travel to France:</strong> She had powerful Catholic connections there. The French or even the Spanish might give her an army to invade England.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Send Mary back to Scotland to stand trial:</strong> The Scots might kill her, and Elizabeth would be blamed for her death.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Execute Mary:</strong> Monarchs were chosen by God. Killing a queen would outrage rulers across Europe and set a dangerous precedent that could threaten Elizabeth herself.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Keep Mary prisoner in England:</strong> No quick decisions needed &mdash; but it looked bad to imprison royalty, it was expensive, and Mary would become a focal point for Catholic plotters.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Elizabeth chose <strong>option 5</strong> &mdash; what some historians have called <strong>&ldquo;the least worst option.&rdquo;</strong> Mary was kept in various English castles under guard for the next 19 years. Elizabeth refused to visit or release her, despite Mary&rsquo;s many moving letters to her cousin. But Mary&rsquo;s existence as a Catholic claimant made her a magnet for conspirators.</p>

        <h3>The Northern Rebellion, 1569</h3>

        <p>Mary&rsquo;s presence quickly triggered a crisis. The <strong>Duke of Norfolk</strong> &mdash; England&rsquo;s most powerful nobleman, who had royal blood and Catholic sympathies &mdash; planned to marry Mary. Elizabeth was furious. Norfolk was imprisoned, and his supporters were ordered to attend court. Instead, the Earls of <strong>Northumberland</strong> and <strong>Westmorland</strong> rebelled.</p>

        <p>The rebellion had a mix of <strong>religious, political, and economic</strong> causes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Religion:</strong> The northern countryside still clung to Catholic beliefs. The rebels wanted to restore Catholicism and free Mary.</li>
          <li><strong>Power:</strong> The <dfn class="term" data-def="A government body based in York that managed law and order in the north of England on behalf of the monarch.">Council of the North</dfn> had taken power from the traditional nobility. Elizabeth gave important jobs to men she could control directly, angering the old Earls.</li>
          <li><strong>Money:</strong> The Earls had lost land. Northumberland had lost valuable <strong>copper mines</strong>. They blamed Elizabeth&rsquo;s advisors &mdash; especially <strong>Robert Cecil</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In <strong>November 1569</strong>, nearly <strong>5,000 rebels</strong> marched south. They forced their way into <strong>Durham Cathedral</strong>, overturned the Protestant communion table, held a Catholic Mass, and destroyed Protestant prayer books. The rebels wore Catholic badges and carried Catholic banners.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why the Northern Rebellion Failed</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Mary was moved further south before the rebels could reach her</li>
            <li>No foreign help arrived &mdash; Spain and the Pope did not send support</li>
            <li>Many northern gentry refused to join</li>
            <li>A royal army of <strong>14,000 men</strong> was raised, far outnumbering the rebels</li>
            <li>Westmorland escaped and died in poverty in the Netherlands</li>
            <li>Northumberland was captured in <strong>1572</strong>. He was offered the chance to save his life by <strong>renouncing his Catholic beliefs</strong> &mdash; he refused and was beheaded</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Consequences of the Northern Rebellion</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s response was harsh. Around <strong>800 rebels</strong> were executed as a warning. The rebellion proved that Mary&rsquo;s presence in England was a genuine threat &mdash; and that some English Catholics were willing to take up arms.</p>

        <p>The aftermath led to tighter controls on Catholics and greater suspicion of Mary. The <strong>Duke of Norfolk</strong> was arrested and later executed for treason in <strong>1572</strong> after his role in the Ridolfi Plot was uncovered.</p>

        <h3>Why Did Elizabeth Keep Mary Imprisoned for 19 Years?</h3>

        <p>Despite pressure from Parliament and advisors, Elizabeth refused to execute Mary for almost two decades:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Royal blood:</strong> Monarchs were appointed by God. Executing one could set a precedent that endangered Elizabeth herself.</li>
          <li><strong>Family ties:</strong> Mary was Elizabeth&rsquo;s cousin. Killing a relative would look barbaric.</li>
          <li><strong>International consequences:</strong> Mary&rsquo;s death could provoke war with France or Spain.</li>
          <li><strong>Lack of proof:</strong> For years, there was no clear evidence that Mary had personally approved any assassination plot.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A common 8-mark question is: <em>&ldquo;What was important about the arrival of Mary, Queen of Scots in England in 1568?&rdquo;</em> Cover <strong>multiple factors</strong>: her claim to the throne, her Catholic faith, how she became a figurehead for plots (like the Northern Rebellion), and Elizabeth&rsquo;s impossible choice about what to do with her. Don&rsquo;t just describe events &mdash; explain <strong>why</strong> they mattered.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Mary was arguably the single greatest threat to Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign. Her claim to the throne, Catholic faith, and role as a figurehead for plots made her a constant danger. Keeping her alive was risky &mdash; but executing a fellow queen seemed unthinkable.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A dangerous rival:</strong> Mary had a legitimate claim many Catholics considered stronger than Elizabeth&rsquo;s. She had even claimed the title of Queen of England.</li>
          <li><strong>The Northern Rebellion (1569):</strong> A mix of religious, political, and economic causes. Nearly 5,000 rebels marched to free Mary and restore Catholicism. It was crushed, but proved the threat was real.</li>
          <li><strong>Elizabeth&rsquo;s dilemma:</strong> Every option had serious drawbacks. Imprisonment was &ldquo;the least worst option&rdquo; &mdash; but it made Mary a permanent magnet for plotters.</li>
        </ul>
