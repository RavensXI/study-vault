        <h2>Mary, Queen of Scots</h2>

        <p>Mary, Queen of Scots was Elizabeth&rsquo;s Catholic cousin and one of the biggest threats to her reign. For <strong>19 years</strong> (1568&ndash;1587), Mary was held prisoner in England, becoming a constant focal point for Catholic plots against Elizabeth. Understanding why Mary was so dangerous &mdash; and why Elizabeth could not simply get rid of her &mdash; is essential for this topic.</p>

        <h3>Mary&rsquo;s Claim to the English Throne</h3>

        <p>Mary Stuart was the granddaughter of <strong>Margaret Tudor</strong>, Henry VIII&rsquo;s sister. This gave her a strong blood claim to the English throne. In the eyes of many Catholics, Mary&rsquo;s claim was actually <strong>stronger</strong> than Elizabeth&rsquo;s, because they considered Elizabeth illegitimate &mdash; the Pope had never recognised Henry VIII&rsquo;s marriage to Anne Boleyn.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Mary&rsquo;s Background</div>
          <p>Mary became Queen of Scotland when she was just <strong>six days old</strong> in 1542. She was raised in France, married the French king (Francis II), and returned to Scotland as a widow in <strong>1561</strong>. She was Catholic in a country that was becoming increasingly Protestant, which created tensions from the start.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mary&rsquo;s Downfall in Scotland</h3>

        <p>Mary&rsquo;s time as Queen of Scotland was troubled. Her second husband, <strong>Lord Darnley</strong>, was murdered in <strong>1567</strong> in suspicious circumstances. Just three months later, Mary married the <strong>Earl of Bothwell</strong>, the chief suspect in Darnley&rsquo;s murder. This outraged the Scottish nobles and public.</p>

        <p>The Scottish lords rebelled against Mary. She was forced to abdicate (give up the throne) in favour of her infant son, <strong>James VI</strong>, in July 1567. After escaping prison, Mary lost a final battle against her enemies and fled across the border into <strong>England in May 1568</strong>, seeking Elizabeth&rsquo;s protection.</p>

        <h3>Elizabeth&rsquo;s Dilemma</h3>

        <p>Mary&rsquo;s arrival in England put Elizabeth in an impossible position. She had <strong>four options</strong>, and none of them were good:</p>

        <div class="collapsible">
          <button class="collapsible-toggle" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>Elizabeth&rsquo;s four options</span>
            <svg class="collapsible-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg>
          </button>
          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>1. Help Mary regain the Scottish throne:</strong> This would anger Scottish Protestants and could strengthen a Catholic rival.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Let Mary travel to France:</strong> Mary had powerful French Catholic connections. From France, she could raise an army and invade England.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Hand Mary back to the Scottish lords:</strong> They would almost certainly execute her. This would set a dangerous precedent &mdash; subjects killing a queen &mdash; which could threaten Elizabeth&rsquo;s own position.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Keep Mary prisoner in England:</strong> This would keep her under control but would make her a permanent focal point for Catholic plotters.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Elizabeth chose <strong>option 4</strong>. Mary was kept in various English castles and manor houses under guard for the next 19 years. Elizabeth hoped that by keeping Mary close, she could control the threat. But Mary&rsquo;s mere existence as a Catholic claimant made her a magnet for conspirators.</p>

        <h3>The Northern Rebellion, 1569</h3>

        <p>Mary&rsquo;s presence in England almost immediately triggered a crisis. In <strong>November 1569</strong>, the Catholic Earls of <strong>Northumberland</strong> and <strong>Westmorland</strong> led a rebellion in the north of England. Their aims were to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Free Mary, Queen of Scots from captivity</li>
          <li>Overthrow Elizabeth and restore Catholicism in England</li>
          <li>Marry Mary to the <strong>Duke of Norfolk</strong>, England&rsquo;s most senior nobleman</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Around <strong>4,600 rebels</strong> marched south, celebrating Catholic Mass in Durham Cathedral and tearing up the English Prayer Book. However, the rebellion ultimately failed for several reasons:</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why the Northern Rebellion Failed</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Mary was moved further south before the rebels could reach her</li>
            <li>The rebels lacked support from Spain or the Pope (no foreign help arrived)</li>
            <li>Many northern gentry refused to join the rebellion</li>
            <li>A royal army of <strong>14,000 men</strong> was raised, far outnumbering the rebels</li>
            <li>The Earl of Westmorland fled abroad; the Earl of Northumberland was captured and executed in <strong>1572</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Consequences of the Northern Rebellion</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s response was harsh. Around <strong>800 rebels</strong> were executed as a warning to others. The rebellion showed that Mary&rsquo;s presence in England was a genuine threat to Elizabeth&rsquo;s security. It also demonstrated that there were English Catholics willing to take up arms against the queen.</p>

        <p>The aftermath led to tighter controls on Catholics and increased suspicion of Mary. The <strong>Duke of Norfolk</strong> was arrested for his involvement and eventually executed for treason in <strong>1572</strong> after his role in the later Ridolfi Plot was uncovered.</p>

        <h3>Why Did Elizabeth Keep Mary Imprisoned for 19 Years?</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth refused to execute Mary for almost two decades, despite repeated pressure from Parliament and her advisors. There were several reasons:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Royal blood:</strong> Elizabeth believed that anointed monarchs should not be executed by their subjects. Setting this precedent could endanger her own life.</li>
          <li><strong>Family ties:</strong> Mary was Elizabeth&rsquo;s cousin. Executing a relative would look barbaric.</li>
          <li><strong>International consequences:</strong> Killing Mary could provoke war with France or Spain, who might use it as an excuse to invade.</li>
          <li><strong>Lack of proof:</strong> For many years, there was no clear, undeniable evidence that Mary had personally approved plots to assassinate Elizabeth.</li>
          <li><strong>Hope for a solution:</strong> Elizabeth hoped that Mary might be persuaded to give up her claim, or that the situation would resolve itself.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip-label">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>A common exam question asks you to explain why Mary, Queen of Scots was a threat to Elizabeth. Make sure you cover <strong>multiple factors</strong>: Mary&rsquo;s claim to the throne, her Catholic faith, her role as a figurehead for plots, and the support she received from foreign Catholic powers. Don&rsquo;t just describe events &mdash; explain <strong>why</strong> they were dangerous for Elizabeth&rsquo;s position.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Mary, Queen of Scots was arguably the single greatest threat to Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign. Her strong claim to the throne, her Catholic faith, and her willingness to be involved in plots made her a constant danger. Yet Elizabeth&rsquo;s reluctance to execute a fellow queen meant Mary remained a prisoner &mdash; and a focal point for conspiracy &mdash; for nearly two decades.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A dangerous rival:</strong> Mary had a legitimate claim to the English throne that many Catholics considered stronger than Elizabeth&rsquo;s.</li>
          <li><strong>The Northern Rebellion (1569):</strong> The first major crisis caused by Mary&rsquo;s presence, involving Catholic earls who aimed to free her and overthrow Elizabeth. It was crushed, but showed the real danger.</li>
          <li><strong>Elizabeth&rsquo;s dilemma:</strong> Keeping Mary alive was risky, but executing her was politically and morally unacceptable to Elizabeth for many years.</li>
          <li><strong>A catalyst for tighter security:</strong> Mary&rsquo;s imprisonment led to increased surveillance of Catholics and eventually to the spy network run by Walsingham.</li>
        </ul>
