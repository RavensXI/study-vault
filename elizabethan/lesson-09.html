        <h2>The Spanish Armada</h2>

        <p>In 1588, Philip II of Spain launched a huge fleet &mdash; the <strong>Spanish Armada</strong> &mdash; to invade England. Its defeat was a massive boost to English pride and cemented Elizabeth&rsquo;s reputation as a strong leader.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Armada in Numbers</div>
          <p>Spain sent around <strong>130 ships</strong> with roughly <strong>30,000 men</strong> on board, plus <strong>27,000 soldiers</strong> waiting in the Netherlands under the Duke of Parma. The plan was to sail up the English Channel, collect Parma&rsquo;s army, and invade England. Spain&rsquo;s annual income was around <strong>&pound;3 million</strong> &mdash; ten times England&rsquo;s <strong>&pound;300,000</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Why Did Philip II Launch the Armada?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Religion:</strong> Philip was a devout Catholic who wanted to overthrow Protestant Elizabeth and restore Catholicism. The Pope backed the invasion.</li>
          <li><strong>Political provocation:</strong> Elizabeth signed the Treaty of Nonsuch (1585), openly supporting Dutch rebels against Spain. Philip saw this as an act of war.</li>
          <li><strong>Drake&rsquo;s raid on Cadiz (1587):</strong> Drake destroyed around 30 ships and delayed the Armada by a year &mdash; &lsquo;singeing the King of Spain&rsquo;s beard.&rsquo;</li>
          <li><strong>Mary, Queen of Scots:</strong> Her execution (February 1587) removed Philip&rsquo;s hope of placing a Catholic queen on the throne through diplomacy. Invasion now seemed the only option.</li>
          <li><strong>English privateering:</strong> Drake and Hawkins had attacked Spanish treasure ships for years. Drake once stole <strong>&pound;30,000</strong> in a single raid (about &pound;15 million today).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Comparing the Two Sides</h3>

        <p>The English navy was led by <strong>Lord Howard of Effingham</strong>, with <strong>Drake</strong> and <strong>Hawkins</strong> as experienced vice-admirals. The Spanish Armada was commanded by the <strong>Duke of Medina Sidonia</strong>, who was chosen for his high rank &mdash; not his ability. He had no naval experience and reportedly suffered from seasickness.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>29 July 1588 &mdash; Sighting:</strong> The Armada was spotted off Cornwall. Beacons were lit along the south coast to raise the alarm.</p>
              <p><strong>31 July &ndash; 4 August &mdash; Channel battles:</strong> The English harassed the Armada as it sailed up the Channel in a defensive crescent. English ships used their speed and long-range guns, firing over <strong>2,000 cannonballs</strong> on the first day alone. But they could not break the Spanish formation.</p>
              <p><strong>6&ndash;7 August &mdash; Fireships at Calais:</strong> The Armada anchored near Calais to wait for Parma&rsquo;s army. At midnight, the English sent <strong>eight fire ships</strong> into the Spanish fleet. Panicking captains cut their anchor ropes and scattered, breaking the crescent.</p>
              <p><strong>8 August &mdash; Battle of Gravelines:</strong> The English attacked the scattered fleet at close range. Around <strong>600 Spaniards were killed</strong> and several ships were sunk or badly damaged. The wind pushed the survivors northwards, away from Parma&rsquo;s army.</p>
              <p><strong>August&ndash;September &mdash; The journey home:</strong> Unable to return through the Channel, the surviving ships sailed around Scotland and Ireland. Fierce storms forced many onto the rocks. Only about <strong>80 ships</strong> made it back to Spain. Around <strong>20,000 men died</strong> in total.</p>

        <h3>Why Was the Armada Defeated?</h3>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Reasons for Defeat</div>
          <p>The Armada&rsquo;s defeat had several causes. No single reason explains it &mdash; English tactics, ship design, Spanish mistakes, and the weather all played a part.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>English Tactics and Leadership</h4>
        <p>Howard, Drake, and Hawkins made smart tactical decisions. The <strong>fireships at Calais</strong> were the turning point, breaking the Spanish formation and causing chaos. English captains used their ships&rsquo; speed to stay at long range and batter the Spanish with cannon fire.</p>

        <h4>Ship Design and Technology</h4>
        <p>English galleons were built for speed. Spanish ships were slower and harder to steer. English cannons on rollers could be reloaded fast, while Spanish guns were slow and often had the wrong size ammunition.</p>

        <h4>Spanish Weaknesses and Mistakes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>Duke of Medina Sidonia</strong> had no naval experience and reportedly got seasick. He stopped more experienced officers from taking action.</li>
          <li>The plan relied on <strong>perfect coordination</strong> with Parma&rsquo;s army, but communication across hundreds of miles was slow and unreliable.</li>
          <li>Many Spanish cannons had the <strong>wrong size cannonballs</strong>, making them useless.</li>
          <li>Parma&rsquo;s army was blockaded by Dutch rebel ships and could not reach the Armada.</li>
          <li>The Spanish also <strong>missed a chance</strong> to destroy the English fleet while it was still in port.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Weather</h4>
        <p>The so-called <strong>&lsquo;Protestant Wind&rsquo;</strong> played a key role. Strong winds stopped the Spanish from regrouping after Gravelines, and storms around Scotland and Ireland wrecked many of the remaining ships. Elizabeth had a medal struck saying: <em>&ldquo;God blew and they were scattered.&rdquo;</em></p>

        <h3>The Significance of the Armada&rsquo;s Defeat</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>National pride:</strong> A huge boost to English confidence. Elizabeth&rsquo;s famous speech at Tilbury &mdash; &ldquo;I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king&rdquo; &mdash; became legendary.</li>
          <li><strong>Protestant England secured:</strong> The defeat ended any realistic chance of England being forced back to Catholicism by a foreign power.</li>
          <li><strong>Stricter laws against Catholics:</strong> Victory led to tougher anti-Catholic legislation in England.</li>
          <li><strong>Dutch independence:</strong> The northern Netherlands became independent from Spain, which helped English trade.</li>
          <li><strong>England as a naval power:</strong> The victory helped establish England as a serious sea power, laying the foundations for the later British Empire.</li>
          <li><strong>Propaganda:</strong> Elizabeth used the victory to strengthen her image as &lsquo;Gloriana&rsquo;, a monarch chosen by God.</li>
          <li><strong>War continued:</strong> The war with Spain lasted until 1604. Spain sent two more armadas (1596 and 1597), both wrecked by storms. The cost of the war led to <strong>higher taxes and inflation</strong> in England.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Do not just list reasons for the Armada&rsquo;s defeat &mdash; show how they <strong>connected</strong>. The fireships worked because the Spanish were waiting for Parma (a flaw in the plan). The weather then finished the job. The best answers show the <strong>interplay between factors</strong>, not just a list.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Armada&rsquo;s defeat in 1588 was a defining moment. English tactics (especially the Calais fireships), better ships, Spanish mistakes, and devastating weather all combined. Only about 80 of 130 ships returned to Spain, and around 20,000 men died. England remained Protestant, gained confidence as a naval power, and Elizabeth&rsquo;s reputation soared.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple causes of defeat:</strong> English tactics, faster ships, Spanish errors (wrong cannonballs, poor leadership, failed coordination with Parma), and the weather all played a part.</li>
          <li><strong>Fireships were the turning point:</strong> Breaking the Spanish crescent at Calais made English victory possible at Gravelines.</li>
          <li><strong>Huge significance:</strong> The victory secured Protestantism, boosted national pride, led to stricter Catholic laws, and helped England grow as a sea power.</li>
        </ul>
