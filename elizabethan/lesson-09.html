        <h2>The Spanish Armada</h2>

        <p>In 1588, Philip II of Spain launched a huge fleet &mdash; the <strong>Spanish Armada</strong> &mdash; to invade England. Its defeat was a massive boost to English pride and cemented Elizabeth&rsquo;s reputation as a strong leader.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; The Armada in Numbers</div>
          <p>Spain sent around <strong>130 ships</strong> with roughly <strong>30,000 men</strong> on board, plus <strong>27,000 soldiers</strong> waiting in the Netherlands under the Duke of Parma. The plan was to sail up the English Channel, collect Parma&rsquo;s army, and invade England. Spain&rsquo;s annual income was around <strong>&pound;3 million</strong> &mdash; ten times England&rsquo;s <strong>&pound;300,000</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Why Did Philip II Launch the Armada?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Religion:</strong> Philip was a devout Catholic who wanted to overthrow Protestant Elizabeth and restore Catholicism. The Pope backed the invasion.</li>
          <li><strong>Political provocation:</strong> Elizabeth signed the Treaty of Nonsuch (1585), openly supporting Dutch rebels against Spain. Philip saw this as an act of war.</li>
          <li><strong>Drake&rsquo;s raid on Cadiz (1587):</strong> Drake destroyed around 30 ships and delayed the Armada by a year &mdash; &lsquo;singeing the King of Spain&rsquo;s beard.&rsquo;</li>
          <li><strong>Mary, Queen of Scots:</strong> Her execution (February 1587) removed Philip&rsquo;s hope of placing a Catholic queen on the throne through diplomacy. Invasion now seemed the only option.</li>
          <li><strong>English privateering:</strong> Drake and Hawkins had attacked Spanish treasure ships for years. Drake once stole <strong>&pound;30,000</strong> in a single raid (about &pound;15 million today).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Comparing the Two Sides</h3>

        <p>The English navy was led by <strong>Lord Howard of Effingham</strong>, with <strong>Drake</strong> and <strong>Hawkins</strong> as experienced vice-admirals. The Spanish Armada was commanded by the <strong>Duke of Medina Sidonia</strong>, who was chosen for his high rank &mdash; not his ability. He had no naval experience and reportedly suffered from seasickness.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>29 July 1588 &mdash; Sighting:</strong> The Armada was spotted off Cornwall. Beacons were lit along the south coast to raise the alarm.</p>
              <p><strong>31 July &ndash; 4 August &mdash; Channel battles:</strong> The English harassed the Armada as it sailed up the Channel in a defensive crescent. English ships used their speed and long-range guns, firing over <strong>2,000 cannonballs</strong> on the first day alone. But they could not break the Spanish formation.</p>
              <p><strong>6&ndash;7 August &mdash; Fireships at Calais:</strong> The Armada anchored near Calais to wait for Parma&rsquo;s army. At midnight, the English sent <strong>eight fire ships</strong> into the Spanish fleet. Panicking captains cut their anchor ropes and scattered, breaking the crescent.</p>
              <p><strong>8 August &mdash; Battle of Gravelines:</strong> The English attacked the scattered fleet at close range. Around <strong>600 Spaniards were killed</strong> and several ships were sunk or badly damaged. The wind pushed the survivors northwards, away from Parma&rsquo;s army.</p>
              <p><strong>August&ndash;September &mdash; The journey home:</strong> Unable to return through the Channel, the surviving ships sailed around Scotland and Ireland. Fierce storms forced many onto the rocks. Only about <strong>80 ships</strong> made it back to Spain. Around <strong>20,000 men died</strong> in total.</p>

        <h3>Why Was the Armada Defeated?</h3>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Reasons for Defeat</div>
          <p>The Armada&rsquo;s defeat had several causes. No single reason explains it &mdash; English tactics, ship design, Spanish mistakes, and the weather all played a part.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>English Tactics and Leadership</h4>
        <p>Howard, Drake, and Hawkins made smart tactical decisions. The <strong>fireships at Calais</strong> were the turning point, breaking the Spanish formation and causing chaos. English captains used their ships&rsquo; speed to stay at long range and batter the Spanish with cannon fire.</p>

        <h4>Ship Design and Technology</h4>
        <p>English galleons were built for speed. Spanish ships were slower and harder to steer. English cannons on rollers could be reloaded fast, while Spanish guns were slow and often had the wrong size ammunition.</p>

        <h4>Spanish Weaknesses and Mistakes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>Duke of Medina Sidonia</strong> had no naval experience and reportedly got seasick. He stopped more experienced officers from taking action.</li>
          <li>The plan relied on <strong>perfect coordination</strong> with Parma&rsquo;s army, but communication across hundreds of miles was slow and unreliable.</li>
          <li>Many Spanish cannons had the <strong>wrong size cannonballs</strong>, making them useless.</li>
          <li>Parma&rsquo;s army was blockaded by Dutch rebel ships and could not reach the Armada.</li>
          <li>The Spanish also <strong>missed a chance</strong> to destroy the English fleet while it was still in port.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Weather</h4>
        <p>The so-called <strong>&lsquo;Protestant Wind&rsquo;</strong> played a key role. Strong winds stopped the Spanish from regrouping after Gravelines, and storms around Scotland and Ireland wrecked many of the remaining ships. Elizabeth had a medal struck saying: <em>&ldquo;God blew and they were scattered.&rdquo;</em></p>

        <h3>The Significance of the Armada&rsquo;s Defeat</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>National pride:</strong> A huge boost to English confidence. Elizabeth&rsquo;s famous speech at Tilbury &mdash; &ldquo;I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king&rdquo; &mdash; became legendary.</li>
          <li><strong>Protestant England secured:</strong> The defeat ended any realistic chance of England being forced back to Catholicism by a foreign power.</li>
          <li><strong>Stricter laws against Catholics:</strong> Victory led to tougher anti-Catholic legislation in England.</li>
          <li><strong>Dutch independence:</strong> The northern Netherlands became independent from Spain, which helped English trade.</li>
          <li><strong>England as a naval power:</strong> The victory helped establish England as a serious sea power, laying the foundations for the later British Empire.</li>
          <li><strong>Propaganda:</strong> Elizabeth used the victory to strengthen her image as &lsquo;Gloriana&rsquo;, a monarch chosen by God.</li>
          <li><strong>War continued:</strong> The war with Spain lasted until 1604. Spain sent two more armadas (1596 and 1597), both wrecked by storms. The cost of the war led to <strong>higher taxes and inflation</strong> in England.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Do not just list reasons for the Armada&rsquo;s defeat &mdash; show how they <strong>connected</strong>. The fireships worked because the Spanish were waiting for Parma (a flaw in the plan). The weather then finished the job. The best answers show the <strong>interplay between factors</strong>, not just a list.</p>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Armada&rsquo;s defeat in 1588 was a defining moment. English tactics (especially the Calais fireships), better ships, Spanish mistakes, and devastating weather all combined. Only about 80 of 130 ships returned to Spain, and around 20,000 men died. England remained Protestant, gained confidence as a naval power, and Elizabeth&rsquo;s reputation soared.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple causes of defeat:</strong> English tactics, faster ships, Spanish errors (wrong cannonballs, poor leadership, failed coordination with Parma), and the weather all played a part.</li>
          <li><strong>Fireships were the turning point:</strong> Breaking the Spanish crescent at Calais made English victory possible at Gravelines.</li>
          <li><strong>Huge significance:</strong> The victory secured Protestantism, boosted national pride, led to stricter Catholic laws, and helped England grow as a sea power.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: A complex account might trace the campaign from the Channel battles (31 July \u2013 4 August), where English ships used their speed and long-range guns to harass the Armada\u2019s defensive crescent, through the fireships at Calais (6\u20137 August), which caused panicking captains to cut anchor ropes and scatter the formation. At the Battle of Gravelines (8 August), the English attacked at close range, killing around 600 Spaniards and sinking several ships. The wind then pushed survivors northwards, away from Parma\u2019s army. The return journey around Scotland and Ireland was devastating \u2014 storms wrecked many ships, and only about 80 of the original 130 returned to Spain. Around 20,000 men died in total. The account might link English tactics, ship design (faster galleons with cannons on rollers), Spanish weaknesses (Medina Sidonia\u2019s inexperience, wrong-size cannonballs, Parma blockaded by Dutch rebels), and the weather into a coherent narrative.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: A developed account might explain the fireships at Calais (breaking the crescent) and the Battle of Gravelines (close-range attack), then describe how storms around Scotland and Ireland destroyed much of the remaining fleet.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: A simple account might describe the fireships and the storms, noting that many Spanish ships were destroyed.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: England beat the Armada using fireships and bad weather.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain the defeat\u2019s significance across multiple areas: it was a huge boost to national pride (Elizabeth\u2019s Tilbury speech became legendary), it secured Protestant England (ending any realistic chance of a foreign power forcing England back to Catholicism), and it established England as a serious naval power (laying foundations for the later British Empire). Elizabeth used the victory as propaganda to strengthen her image as \u2018Gloriana,\u2019 a monarch chosen by God. However, the war continued until 1604 \u2014 Spain sent two more armadas (1596 and 1597, both wrecked by storms) \u2014 and the cost of war led to higher taxes and inflation. The victory also led to stricter anti-Catholic laws and helped Dutch independence, which benefited English trade.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: A developed answer might explain that the defeat boosted national pride and Elizabeth\u2019s reputation (Tilbury speech), and that it secured Protestantism and established England as a naval power.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The defeat was important because it showed England could beat a much larger power and made people proud.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Beating the Armada was important because it saved England.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: A complex account might trace the build-up of causes: religious differences (Philip was a devout Catholic who wanted to restore Catholicism; the Pope backed the invasion), political provocation (Elizabeth signed the Treaty of Nonsuch in 1585, openly sending 7,000 troops to support Dutch rebels), Drake\u2019s privateering (stealing \u00a330,000 in one raid; raiding Cadiz in 1587 and destroying 30 ships), and Mary\u2019s execution (February 1587, which removed Philip\u2019s hope of placing a Catholic queen on the throne through diplomacy). The account might show how these causes built on each other over nearly 30 years and explain why invasion seemed the only option left to Philip.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: A developed account might explain two or three causes in detail, such as English support for Dutch rebels (Treaty of Nonsuch) and Drake\u2019s raids, showing how they provoked Philip.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: A simple account might describe how religion and English attacks on Spanish ships made Philip want to invade.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: Philip launched the Armada because he was angry with Elizabeth.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain that English naval tactics were crucial at every stage. Howard, Drake, and Hawkins used their ships\u2019 superior speed and long-range guns to harass the Spanish crescent in the Channel (firing over 2,000 cannonballs on the first day). The fireships at Calais were the turning point \u2014 eight ships sent at midnight caused panicking captains to cut anchor ropes and scatter. This broke the defensive crescent formation, allowing the English to attack at close range at Gravelines. English cannons on rollers could be reloaded fast, while Spanish guns were slow. The tactics worked because of ship design \u2014 English galleons were smaller and faster, built for speed rather than boarding. However, tactics alone did not win \u2014 they combined with Spanish weaknesses (Medina Sidonia\u2019s inexperience, wrong-size cannonballs, Parma blockaded) and devastating weather.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: A developed answer might explain the fireships at Calais (breaking the formation) and the Battle of Gravelines (close-range attack exploiting faster English ships with cannons on rollers).\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: English tactics were important because the fireships at Calais scattered the Spanish fleet, making it easier to attack.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: English ships were faster and used clever tactics.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: A complex account might trace multiple Spanish weaknesses and show how they connected. The Duke of Medina Sidonia had no naval experience and reportedly suffered from seasickness \u2014 he was chosen for his rank, not ability, and he stopped more experienced officers from taking action. The plan relied on perfect coordination with Parma\u2019s 27,000 soldiers in the Netherlands, but communication was slow and Parma was blockaded by Dutch rebel ships. Many Spanish cannons had the wrong size cannonballs, making them useless. The Spanish also missed a chance to destroy the English fleet while it was still in port. Spanish ships were larger but slower and harder to steer than English galleons. After the fireships scattered the fleet at Calais, these weaknesses were exposed \u2014 the slow ships could not reform, and the inadequate guns could not match English firepower at Gravelines.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: A developed account might explain Medina Sidonia\u2019s inexperience and the failure to coordinate with Parma (blockaded by Dutch ships), showing how these flaws made defeat more likely.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: A simple account might describe how the Spanish commander was inexperienced and the ships had wrong-size cannonballs.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: The Spanish made mistakes and had a bad leader.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: A complex answer might explain that the so-called \u2018Protestant Wind\u2019 played a key role at several stages. After the Battle of Gravelines, strong winds pushed the surviving Spanish ships northwards, away from Parma\u2019s army, making it impossible to regroup or attempt the invasion. On the return journey around Scotland and Ireland, fierce storms forced many ships onto the rocks. Only about 80 of the original 130 ships returned to Spain, and around 20,000 men died in total. Elizabeth had a medal struck saying \u2018God blew and they were scattered.\u2019 The weather was important because it turned a tactical setback into a catastrophic defeat. However, the weather only finished what English tactics had started \u2014 the fireships at Calais had already broken the crescent and the Battle of Gravelines had damaged the fleet. Without the earlier English successes, the weather alone might not have been decisive.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: A developed answer might explain that storms around Scotland and Ireland wrecked many ships (only 80 of 130 returned), and that the wind after Gravelines prevented the Spanish from regrouping \u2014 but also note that this built on the damage from English tactics.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Weather was important because storms destroyed many Spanish ships on the way home, with only about 80 out of 130 surviving.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Bad weather helped destroy the Armada.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."
