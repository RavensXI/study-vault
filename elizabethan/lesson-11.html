        <h2>Elizabethan Exploration</h2>

        <p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign saw a huge expansion in English seafaring. Driven by wealth, rivalry with Spain, religion, and adventure, English &lsquo;sea dogs&rsquo; ventured further than ever before. These voyages laid the foundations for the future British Empire &mdash; but also marked the start of English involvement in the slave trade.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why Explore?</div>
          <p>Elizabethan exploration was driven by several motives:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wealth and trade</strong> &mdash; gold, silver, spices, silk, and new markets</li>
            <li><strong>Challenging Spain</strong> &mdash; privateering and breaking Spain&rsquo;s <dfn class="term" data-def="Exclusive control over trade in a particular area.">monopoly</dfn> on New World riches</li>
            <li><strong>Religion</strong> &mdash; spreading Protestantism; Elizabethans felt it was their duty to spread God&rsquo;s word, especially as Spain had spread Catholicism in South America</li>
            <li><strong>Collapse of the wool trade</strong> &mdash; demand for English wool fell, so merchants looked for new goods to trade</li>
            <li><strong>Adventure</strong> &mdash; English seamen grew up near the sea and had experience as merchants or smugglers. Captains like Drake inspired loyalty.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>What Made Exploration Possible?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Better ships:</strong> New designs had <strong>triangular sails</strong> that could be turned quickly to catch the wind, plus improved rudders for better steering. Ships were faster and could carry more supplies.</li>
          <li><strong>Rapid-fire cannons:</strong> English ships could outgun and capture Spanish treasure ships.</li>
          <li><strong>Improved navigation:</strong> The <dfn class="term" data-def="An instrument used to measure latitude by sighting the angle between the horizon and the North Star.">astrolabe</dfn> measured how far north a ship was. The <strong>magnetic compass</strong> measured east&ndash;west position. Better maps &mdash; especially Mercator&rsquo;s world map of 1569 &mdash; gave a clearer picture of the world. The <strong>printing press</strong> made maps and charts widely available.</li>
          <li><strong>Royal support:</strong> Elizabeth encouraged and sometimes secretly funded voyages, especially those targeting Spanish interests.</li>
          <li><strong>Privateering licences:</strong> The Queen granted &lsquo;letters of marque&rsquo; allowing English captains to legally attack enemy ships and keep a share of the plunder.</li>
          <li><strong>Geographical advantage:</strong> England&rsquo;s position on the edge of Europe gave it good access to the Atlantic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Explorers and Their Voyages</h3>

        <h4>Sir John Hawkins</h4>
        <p>Hawkins was one of the first English sailors involved in the <strong>transatlantic slave trade</strong>. In <strong>1564</strong>, he captured a Spanish ship and sold the enslaved people on board for a huge profit. Soon, Hawkins and others were travelling to West Africa and transporting enslaved people across the Atlantic to the New World. These voyages were highly profitable but illegal under Spanish law. In <strong>1568</strong>, Hawkins&rsquo;s fleet was attacked by the Spanish at <strong>San Juan de Ul&uacute;a</strong> in Mexico, deepening English hostility towards Spain. Hawkins later became Treasurer of the Navy and modernised the English fleet before the Armada.</p>

        <h4>Sir Francis Drake</h4>
        <p>Drake was the most famous English explorer and privateer. He hated Spain (after San Juan de Ul&uacute;a) and craved wealth and adventure.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Circumnavigation of the globe (1577&ndash;1580):</strong> Drake set out with <strong>5 ships and 164 men</strong>. He became the first Englishman to sail through the dangerous Straits of Magellan into the Pacific. He raided Spanish ports as far as California (which he claimed as &lsquo;New Albion&rsquo;). He returned after 3 years with just <strong>1 ship and 58 men</strong> &mdash; but a fortune in gold. Drake gave half his treasure to Elizabeth. This was equal to the <strong>entire royal income of the previous year</strong>. Elizabeth knighted him aboard the <em>Golden Hind</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Raid on Cadiz (1587):</strong> Drake destroyed around 30 Spanish ships, delaying the Armada by a year (&lsquo;singeing the King of Spain&rsquo;s beard&rsquo;).</li>
          <li><strong>The Spanish Armada (1588):</strong> Drake served as vice-admiral of the English fleet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Sir Walter Raleigh</h4>
        <p>Raleigh was a courtier, soldier, and explorer. In <strong>1584</strong>, he persuaded Elizabeth to let him explore the east coast of North America, which he named <strong>Virginia</strong> in the Queen&rsquo;s honour. Elizabeth gave Raleigh exclusive rights to the land and resources there.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Roanoke &mdash; First Colony (1585):</strong> Raleigh organised and financed the voyage but was ordered to stay in England as one of Elizabeth&rsquo;s favourites. The first colony failed and was abandoned.</li>
          <li><strong>Roanoke &mdash; Second Colony (1587):</strong> A second attempt became the <strong>&lsquo;Lost Colony&rsquo;</strong>. When supply ships returned in 1590, all the colonists had vanished. The only clue was the word &lsquo;CROATOAN&rsquo; carved into a tree &mdash; the name of a local Native American tribe. Historians think the colonists either starved, were killed, or were absorbed into the tribe.</li>
          <li><strong>New goods:</strong> Raleigh is often credited with bringing tobacco and potatoes to England, though he was not the first to do so.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Trade Companies</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth allowed companies to be formed with a <dfn class="term" data-def="Exclusive control over trade in a particular area.">monopoly</dfn> of trade in certain regions. These were an important source of royal income:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Muscovy Company</strong> &mdash; traded timber and furs from Russia</li>
          <li><strong>The Levant Company</strong> &mdash; traded spices and dyes from Turkey</li>
          <li><strong>The East India Company (1600)</strong> &mdash; traded spices, silks, and tea with India. It later became so powerful that it conquered the whole of India.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Did These Voyages Achieve?</h3>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Increased wealth:</strong> Privateering and trade brought huge profits. Drake&rsquo;s circumnavigation alone brought back treasure equal to the entire royal income.</p>
              <p><strong>New knowledge:</strong> Voyages mapped new lands and seas, improving geography and navigation. Drake&rsquo;s route inspired other explorers and improved maps.</p>
              <p><strong>Challenging Spain:</strong> English exploration directly challenged Spain&rsquo;s dominance of the oceans and the New World, fuelling the rivalry that led to the Armada.</p>
              <p><strong>Growing naval power:</strong> English seamanship improved through these voyages. This was vital in defeating the Armada in 1588 and helped establish England as a naval power.</p>
              <p><strong>Foundation of empire:</strong> Roanoke failed, but a successful colony at <strong>Jamestown</strong> was established under James I in 1607. This is seen as the start of building the British Empire.</p>
              <p><strong>National pride:</strong> The exploits of Drake, Hawkins, and Raleigh boosted national pride and contributed to the idea of a &lsquo;Golden Age&rsquo;.</p>
              <p><strong>The slave trade:</strong> A darker legacy &mdash; Hawkins&rsquo;s voyages marked the start of English involvement in the slave trade, which caused immense suffering over the next three centuries.</p>

        <p>A common question is: <strong>&ldquo;Write an account of the ways in which the voyages of discovery affected Elizabethan England.&rdquo;</strong> For top marks, cover both <strong>short-term effects</strong> (wealth from treasure, new trade goods) and <strong>long-term effects</strong> (growing naval power, the start of empire-building, the slave trade). Link motives to outcomes and show you understand why these voyages mattered.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Elizabethan exploration was driven by wealth, rivalry with Spain, religion, technology, and adventure. Drake, Hawkins, and Raleigh brought treasure, knowledge, and prestige to England &mdash; but also started the English slave trade. Roanoke failed, but Jamestown (1607) would follow. The voyages grew English naval power, helped defeat the Armada, and laid the foundations for a global empire.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple motives drove exploration:</strong> Wealth, religion, rivalry with Spain, collapsing wool trade, and improved technology all pushed English sailors to venture further.</li>
          <li><strong>Drake&rsquo;s circumnavigation was a turning point:</strong> It brought a fortune to England, challenged Spain, and inspired future voyages.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term effects were huge:</strong> Growing naval power helped beat the Armada. Trade companies brought new wealth. Roanoke paved the way for later colonies and the British Empire &mdash; but the slave trade was a lasting dark legacy.</li>
        </ul>
