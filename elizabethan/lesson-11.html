        <h2>Elizabethan Exploration</h2>

        <p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign saw a huge expansion in English seafaring. Driven by wealth, rivalry with Spain, religion, and adventure, English &lsquo;sea dogs&rsquo; ventured further than ever before. These voyages laid the foundations for the future British Empire &mdash; but also marked the start of English involvement in the slave trade.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
          <div class="key-fact-label">Key Fact &mdash; Why Explore?</div>
          <p>Elizabethan exploration was driven by several motives:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wealth and trade</strong> &mdash; gold, silver, spices, silk, and new markets</li>
            <li><strong>Challenging Spain</strong> &mdash; privateering and breaking Spain&rsquo;s <dfn class="term" data-def="Exclusive control over trade in a particular area.">monopoly</dfn> on New World riches</li>
            <li><strong>Religion</strong> &mdash; spreading Protestantism; Elizabethans felt it was their duty to spread God&rsquo;s word, especially as Spain had spread Catholicism in South America</li>
            <li><strong>Collapse of the wool trade</strong> &mdash; demand for English wool fell, so merchants looked for new goods to trade</li>
            <li><strong>Adventure</strong> &mdash; English seamen grew up near the sea and had experience as merchants or smugglers. Captains like Drake inspired loyalty.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>What Made Exploration Possible?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Better ships:</strong> New designs had <strong>triangular sails</strong> that could be turned quickly to catch the wind, plus improved rudders for better steering. Ships were faster and could carry more supplies.</li>
          <li><strong>Rapid-fire cannons:</strong> English ships could outgun and capture Spanish treasure ships.</li>
          <li><strong>Improved navigation:</strong> The <dfn class="term" data-def="An instrument used to measure latitude by sighting the angle between the horizon and the North Star.">astrolabe</dfn> measured how far north a ship was. The <strong>magnetic compass</strong> measured east&ndash;west position. Better maps &mdash; especially Mercator&rsquo;s world map of 1569 &mdash; gave a clearer picture of the world. The <strong>printing press</strong> made maps and charts widely available.</li>
          <li><strong>Royal support:</strong> Elizabeth encouraged and sometimes secretly funded voyages, especially those targeting Spanish interests.</li>
          <li><strong>Privateering licences:</strong> The Queen granted &lsquo;letters of marque&rsquo; allowing English captains to legally attack enemy ships and keep a share of the plunder.</li>
          <li><strong>Geographical advantage:</strong> England&rsquo;s position on the edge of Europe gave it good access to the Atlantic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Explorers and Their Voyages</h3>

        <h4>Sir John Hawkins</h4>
        <p>Hawkins was one of the first English sailors involved in the <strong>transatlantic slave trade</strong>. In <strong>1564</strong>, he captured a Spanish ship and sold the enslaved people on board for a huge profit. Soon, Hawkins and others were travelling to West Africa and transporting enslaved people across the Atlantic to the New World. These voyages were highly profitable but illegal under Spanish law. In <strong>1568</strong>, Hawkins&rsquo;s fleet was attacked by the Spanish at <strong>San Juan de Ul&uacute;a</strong> in Mexico, deepening English hostility towards Spain. Hawkins later became Treasurer of the Navy and modernised the English fleet before the Armada.</p>

        <h4>Sir Francis Drake</h4>
        <p>Drake was the most famous English explorer and privateer. He hated Spain (after San Juan de Ul&uacute;a) and craved wealth and adventure.</p>

        <figure class="diagram">
          <img src="diagram_drake_voyage.png" alt="Map showing Drake's circumnavigation route (1577-1580): Plymouth to Straits of Magellan, up the Pacific coast raiding Spanish ports, to California, across the Pacific, and home — starting with 5 ships and 164 men, returning with 1 ship, 58 men, and a fortune in gold">
        </figure>

        <p>Drake also led the <strong>raid on Cadiz (1587)</strong>, destroying around 30 Spanish ships and delaying the Armada by a year. He served as <strong>vice-admiral</strong> of the English fleet during the Armada in 1588.</p>

        <h4>Sir Walter Raleigh</h4>
        <p>Raleigh was a courtier, soldier, and explorer. In <strong>1584</strong>, he persuaded Elizabeth to let him explore the east coast of North America, which he named <strong>Virginia</strong> in the Queen&rsquo;s honour. Elizabeth gave Raleigh exclusive rights to the land and resources there.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Roanoke &mdash; First Colony (1585):</strong> Raleigh organised and financed the voyage but was ordered to stay in England as one of Elizabeth&rsquo;s favourites. The first colony failed and was abandoned.</li>
          <li><strong>Roanoke &mdash; Second Colony (1587):</strong> A second attempt became the <strong>&lsquo;Lost Colony&rsquo;</strong>. When supply ships returned in 1590, all the colonists had vanished. The only clue was the word &lsquo;CROATOAN&rsquo; carved into a tree &mdash; the name of a local Native American tribe. Historians think the colonists either starved, were killed, or were absorbed into the tribe.</li>
          <li><strong>New goods:</strong> Raleigh is often credited with bringing tobacco and potatoes to England, though he was not the first to do so.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Trade Companies</h3>

        <p>Elizabeth allowed companies to be formed with a <dfn class="term" data-def="Exclusive control over trade in a particular area.">monopoly</dfn> of trade in certain regions. These were an important source of royal income:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Muscovy Company</strong> &mdash; traded timber and furs from Russia</li>
          <li><strong>The Levant Company</strong> &mdash; traded spices and dyes from Turkey</li>
          <li><strong>The East India Company (1600)</strong> &mdash; traded spices, silks, and tea with India. It later became so powerful that it conquered the whole of India.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Did These Voyages Achieve?</h3>

            <span>Achievements and consequences in detail</span>

          <div class="collapsible-content">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
              <p><strong>Increased wealth:</strong> Privateering and trade brought huge profits. Drake&rsquo;s circumnavigation alone brought back treasure equal to the entire royal income.</p>
              <p><strong>New knowledge:</strong> Voyages mapped new lands and seas, improving geography and navigation. Drake&rsquo;s route inspired other explorers and improved maps.</p>
              <p><strong>Challenging Spain:</strong> English exploration directly challenged Spain&rsquo;s dominance of the oceans and the New World, fuelling the rivalry that led to the Armada.</p>
              <p><strong>Growing naval power:</strong> English seamanship improved through these voyages. This was vital in defeating the Armada in 1588 and helped establish England as a naval power.</p>
              <p><strong>Foundation of empire:</strong> Roanoke failed, but a successful colony at <strong>Jamestown</strong> was established under James I in 1607. This is seen as the start of building the British Empire.</p>
              <p><strong>National pride:</strong> The exploits of Drake, Hawkins, and Raleigh boosted national pride and contributed to the idea of a &lsquo;Golden Age&rsquo;.</p>
              <p><strong>The slave trade:</strong> A darker legacy &mdash; Hawkins&rsquo;s voyages marked the start of English involvement in the slave trade, which caused immense suffering over the next three centuries.</p>

        <p>A common question is: <strong>&ldquo;Write an account of the ways in which the voyages of discovery affected Elizabethan England.&rdquo;</strong> For top marks, cover both <strong>short-term effects</strong> (wealth from treasure, new trade goods) and <strong>long-term effects</strong> (growing naval power, the start of empire-building, the slave trade). Link motives to outcomes and show you understand why these voyages mattered.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Elizabethan exploration was driven by wealth, rivalry with Spain, religion, technology, and adventure. Drake, Hawkins, and Raleigh brought treasure, knowledge, and prestige to England &mdash; but also started the English slave trade. Roanoke failed, but Jamestown (1607) would follow. The voyages grew English naval power, helped defeat the Armada, and laid the foundations for a global empire.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple motives drove exploration:</strong> Wealth, religion, rivalry with Spain, collapsing wool trade, and improved technology all pushed English sailors to venture further.</li>
          <li><strong>Drake&rsquo;s circumnavigation was a turning point:</strong> It brought a fortune to England, challenged Spain, and inspired future voyages.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term effects were huge:</strong> Growing naval power helped beat the Armada. Trade companies brought new wealth. Roanoke paved the way for later colonies and the British Empire &mdash; but the slave trade was a lasting dark legacy.</li>

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: New technology was important because it made long-distance ocean voyages possible for the first time. The astrolabe and magnetic compass allowed sailors to navigate far from coastlines. Triangular lateen sails improved manoeuvrability, and Mercator\u2019s world map of 1569 gave navigators a more accurate picture of the globe. These advances worked together \u2014 improved navigation combined with faster ship designs meant Drake could complete his circumnavigation (1577\u20131580), which would have been impossible a generation earlier. Crucially, the same technology that enabled exploration also gave England a military edge: Hawkins redesigned English warships to be faster and carry long-range cannons, which proved decisive against the Armada in 1588. Technology therefore connected exploration to national defence.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: New technology was important because the astrolabe and compass helped sailors navigate on long voyages. Mercator\u2019s map of 1569 improved geographical knowledge. Hawkins redesigned English ships to be faster, which helped both explorers and the navy that fought the Armada.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: New technology was important because better navigation tools like the astrolabe helped sailors find their way on long voyages.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Better ships and maps helped Elizabethan sailors explore.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: The voyages were important in both the short and long term. In the short term, Drake\u2019s circumnavigation (1577\u20131580) brought back treasure equal to the entire royal income, directly challenging Spain\u2019s monopoly on New World wealth. This fuelled the rivalry that led to the Armada. In the longer term, voyages improved navigation and seamanship, which proved vital when the English fleet defeated the Armada in 1588. Trade companies like the East India Company (1600) opened new markets. Raleigh\u2019s failed colony at Roanoke paved the way for Jamestown in 1607 and the future British Empire \u2014 though Hawkins\u2019s involvement in the slave trade from 1564 was a darker legacy.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: The voyages were important because they brought great wealth to England. Drake captured Spanish treasure worth a fortune, and privateering was encouraged by Elizabeth through letters of marque. They were also important because they challenged Spain\u2019s dominance of the oceans, increasing tensions that led to the Armada in 1588.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: The voyages were important because they helped establish England as a naval power. Explorers like Drake and Hawkins improved English seamanship and brought back wealth from attacking Spanish ships.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Explorers like Drake sailed around the world and brought back treasure.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Drake\u2019s circumnavigation (1577\u20131580) had far-reaching effects. He set out with 5 ships and 164 men, returning with just 1 ship and 58 men but carrying a fortune in captured Spanish gold. This was important because the treasure equalled the entire royal income, enriching Elizabeth and her investors. However, the voyages also escalated tensions with Spain \u2014 Philip II saw Drake as a pirate. Drake\u2019s raid on Cadiz in 1587 destroyed around 30 Spanish ships and delayed the Armada by a year, buying England crucial preparation time. His role as vice-admiral during the Armada in 1588 demonstrated how exploration had directly strengthened English seamanship and naval capability.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: Drake\u2019s voyages brought great wealth to England. His circumnavigation captured huge amounts of Spanish treasure, making him and his investors rich. He also raided Cadiz in 1587, destroying about 30 ships and delaying the Armada. This was significant because it gave England more time to prepare its defences.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Drake sailed around the world and attacked Spanish ships. He brought back gold and treasure. He later helped fight the Spanish Armada as vice-admiral.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: Drake was a famous explorer who attacked Spanish ships and helped defeat the Armada.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: The voyages had wide-ranging effects on Elizabethan England. Privateering and trade brought huge wealth \u2014 Drake\u2019s circumnavigation alone returned treasure equal to the entire royal income. This challenged Spain\u2019s monopoly and directly fuelled the rivalry leading to the Armada. English seamanship improved through these voyages, which proved vital in 1588 when faster, more manoeuvrable English ships outfought the Spanish fleet. Trade companies like the Muscovy Company, the Levant Company, and the East India Company (1600) opened new markets. However, there were also negative consequences \u2014 Hawkins\u2019s slave-trading voyages from 1564 began England\u2019s involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, causing immense suffering. Raleigh\u2019s Roanoke colony failed, but it laid the groundwork for Jamestown (1607) and the future British Empire.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: The voyages brought wealth and national pride. Drake\u2019s treasure enriched England and privateering challenged Spain. Trade companies were formed to trade with Russia, Turkey, and India. However, Hawkins started the English slave trade by transporting enslaved people from West Africa to the New World from 1564.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Voyages brought back gold and treasure from attacking Spanish ships. New trade companies were set up. Raleigh tried to set up a colony at Roanoke but it failed.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: The voyages made England richer and helped it become a naval power.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students explain the relationship between different aspects of importance, for example over time or by linking causes and consequences.\nExample: Raleigh\u2019s attempts to colonise Virginia were important because they represented the first serious English effort to establish permanent settlements in the New World, even though both attempts failed. The first colony in 1585 was abandoned, and the second in 1587 became the \u2018Lost Colony\u2019 \u2014 when ships returned in 1590, all colonists had vanished, with only the word \u2018CROATOAN\u2019 carved into a tree. These failures were important because they taught lessons about the supplies, organisation, and relationships with Native Americans needed for colonisation. This knowledge contributed to the later success at Jamestown in 1607 under James I, which became the foundation of the British Empire. Raleigh also brought tobacco and potatoes to England, changing English culture and diet.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed explanation of importance. Answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Students consider two or more aspects of importance with developed reasoning and factual support.\nExample: Raleigh\u2019s attempts were important because they were the first English colonies in America. Elizabeth gave Raleigh exclusive rights to the land he named Virginia. Although both Roanoke colonies failed, they paved the way for later successful colonies. Raleigh also brought new goods like tobacco and potatoes to England.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple explanation of one aspect of importance. Answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding. Students provide simple reasoning supported by factual knowledge.\nExample: Raleigh\u2019s attempts were important because they showed England was interested in building an empire. He organised two colonies at Roanoke, but both failed.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic explanation of aspect(s) of importance. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding. Explanation likely implicit or by assertion.\nExample: Raleigh tried to set up a colony in America but it disappeared.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."

        marks: "All historically relevant and valid answers should be credited.\n\nLevel 4 (7\u20138 marks): Complex analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question. Students progress from a developed narrative with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding.\nExample: Multiple interconnected reasons drove Elizabethan exploration. The desire for wealth was central \u2014 Spain\u2019s monopoly on New World gold made English merchants and adventurers determined to find their own sources of treasure. This linked to the collapse of the wool trade, which forced merchants to look for new goods and markets. Religious rivalry also played a role \u2014 Elizabethans felt a duty to spread Protestantism, especially as Spain had spread Catholicism across South America. Technology made voyages possible: triangular sails improved manoeuvrability, the astrolabe and magnetic compass aided navigation, and Mercator\u2019s world map of 1569 improved geographical knowledge. Crucially, Elizabeth encouraged exploration by granting privateering licences (letters of marque) and sometimes secretly funding voyages. These motives reinforced each other \u2014 rivalry with Spain was both religious and economic, and royal support made risky ventures worthwhile.\n\nLevel 3 (5\u20136 marks): Developed analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured and well-ordered narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. Shows developed analysis of how/why events unfolded.\nExample: Sailors explored for wealth and trade \u2014 they wanted gold, silver, and spices. They also wanted to challenge Spain\u2019s dominance. Elizabeth supported voyages by granting letters of marque for privateering. Improved technology like the astrolabe and better ship designs made longer voyages possible.\n\nLevel 2 (3\u20134 marks): Simple analysis of causation/consequence. Answer is presented in a structured account with specific knowledge showing simple understanding of sequencing.\nExample: Sailors wanted to find gold and treasure. They also wanted to challenge Spain. Elizabeth gave them permission to attack Spanish ships.\n\nLevel 1 (1\u20132 marks): Basic analysis of causation/consequence. Answer demonstrates basic knowledge with general statements.\nExample: Sailors wanted to get rich and find new lands.\n\n0 marks: Nothing worthy of credit."
